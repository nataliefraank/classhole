      "I (20f) and my (20m) just had our first baby 2 months ago. We live about 2 hours away from my family and visit them quite frequently, most of my family is quite clean and respectful of the boundaries I have placed regarding my son, such as wash your hands, don’t hold him if you feel sick, if we say no that means no, etc. The problem comes with my grandmother. My grandmother is a mess of a person, she’s a ragging alcoholic, has a multitude of diseases, the most concerning one being hepatitis c. She is the type of person why didn’t mask, get vaccinated, or wash her hands( completely her choice). While I respect her choices, it makes me nervous. She is also the type to repeatedly stomp boundaries and not listen to anyone when it comes to hygiene. We have been able to avoid having my son meet her. Until now. My mom is hosting Thanksgiving, the 3 of us were happy to make the drive, until we saw that she was invited. Now I should have known she would have been invited, that’s pretty common sense, and I did mention to my mom that we don’t want her touching him and she respected that, but she also said that I need to keep reminding her (before and during thanksgiving). I’m honestly considering not going, between dealing with my son, making the effort to travel, and knowing that my boundaries and rules won’t be respected even if I keep saying them, it seems like more hassle than it’s worth. While I love my mom and family, I don’t know if it’s a smart choice to go due to my grandmother and, selfishly, I feel like I wouldn’t enjoy myself. So, WIBTA if I didn’t go to thanksgiving at my moms?\n",
      "So,my friend group and I frequently ate at a local diner. My friend (23F) saw this guy she found attractive,and ended up leaving her number for him on a receipt. He ended up texting her that night and told her he was 19,which was a real turn off to her. She also just didn’t like how he texted so she ghosted him. They never met up in person or anything.  Well about a month later,we go to that same diner and as we were paying,she noticed something on my receipt. Turns out that guy had left his number for me. I wasn’t interested,but I thought I’d at least take the receipt with me because 1) it’s my receipt? I needed it to keep track of my finances. & 2) I don’t like callously rejecting people. I thought it would be rude if I left it there when he saw us look at it.  I genuinely didn’t think it would hurt her feelings by doing this.   So she completely blows up on me that night,and then tells all of our other friends about it later. They say I’m an asshole for taking the receipt,even if I never texted him. Fast forward months later and she still brings this event up as proof that I put others above her.  This is the same friend that blew up on me because I followed her ex back on Instagram. I’m really aggravated by this,as I have no intention of ever wanting anything with either of those people? I just don’t like being rude and wanted my receipt. I’m bad at rejecting people,and he’s not her ex or anything. He’s a guy she texted for two hours one day.  Edit: I really think she’s projecting her insecurities onto me. She constantly parrots this belief that everyone is obsessed with me and wants me etc. also she hangs out with my actual ex all the time??? So it’s very hypocritical to me.\n",
      "Ok, general warning typing on a phone.  I know this sounds a little lame but here it is. I work at the same office as my sister. We both inherited a lot of irritating allergies from our parents. I got my dad's issues where lots of airborne stuff makes me sneeze, get stuffed up and make my eyes red and itchy. My sister has my mom's sensitive skin where the standard additives in many soaps and lotions give her hives and sometimes tend towards eczema.   The issue is she found a lotion that works for her issues. However, the scent makes my eyes water and causes sneezing and other allergy flares.   Now on a scale of 10, the allergy flares are maybe a +3 to whatever pollen is doing that day, but her skin problems are at an all time high do to increased COVID related hand washing.   On the other hand, I have stopped using products with scents that soothe me because they aggravate her issues.   So, here it is, WIBTA to ask that when this bottle of lotion is gone, if she would try to find something else, preferably unscented.\n",
      "My boyfriend (28M) and I (22F) are expecting our first child, and we recently found out that our baby is going to be a boy. I'll admit that my creativity when it comes to boy's names is terrible, and digging through books and lists of names didn't turn up anything we could agree on, so I pretty much told my boyfriend that he can have at it coming up with suggestions and we'll go from there to find something we both like.  My boyfriend texted me a list of three potential names while he was on his lunch break today, ranked from his favorite to one he thought was just okay. An important thing is that my boyfriend and I are both very into horror. We actually met at a local horror con 3 years ago. So, when I saw that the number one name on his list was an obvious horror movie reference, I sort of laughed it off and texted him with an \"I saw what you did there\". However, he was very insistent on it not being a joke. He genuinely wants to give our son this name.  I didn't even give the idea a second thought. My name is pretty common, but my sister had one of  those  names that she got a lot of crap for growing up. I know that kids can be assholes and considering that this character is not only well known but the first thing that pops up when you type the first and middle name into Google (think Frederick Charles, though the character in question is known a lot more by his full name than Freddy), it just feels like we're screwing him over from the jump.   My boyfriend kept insisting it would be fine, it would just be a funny in-joke, no kid would understand it, etc. I said we at least had to change the middle name and he said it would defeat the purpose, and I finally got snippy with him and asked if he was stupid or had just never been a kid before. The second our kid or his classmates are old enough to access the internet, it'd just be asking for trouble.   BF said that I didn't need to be so rude to him over something so harmless, and we left it there. He hasn't wanted to talk about it for the rest of today, so I feel kind of bad for being so harsh to him. AITA here?\n",
      "I (13 demi-boy) have religious parents. They go to church and say that i don't have to believe in God but i still have to go to church every Sunday morning. Recently, at a youth group session that happens every fortnight I was taught how to put the words on the screen for the church's hymns and songs. This was something i enjoyed as i was learning new things somewhere i had to be, and it made church a little bit more bearable. But last Sunday i was pulled out of the sound and data booth by Gary(fake name) to participate in children's club. It turns out that the children's club leaders had a meeting and said i was only allowed to do the sound and data in the two week school holiday period that happens at the end of every term here in NZ. This pissed me off as i do not believe to thoroughly in God and that if there is one they are not as godsdamned powerful as all the christians i've met have said. I sat through maybe 5 minutes of the lesson before Gary starts talking about how amazing God is and how he(Gary's words not mine) is the saviour and can't ever be wrong. So i left. Gary ran to me and grabbed my arm, telling me to sit down and listen to the rest of the lesson. I refused, wrenching my arm out of his grip and walking to the bathrooms and sitting there for the rest of church until my mother could bring me home. So, AITA?\n",
      "So my husband's family think I'm an asshole for this but I really don't think I am. So I'm getting reddit opinion.   My husband and I were planning to move to MO next year (around October) and buy a house. I ended up changing my mind because my mother died and of course my father is really broke up about it. I already had reservations about moving (the possibility that I might not be able to get a job due to lack of experience, the fact that houses cost almost 150k more up there, and also child care is loads more expensive and we are living rather comfortably in AL). So I laid all this out to my husband and he agreed that we should stay down south for a little while longer if not assist my father with his grieving, then to save more money and wait until are daughter is in grade school.   His family got upset with me and called me an asshole for changing plans \"last minute\" and maliciously convincing their son not move up with them. I politely tried to explain that I didn't \"maliciously convince him\", I just laid out my case and he agreed that we would be better suited to stay down south. Now while I do understand that they miss him, they are the ones who moved up north to be with the rest of the family. We chose to stay here for school and work reasons.  Edit: clarification and typo\n",
      "I recently finished making a bathroom and I bought a cheap framed print that I liked to hang up in there. My wife has said in the past that she wants only her art hanging in the house. I think that idea is an overreach, but she thinks I'm insulting her art by hanging up something that she didn't paint. AITA?   There's 11 rooms in the house and I'm supposed to hang only her art? Its my house, too!\n",
      "Pre-emptive apologies for the formatting, I'm not on mobile, I'm just bad at typing.   This happened earlier today. I went into work this morning, working at a popular alternative culture retail chain in the US. For the sake of the story, we'll call my coworker Tammy. I've never had any issue with Tammy before, but I wouldn't say we're friends either.  I had closed the night before, so me and my manager decided that Tammy ought to start checking the tags on everything, meaning she'd be right next to me while I was out-stocking. At some point, me and Tammy realized we were out of a certain sticker, so I went to go look for some in the back.  I was back there for a few minutes looking when Tammy opens the door to the back and says that I have to ring someone out, as I was also the main person ringing. As I was rushing out I kicked something that made a loud noise. That, the fact that I have some hearing loss, and Tammy being soft spoken means I didn't quite hear what she said next, other than the word \"help.\" I just assumed that she said that our manager was busy helping someone.  Every sale we make is marked with the name of the associate who helped them, typically either yourself or the name they tell you. This is how they track sales, and your sales determine how many hours you get. I had skipped the question and marked that no-one helped the customer to speed it up.   I've barely scanned 2 items before I hear Tammy say my name, and I turn around and she said that  she  helped her. I apologize and say ok, and finish scanning everything in. After I do, I go through and quickly mark each item as Tammy's, so she gets credit.   Skip to after I'm done with the sale, and head back to out-stocking next to Tammy. I stand there for a second before she throws down the shirt she was folding and says \"Elpis4, that was so inconsiderate!\" Thinking she meant not marking her at first, I apologize and explain that I hadn't heard her for various reasons. She then tells me that  I  shouldn't have marked her as the associate for just the items, because it would split the sale between her and the default user. I try to explain that the system didn't work like that, and she got all the credit for the sale. She wouldn't let me get a word in though, and I defensively say \"Tammy, I'm sorry for not marking you, but please, let me explain.\" She then very angrily says not to tell her to calm down. At this point, my manager turns around and says if we're going to argue like that we need to go into the back.  We both go back to what we were doing, but about 5 minutes later Tammy nearly runs into the back. A few minutes later, my manager goes into the back to check on her, and comes out later saying that Tammy isn't really in a state to work anymore, and that they need to call someone else in to finish her shift. I go back there a few minutes later to apologize, and it's obvious that Tammy had been crying a lot.   So Reddit, AITA? I certainly feel like it.\n",
      "ETA: We have been to marriage counseling. He is in individual therapy. I already went through lots of individual therapy.  ETA 2: I don’t expect him to do hundreds of hours or become an expert. I expect him to learn the basics of positive parenting and be continually curious about how to do better.   My husband and I (together 14 years, married 10) share a 5-year-old daughter. I think he is not doing his share of the mental labor in regards to our parenting and I'm resentful.   I had a very bad childhood. My parents did everything wrong. My husband's childhood wasn't much better.  I think given that we have had NO positive parenting modeled for us, we should base our parenting on research and evidence-based best practices from child development experts, not on our guesses and reactions.  After consideration, I settled on positive parenting methods, consequence-based discipline, and emotion coaching methodology.  He acted like he was on board.   My husband has done nothing except take my direction and read articles I send him after he hits the end of his skillset and it causes a problem with our kid. He's gotten resentful about the amount of reading I ask him to do for therapy/marriage counseling stuff (it's not much) so I haven't suggested any parenting books.  He's passively responsible and depends on me for his information and guidance. It's exhausting and lonely.   Last night, he wanted to take away all the stars on her reward chart for wanting a towel instead of her blanket in bed after bathtime.  Keep in mind, she's a tired 5yo in a power struggle with a grouchy middle-aged man.  She works hard to earn those stars and taking away her stars for that isn't reasonable, related, or respectful.  The only thing that would do is make her think we're unfair. He was just trying to control her behavior to ease his own anger.   She wasn't hurting anyone by being annoying about a towel. He could either take the towel away (\"Towels belong in the bathroom\") and let her throw a fit, let her have it, or go get it once she fell asleep and talk about it in the morning.  I was taken aback by how unfair and angry he was about not being able to control a 5yo. He was angry with me for not wanting to \"punish her.\" She's good 95% of the time and her \"misbehavior\" is typical age-appropriate stuff.   I basically told him that he needs to start catching up on the parenting methods we agreed on and go do his own reading. I explained I wanted a partner in parenting, I don't want to be his manager. He told me I was wrong to want that, basically.  He kept yelling at me \"Since you're so smart and informed, you tell me what to do! You're the expert! You don't even know what to do?!\" I told him I want him to take active responsibility and be a partner. He didn't get it.    I got frustrated and yelled \"Right now, I feel like I have to parent YOU\" and   he told me to shut up .  I reached my limit and I told him his loud, strong, uninformed opinions about parenting make him a blowhard.   He thinks I owe him an apology and he still doesn't get why he can't rely on me completely for parenting guidance, books, and articles. If he doesn't take responsibility for being an active parenting partner, I'm going to continue to be resentful and come off as nagging. This is unacceptable.  AITA?\n",
      "STORYTIME! So I’ve been dating a guy for a few months now, everything is great except for one thing… his ex.  A few weeks ago we were about to have sex and then he called me his exes name by mistake. I forgave him because he was super apologetic and obviously felt bad about the situation. But a few days later he told me about how his ex and him got along super well and how he only broke up with her because his friends and family HATED her…  (Keep in mind I did not ask about the situation and wasn’t expecting him to tell me all of this information)  His ex his is from his hometown and they dated for about 2 years. I believe they dated through his junior and senior year of HS and first semester of college. She now plays basketball at a small NAIA school. From what I understand she doesn’t have a great reputation around his small hometown, though.  So this weekend he wanted me to meet his family since things have been going pretty well over the past couple of months. Everything was great until we were driving to a restaurant and he pointed out where she lived… no biggie, right? Well later in the night her name came up again with his dad. And another time by my boyfriend a few hours later. Basically they were bringing up past memories they made with her. Such as “we went fishing here” or “when we took -ex- to eat here…”  This hurt my feelings because even though they were making fun of her in a sense i knew they were all still thinking about her. Which is fine??? But it hurt my feelings. I expressed to my boyfriend that I dont want to hear about the things they did and how different I am than her because even though they are saying it as a compliment to me I just don’t feel like it should be brought up. Personally, I feel like I handled the situation maturely and I honestly thought it was over with.  Well tonight, we went out to dinner with his grandparents. Everything was great! When we got home we were talking with his sister, when he once again brought up -ex- for no apparent reason… “did you see exes new boyfriend? He’s a loser.”  I held my cool, because I really didn’t want to make the situation awkward with his little sister in the room.  SIDENOTE: I also have an ex. We were neighbors growing up and we dated from 2012 to 2020. He now plays Division 1 baseball for a power 5 school. Great guy. We just couldn’t work with long distance when we went to college. But him and I are still friends and I have no bad things to say about him.  So when my current boyfriend’s sister went to bed i told him we needed to talk. I was honestly pretty upset. I told him that if he brings up his ex again (in a good way or bad way) that I’d bring up mine. Sounds fair. Right? Except that he has nothing good to say about his ex and i only have good things to say about mine. My ex is living my current boyfriends dream and I know that would upset him… but I’ve brought up my concerns with my current boyfriends ex so many times now that I feel like this might actually get him to understand my POV.  AITA?\n",
      "I’ll start by saying I’m not rich. I work in a home with special needs individuals who need care. Because of covid, I had to stop working because I am have a weak immune system. I am not getting paid though work at all, no sick days or vacation days, just unpaid time off. There were already 2 covid outbreaks in the home I work in. We are barely surviving on my partners salary now.   One woman from work is pregnant and decided to have a mixed in- person and virtual baby shower, with 10 people there and the rest attending via webcam. She invited 4 other ladies who work at the care home. Her husband and his side of the family is well off and she is taken care of and also on mat leave. The shower was also lavish. It was fully catered, large cheese platter, gourmet pastries from an upscale bakery, a custom decorated cake and lunch.   I got an in person invite too. I said I could not attend (because the ladies are still working and I don’t want to expose myself. Also I’m being very careful and still socially distancing). She seemed cool and said it’s ok.   So one girl from work suggested we all chip in to get a more expensive item from her wish list, which was a freaking $500 breast pump! The ladies from work (4 people who got in person invited and 2 who got an online invite) all agreed, and I asked “ok how much?” They said it would be $81 each (to cover sales tax as well). I was like that’s too much for me so I said “I can’t pay that, I’ll get my own gift”. So everyone needed to pay more. If it was precovid and I was employed, I would have no problem paying 81.   Day of the virtual shower, they were opening presents and said “this is from all the girls at X’s work” and one of the 4 girls piped up and said “except for -my name-“. Oh well, I didn’t feel bad. Later on another girl who I am closer to confided in me that the expecting mother said I was cheap and that the standard present was $50 and all the girls agreed saying they each paid close to $100.   AITA or am I the cheap AH because I only paid a $25 giftcard to a shower I attended virtually? I’m sorry, I can’t justify forking over $81 for a breast pump. I bought a $200 one that worked just fine. We are living paycheque to paycheque and that $81 is my grocery money. But now I feel like my coworkers all think I’m cheap. Should I have just paid the damn money?\n",
      "I'm waiting for an official diagnosis from a specialist, but it is strongly looking like I have a something called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS.)  EDS is genetic , and frankly this is where my problem is.  I have siblings, and the one sister I am very close to (G,) has some similar symptoms. So, I've been talking with G about the medical concerns. My spouse and I have only told my medical stuff to my parents, his parents, my best friend/her spouse, G/her spouse, and my husbands boss. Basically, we only told people who are a part of our emergency childcare plan as my symptoms can flare up unexpectedly, can take significant time to recover from, and my spouses career sometimes has him away from home for extended periods of time.  Unfortunately G has a history of taking my personal information, and telling others, under the guise of being 'well meaning.' Since  I do not have a 100% confirmed diagnosis , I said I was not telling our oldest sister, C, and I asked G  specifically by name  not to talked to her about it either. I stated my reasons not to tell C yet is because she lives nearly 3000 km/2000 mi away, does not have any family nearby for support (as she's in a different country,) and our healthcare systems are different – I do not want to jeopardize her healthcare on the off chance that my health concerns are an acute issue just limited to me.  Sure enough, G told C. And, she told her incorrect information on top of it. G stated that EDS is just like Fibromyalgia (it's not,) had C and her spouse run through a physical test (the Beighton Score,) that my diagnosis was absolute and set-in-stone (again, nope,) and I am officially disabled for life (which is something that can only be speculated once I have the diagnosis in hand.) I completely understand that G is concerned, may have questions, or may be frustrated that it's 'another thing to add to her busy life.' BUT I ensured that she could talk to her spouse or our parents if she didn't want to discuss this stuff with me.  I approached G after taking a night to calm down, and reinstated that I do not want her to share my health concerns with anyone. I said if she wants to talk to people about her health, she is welcome to, but please do not talk about mine. While when I confronted G, she claimed she 'only mentioned I had back issues,' which C already debunked. I told her that while I understand that she is likely very worried herself, that she really betrayed my trust, even after I pointed out to her her history of sharing news that isn't hers, and plainly asking her to not mention this at all with C. I said that she knew she had other people she could've talked to (our parents, her spouse,) and she directly went against my wishes. In response, she said again 'it isn't a big deal, I apologize but I was worried, and if you feel that way, don't talk to me again.' She called me an asshole, and ultimately blocked me.  So, AITA here?\n",
      "So a little backstory I (15m) go to school  and meet one of my friend's friend group outside of school we know each other and talk in a day to day basis.  So one day a person from that friend group let's call him Dylan started telling us about how his grandma fell down the stairs one day causing her to stay bedridden indefinitely. After that he told us while laughing that his grandma also complains about not being able to walk . That made us think it was a joke because we often tell dark jokes to each other and we started laughing with him. At the end  i wanted to make sure he was joking so I asked him and he replied that he was in fact not joking , at that exact moment i looked at my other friend , we just couldn't keep our composure and started laughing hysterically. Shortly after the bell rung and we didn't mention it again.  The next day though as we were going up the stairs I slipped and said something along the lines of  \"Dylan's mom moment\" and started laughing again with the same friend from yesterday , the problem was that someone from that friend group also heard and told Dylan. Now half the of the friend group refuses to speak to me and thinks i need to apologise and the other half says that it was a harmless joke.  So now i may be TA because i made fun of someones bedridden grandma and i have been in a similar situation so i somewhat know how he feels  but i also  believe it was a harmless joke and apologising isn't necessary .\n",
      "So I (15f) know this guy we’ll call S. I’ve only been at that school for a year now and I’ve never really talked to him much but just from a few brief conversations and just what I’ve observed and can honestly say he’s one of the sweetest dudes I know.  However, I was recently transferred into a health class for the new quarter and it’s only one of two classes I have with him, and I sit right behind him. I don’t wanna sound rude saying this but right from the second I was sat behind him I noticed he smelled god  awful . Like not just regular BO. It was so overwhelming and overpowering that I literally couldn’t breath. It made me physically nauseous, it was that fucking bad.  I know his mom died when he was young so it’s just him, his sister and his dad and from what I understand his dad works a lot so it’s just them alone most of the time. I’ve heard people talking shit about him and the way he smells as well. I don’t want to be weird or stick my nose in business that doesn’t concern me (literally) but I honestly feel for him and I don’t wanna keep hearing people talking shit behind his back but not doing anything to help. Plus it would make 5th period way more bearable. WIBTA? Please let me know if I’m being too nosy.   Edit: I’d obviously bring it up in a gentle or subtle way jsyk\n",
      "I'm writing on mobile so I'm sorry for the formatting.  So for some background, I (20 F) have a pretty estranged relationship with my mother. My parents separated when I was 6, then there was shared custody between them till I was 8 and she gained full custody and I havent seen my father since I was 11. My mother was a stay at home mom for years (I have multiple sister that are quite older than I am from a different father). When my parents were together she partied very often and drank and did drugs quite a lot and my sisters told me she was like that when she was with their father as well. My sisters also struggled with substance abuse at a young age.  With all this in consideration, basically from the age of 8 I raised myself and took responsibilities that would normally be given to children when theyre older. I was praised on my independence by everyone and was deemed the \"good child\" from my lack of following in everyone's footsteps. As a result, I havent really had a relationship with my mother regardless of living in the same house as her.  Fast forward to my 1st year of university, I started having a harder time dealing with my mental health with the additional struggle of high school to post secondary but it was manageable. In my 2nd year however, it was not. I was barely functioning and so I saw my doctor a few times and she ended up suggested therapy and/or medication. Thats when I started having regular sessions with a therapist, officially got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and tried multiple different medications. In the past year and a half its improved a lot due to the resources that I was lucky enough to have which I am very grateful for.  Throughout this whole process over the years I havent told any of this to my mother. She ridiculed and judged my older sisters over their struggles with depression and anxiety for years and she hasnt made an effort to strengthen our relationship in years so I found it unnecessary for her to be in the loop.   My friends and boyfriend have been aware and supportive of my mental health, though now some tell me that they think its unfair to leave my mother in the dark about it all. Since in therapy I mentioned a lot of my past which involved her, that she deserves to know. Some say that Im her youngest daughter who still lives at home and so she has a right to be aware about these things happening in my life or by me not sharing this part of myself with her Im deceiving her, that I only get 1 mother and I shouldn't ruin the relationship intentionally with secrets.   I dont consider being blood related a reason to have a free-pass to my personal life so I never really gave my decision a second thought, but now since some people close to me that I trust are telling me this I'm starting to feel guilty and I'm not sure if my original reasons are valid and if Im actually in the wrong or not.  So AITA for not sharing with my mother about mental health?\n",
      "Beforehand I want to apologize for my grammar mistakes and bad English for it is not my mother tongue.  I (20)come from a weird family structure. My mother remarried and her husband already had 3 kids. Two of those kids got children in time span of me knowing them. Oldest one is now four years old. Both those family's live on the other side of the country and makes it really hard for me to come visit them in their birthday. I also am a student, don't live with my parents and money is tight. I buy gifts for them whenever I have extra money. But I came to realize this means I am not given all of them an equal amount of gifts. I do not want to come off as if I have a favourite.

      "So I (23M) have somewhat recently discovered myself as bisexual. It’s been a complicated journey of self-discovery with its ups and downs, but I’m quite sure that I indeed am bi. I’ve only come out officially to a few of my friends and they’ve been all been supportive and that gave me the courage to come out to my parents (55F and 56M). Something else that encouraged me to come out to them was that my aunt from my mother’s side of the family has also come out as lesbian and they’ve been quite supportive of her and her girlfriend.  Fast forward a few months and they’ve come to my grandma’s house to celebrate Christmas. (I live with my grandmother while in university and I’m only able to attend such institution because she lets me live with her) Given how the house gets full of people and it’s a touchy subject, I didn’t feel comfortable having the talk with them while all the festivities were taking place, so I waited until like 2 days from their trip back and the house was less of a mess. I basically just told them that I was bi, it was something I was sure of and that I was getting a tattoo to kinda “celebrate” this “discovery” (FYI they absolutely loathe tattoos, but I was getting it with my own money so no worries there). Dad didn’t say anything, he just turned to the side and didn’t talk to me after it for like 4 months. Mom just tried to talk me out of getting the tattoo done but didn’t comment anything about my sexual orientation.  Fast forward a few more months; Dad is still not talking to me even though I try to reach out to him, so I reach out to my mom to understand what was happening. Mom then goes on kinda of a rant that my coming out to them was very sudden, how it made them uncomfortable given “how much time before I’ve had to talk to them about it during their stay” and “how selfish that was because it didn’t give them time to think about it and it made them feel sort of strangers in my life given how inappropriate my timing was”.   I apologized to them and that has been nagging me ever since because it was kinda selfish of me to not give them a more thought-out explanation for my actions and feelings. AITA in this situation?\n",
      "I (F23) have worked at my current job for approx 1 year, several months into my employment my long time friend, (F25) began working there also. For the first few weeks things were great, it was nice working with someone who I was very close to. However I began to hear rumours of my friend not doing her duties and slacking off. At first I shrugged it off, putting it aside as adjusting to a new workplace. However several months into her employment with me, the rumours have only escalated, as well as myself having first hand experience of her workplace habits.  Outside of work, we are extremely close, we continue to hang out as much as possible, tho we are currently experiencing covid restrictions so this isn't possible at the moment. Outside of work, I've also attempted to discuss a possible change of career or finding work elsewhere, as well as changing her habits at work. I haven't had any success. Repeatedly, F25 has been called in for disciplinary action, with repeated threats of dismissal if the behaviour continues. This came to a head when I recently sat in on one of these meetings, during the meeting, object's were thrown around the office space, whilst denying she had done anything wrong and threatened legal action if they dared to dismiss her.   After witnessing this reaction for the first time, I'm considering contacting my superiors and making it clear that I do not support her actions, as well as confirming the accusations made against her. However by doing so, I could possibly be throwing her to the sharks, resulting in action taken against her or the risk of her being fired?   To be clear I've never supported her behaviour previously, however never chose a side in this conflict between work and F25. However I feel now remaining on neutral territory may no longer be an option if this behaviour continues to escalate or continue. WIBTA?\n",
      "I adopted my best friend's kids after he passed away. I am retiring next year. The kids have been with me for a year now and I have legally adopted them. They are 6 and 3. I am still working and I have a live in nanny for them.  Their mom's family are all in Europe. My friend has two brothers and both his parents and his wife's parents are still alive. None of them came to the funeral when his wife passed away.   He had his reasons for asking me when they first got pregnant if I would be willing to adopt his kids if anything ever happened to them. I am 16 years old than him and I said yes because I never in a million years thought that I would have to be a parent to young children at my age. I have two adult children of my own.  I will be bringing them back with me when I visit and I let their biological family know that they are welcome to visit us in South America.  Even though they have hardly any relationship to these kids they have already tried to get custody from me. If I did not know the whole story of why my friend asked me to be their guardian I would probably not have fought as hard as I did to retain custody.   I am going to be 58 next year when I retire and I will be getting my kids dual citizenship so when they are ready for college they can apply with no issues wherever they decide to go. I also will be spending summers in the States so I can see my grandkids.   I am being called a heartless asshole by the biological family for moving the kids so far away from them when they just lost their parents. I have thus far stayed civil in my dealings with them but I am getting close to blowing up.  The thing is I saw those kids more than their own grandparents. I was devastated when my friend's wife passed away and then destroyed when he died just six months later.\n",

I grew up in the states from age 2-15 then we moved to Mexico so everything got 50 times worse. Since here everything is exactly how my mom is, extremely sexist and abusive. I was made to clean after both my brothers and myself, was made to cook and do all the duties that a mother should to with her own kids. Even now as a full grown adult I am still expected to cook, clean and wash after my brothers. My 17 year old brother is completely useless, he can’t even work a washing machine, while I was made to wash since I was a child and all of this is her doing. If I confront her about all of this, I get slapped until I cry.  I know what you guys might think, why don’t I just move out? Well because since I was raised to care for my brothers, I feel guilty. I feel like I’ll be abandoning them even though they are not my responsibility. I also don’t have a job because where I live, it is extremely hard to get a job, I’ve been searching for one for the past two years and no luck so I was broke. I have a couple hundred dollars that my step dad sent me and that’s enough for maybe two months rent and basic needs till I find a job in another city. But I don’t know how to get out . Im terrified of my mother because if I’m caught , she definitely will beat me til she gets tired. But I’m ready to leave and not look back. I just feel so scared and guilty about it and because of my doubts, I feel like this isn’t right. WIBTA?  S/N: I know this is all over the place but I’ve been crying and haven’t slept well in the past week so my mind is all over the place. I apologize for that.  Edit: I completely forgot to mention that my stepdad is in another county so going to him isn’t the easiest. Maybe in a couple months but for now my bf said that he will help me in any way posible to find a place to stay since in our culture we will be shunned by the town if we were to live together. The other problem is that he is also banned from my moms house because she doesn’t like him because he’s “too poor “\n",
      "Hi everybody. I (24F) have been going through a challenging time in my life. I am a professional athlete and I live abroad for 9 months out of the year and then spend the other 3 months in a training center in the United States. It's quite an alienating life, if I'm honest. I'm rarely with the same people for longer than a year, so that can make deep connections difficult.  Like I said, right now I'm struggling with some sport and life related things... the usual 20-something stuff: what is my purpose? what am I doing here? am I right for this? I desperately want to reach out to someone who I know cares a lot about me and who understands this lifestyle.  The only trouble is, he is my ex boyfriend. (40M). We broke up about a year ago after an incredibly intense, albeit brief, relationship. He was a coach in my sport, though not directly in power over me. I clung to him then because he understood this life and could help me pursue my dreams. There's nothing more that I would rather do than train for and play my sport, so that's probably what drew me to him. He's equally passionate about our sport.  Of course, there were other reasons why I was infatuated with him, intelligence, life philosophy, humor, confidence etc. Unfortunately, after some time, his domineering personality overshadowed my own, eager to please mentality and combined really, really badly with my anxiety. It got to a point where I was utterly dependent on him for everything.  I know that was bad. I know that was unhealthy. I've grown a lot in the time since then. I don't miss him as my lover, but I miss him as my friend. I desperately miss talking to him and being able to talk about everything and that single minded pursuit of excellence.  I know he still cares very deeply about me... so he would speak to me because he wants us to get back together. Additionally, he is isolated and alone in a foreign country too, so I'm sure he would love someone to talk to too. The only trouble is, I know the romantic relationship we had would never have gone anywhere. He and I want different things in life. He wants to be a high power coach until he dies and I want a quiet life in my home country after my career is over. He still thinks that we would have been perfect together.  WIBTA if I reached out to him and started talking to him again? I am afraid it would give him false hope that I would come back to him romantically as well as platonically. But all the same, I still feel like there is some as-yet-undefined role for us to play in each others lives.\n",
      "I was at a local seafood restaurant with some friends when I noticed a family with a young baby sitting in a high chair.   I didn’t think anything about it at first until I saw the mom start cutting up a fish filet and put the pieces in front of her baby. The baby started picking them up and eating them.   I rushed over to them and told her she shouldn’t be giving the baby fish. She looked at me and said “oh he’s fine. He has a few teeth and has been on solids for a few months now.” I told her that fish was an allergen and that she could set him off and he could have a reaction from it.   She said “he is fine, our pediatrician told us he can’t have nuts, honey or shellfish but everything else is ok.” I told her that since they said no shellfish that hd shouldn’t be eating fish until he was two.   The dad asked me what my problem was and told me to go sit down so I told them that CPS should make a visit to their house. One of my friends thinks I am a huge ah but I was only trying to save their kid.\n",
      "This Saturday, it's my boyfriend of three years' 32nd birthday. About a month ago, we made a plan how we were going to celebrate. We decided I'm going to make a fancy dinner just for him and me. I've bought the ingredients, including some fine veal, for the dinner.  Today, he informed me that plans changed, and that we're going to his parents' house instead. No fancy intimate dinner for us, his whole family that includes mom, dad, grandma, two brothers and their families.  I was already pissed he changed plans last minute, but what really sent me off was him suggesting I take the ingredients I bought for our dinner to his parents' and help his mom make his bday dinner. I refused to do that. I've cooked with his mother before, and she is very opiniated about other people's skills, and not in a good way. It'll just make me madder about the situation I'm already furious about so I'll avoid it at all costs. Besides, it's not enough food for so many people.   Anyways, he called me uncooperative, petty and accused me of hating his family and not respecting his wishes. I get it, it's his birthday. He can celebrate however he wants to. But I was heavily involved in plans that changed last minute. I think I have the right to be mad.\n",
      "So I've (17M) been talking to this girl (16F) and hanging out with her for a little over two months now. It's clear she likes me and I like her, so I wanna ask her out. So about five days ago I asked her if she wanted to go to the beach with me and she agreed. I had planned on asking her out there.   Fast forward four days. Trouble arose when my friend (17M) asked me to come to his birthday party which will be hosted tomorrow (Saturday). Of course out of all the days it was the one I planned on going to the beach. He's my best friend and I've known him for years, but I told him I already made plans.  He got upset and told me he felt kind of betrayed. He told me to just cancel and come hang out with him as I've known her for a less amount of time. I told him that wasn't the issue and that I'd be a dick for cancelling on her at the last second. Plus he should have told me about it prior and not just give me a one day heads up. Despite this he told me that he's still expecting me to come.  In my opinion he was acting like a jerk, but honestly I know he feels hurt, I can understand why. I tried to tell him that but he didn't want to hear it. I told him I always hang out with him. So I suggested just him and I can do a special thing for his birthday. He told me it wouldn't be the same and that he'd do the same for me if he had a girl.   This has left me conflicted. I know that I'm probably gonna go to the beach anyways, but a part of me still feels really bad for him. WIBTA if I ditched my friend's party in favor of the beach?\n",
      "Update? So I sent her a text saying “ So can plan my meal planning/laundry etc without bothering y’all too much when is (BF) going back to his place?”s he said she was helping him with gas until he got his first paycheck (he got a job working with her so they’re carpooling) and he’s helping her clean because she’s been in pain. I said that’s cool as long as it’s not permanent and I would’ve preferred a heads up first. Now she’s refusing to speak to me at all but we don’t talk much any way. My choices are tell management and get the bf out and have her even more pissed or live with both of them pissed. I think I’m going to leave it as I don’t want to live in a more hostile environment. Thanks for all the advice!  I (F26) have a roommate (F26) who’s been dating a guy (don’t know his age) from tinder for a few months, less than 6 I think. He’s over a lot which is uncomfortable for me because when they’re on a date I don’t want to be in the kitchen cooking or around so I stay in my room. Last week he came for a date but I noticed new things in the shower, on the counter, and saw a suitcase in her room. I thought he’d be staying a couple days which was annoying (there’s only one bathroom) and our lease only allows a weekday and a weekend overnight guest a week. Anything else has to be pre-approved by management and other roommates. I think he’s moving in for good as he has space in the kitchen and is doing laundry here etc. I specifically picked a place with female only roommates, but I’m not sure I want to go as far as telling the leasing office. The only pro is he cleans, but I’ve been solely in my room while they shower together, cook together etc and I can’t seem to find time alone in my own home even to cook and have had to clean the kitchen before and after cooking.  WIBTA if I tell her I’m uncomfortable with him here and she should’ve told me? I think I might be as I don’t know why he’s here instead of his place, and I don’t want to cause issues as we have 3(?) more months together\n",
      "Hey guys,  Recently I've been feeling guilty about something, but simultaneously feeling like I shouldn't feel guilty about it so I figured I'd bring it here.  I've been seeing this girl off and on for a while, and while nothing super serious has happened I've been distancing myself from her, and I'm unsure if that's an asshole thing to do, or if I owe her an explanation.  We had been hanging out at her place when she went to go take a shower. While she was in the shower I noticed she left discord open and decided to ctrl+f my name in the open conversation to see if I came up. (I'll explain why at the end) The first message I found kinda shook my reality. She had basically said she was using me to get over an ex, and once I had \"outlived my usefulness\" she was gonna ditch me. Searching a bit more she had also said that she changed her mind and thinks she might actually like me, however the first message stuck with me more.   Since then I have been Slowly cutting her out as I cannot shake the feeling that our relationship was just a game to start out and I kinda want to just get out and never talk to her again. WIBTA for this? If so, would explaining myself help my case?  Postnote: A while back I had left my discord open around her and she had searched her name in my conversations too, luckily the only message that was secretive was that I thought she had a dorky laugh. So she had been teasing me about this, I was hoping to get something to tease her back about.\n",
      "Hi all. This just happened. I was walking to my car at a campground, and 2 dogs started barking at me. I jokingly said \"Woof, Haha you're cute.\" And the woman that I assume owns them \"So you're antagonizing my dogs?\" Stands up and starts walking towards me \"Come here, let me do that to you.\" I was super confused and said flatly \"sorry.\" And this Karen said \"You should be.\" And sat back down. So AITA?\n",
      "on mobile... sorry for my formatting :(  My(24F) bf(24M) have been living together for a while. We have our ups and downs, but one of the things that irritates me the most is that he moves my things. Not even just my things, he also moves general household stuff to completely different places.  Maybe Im paranoid, but I feel like he does this as a control thing or just to get on my nerves. He does it all the time.  When we got a new fridge, he had something more important to do, so I switched everything over. This fridge is set up differently, so I put stuff in new places. He then rearranged everything & when I asked why, he said that he wanted both types of butter on the same shelf. He moved every item in the fridge b/c he wanted both types of butter to be on the same shelf. We dont really have that much stuff since its just the two of us, so he could have easily moved one of the butters without changing everything. after he used the butter, he put it back on a different shelf. So much for wanting the butters on the same shelf. He really just moved everything around so all of his stuff was in the front & mine was pushed towards the back.  He also moved my sodas into one of the shelves on the door. No big deal, thats where he keeps his bottles too. I asked him to leave them in the body of the fridge as I feel like they stay colder there, he says sure. I come back later & they are in the door again.  He did the same thing with the pantry.  He moved the windex from under the kitchen sink to the hall closet. I couldnt find it. I asked him if he moved it and he denied it. I eventually found it in the closet and he said he put it there because that’s where he thought it went. He didn’t use the windex (god forbid!) he just moved it.  I could name 100 times when this has happened. And the real kicker is that for household things, I will ask if he has any preference before I put it somewhere. He always says he doesnt care and to just put it wherever.  I want to start moving his things. just moving stuff that he has put in certain places to somewhere I think they go better or are more convenient to me. I’m not going to move important stuff, more like move the remotes from where he likes them or move his coffee filters b/c I don’t like where they are. If he can do it, why cant I? The thing stopping me is that he says it’s abusive when I do things like that. Weve had several arguments because he’s refused to do something so I also stopped doing it, and that upsets him. It really irks me when he says that b/c I cant argue it. He says I can’t understand since I didn’t grow up in an abusive household like he did, but I need to understand that is abusive behavior and anything I say to the contrary is just wrong b/c I don’t understand.  WIBTA if I move my boyfriends stuff the same way he moves mine?  Edit: I’m not as much irritated by where he moves things as I am by the fact that he says he doesn’t care where they go and then moves them behind my back\n",
      "So i’m currently a teenager that’s a closeted trans male, and my parents are not really the type of individuals to accept people from the LGBTQIA+ community.   As a kid, I always had waist length hair and have always wanted to chop my hair off and do all kinds of “boy-ish” hairstyles. My parents knew this and in 2021, I was somehow able to convince them to let me chop it off the way I’ve always wanted it to be, I was so happy with the way i looked and my parents even noticed i was happier after i got my hair chopped. After, i kept going every few months to get my hair trimmed a little until my parents told me to stop and that they wanted to at least see my hair get a little bit longer so i obliged. My hair is currently past shoulders and i hate it, so I asked my parents yesterday if i could cut it again, my mother was alright with it but i guess something sparked in my fathers head because he started yelling at me and telling me that i was his “beautiful little girl” and that i needed to stop trying to look like a guy, not only that, but he was saying stuff like “I liked your hair when it was long” and “I dont like your hair when its short so you shouldnt cut it” and all that. The entire time that he was saying all that stuff to me, i was either quiet or saying something like “alright” or “sure” which i think caused him to then storm off to another room.   but yeah, so, am i the asshole?\n",
      "So ten days ago I (34 F) underwent a big surgery to remove 37.5lbs skin and endemic tissue from my stomach. I was 520lbs last year and lost 170lbs on my own naturally which is why I was able to have the surgery. Post surgery I have had no help aside from my best friend J (32 M).  My parents haven’t offered any help and they haven’t checked on me even though I’m incapable right now of doing most things to take care of myself.  I wasn’t entirely surprised by my parents lack of help or concern but then my mom called me today. Normally I have her over on Monday’s to cook dinner for her. Obviously I didn’t think she would expect that of me today. She called crying that she wouldn’t be able to make it over for dinner because she sprained her wrist and she wanted to know if I could make a to go plate for my dad to pick up for her. I lost it on her and told her she’s insane for thinking I was going to cook for her while I’m still recovering. I can’t even cook for myself or shower or stand up right. I told her that I don’t care that she sprained her wrist and it doesn’t compare to how much I’m hurting. Then I hung up on her. I got a phone call from my father saying I made her have a mental breakdown and she can’t believe I’m not more supportive as a daughter. I feel like I’m in some whacked out nightmare and I just want to know if I’m the asshole here?\n",
      "I have a friend, lets call her, Mia. Mia has been my friend for over 10 years and i love her to death. We don't text or talk a lot but she will always have a place in my heart. I am a lesbian. I love girls and that's just.. My prefernce lol. And Mia is 100% cool with it as long as i dont flirt with her and thats understandable lol. But Mia is changing just like i am. Shes always been supprotive but lately, shes been more supportive over a certain group, gays. Shes alwayd had a few rules with lesbians and that she just doesnt want to see PDA, which is chill. But gays, its a whole different ball game. She reads fan fiction, blushes, and fangirls over the sight of seeing a gay couple and well.. Am I the asshole for hating the way she expresses her feeling towards gays? Im trying to remain open minded and not seem hypocritical but it feels.. Wrong.. To me.\n",
      "my sister and I live together. Last year she built some raised garden beds and planted a bunch of tomatoes and stuff. She canned a lot of sauce, froze some whole tomatoes, dried some, etc   I've been cleaning out and organizing our large chest freezer since we bought half a cow. Tossing some old stuff and whatnot. I couldn't get one of her gallon bags of tomatoes to fit back in the freezer so I threw them out since they were from last year and she has new plants this year.  she is PISSED that I did this. I told her I was sorry and I wouldn't touch the other bags but she won't accept my apology. she says an apology isn't enough. I asked her what would be, and she told me that she expects me to go to the nursery and find/buy the same exact variety, build a bed for them, buy all the soil, grow them organically all friggin year to replace the ones I tossed.  I told her I wouldn't do that as it is completely unreasonable for a bag of tomatoes and now she is not talking to me.   so aita for not wanting to be forced to garden?\n",
      "I have upstairs neighbours who are huge assholes, but I'm wondering if I'm also being an asshole.  The building has 4 units stacked vertically. There's no elevator, all the units exit directly into a central open stairwell. Most sounds don't carry between floors, but the unit doors are super thin. When you're in the stairwell you can hear conversations happening in units 2 floors away.  It turns out that one Saturday afternoon my upstairs neighbours, a husband, wife, and their 5 year old son, were in the stairwell exiting the building, and they heard my husband and I having sex. We're not loud or lewd, but we enjoy ourselves without stifling our natural responses, as if we're teenagers afraid of getting caught. The mother was outraged, but we didn't find this out until months later.  Here's how we found out: The husband and wife let their son play inside to his heart's content. It sounds like he runs, tumbles, and jumps off of furniture. It's unbelievably loud. We've dealt with this for a year, but there really wasn't anything reasonable that we could ask of them, a kid's not going to sit still all evening. Well once the lockdown started the running went from 2-3 hours each evening to all day and often till midnight. I sent them an email asking if we could form some arrangement around play hours so that my husband and I could take work calls during the day without him jumping directly above us. We received a polite email that said there was nothing they could do. Disappointing, but again what else could we reasonably ask for?  About a week later we're woken up at 1am on a weeknight by loud banging. Once in the stairwell I could hear both parents and the kid loudly laughing and shrieking and running around. I knocked on their door and asked them to be reasonable. The husband apologized and I went back to my unit. The wife followed me and proceeded to scream at us for 15 min straight, during which time my husband and I never finished a single sentence without interruption. We stayed polite and quiet, we knew yelling wouldn't help resolve anything, but she never once stopped screaming. How dare we tell her her child couldn't play, he needed his exercise! And we make noise too! She was too scandalized to say it directly, but with a lot of widened eyes and raised eyebrows and head nodding we finally learned that they had heard us having sex months prior. (We verified they've never heard a peep from us in their unit, only when in the stairwell).  Well I filed a complaint with the landlord and requested that they abide by the building's quiet hours of 11pm-7am, but I wouldn't apologize for our sex noises being audible in the stairwell, and didn't offer to change to our behaviour. I don't think it's fair to ask a couple to keep their intimacies totally silent in their own home. So AITA for having sex that I know can be overheard from the stairwell?\n",
      "This year, my son [8m] has befriended a classmate, ‘Ralph’, who has invited my son to a sleepover at his house for his birthday. I was surprised by this as Ralph has never invited my son to a party before, nor has he attended any of the parties or school discos that he has been invited to, including my son’s.   I have only met Ralph briefly outside the school gates a few times when I go to pick my children up. Ralph is always alone and he always walks, which is uncommon here because the school is on a busy road and there is nothing but woodland and fields for ages, no houses in sight. I have never actually met Ralph’s parents and nor have any of the other parents I know.   When I asked my son for the invitation, he told me that Ralph hadn’t given him one, but he promised that his parents had said it was okay. I asked him how was I supposed to drive him to Ralph’s house and he told me Ralph’s grandfather would pick them up from school. I asked if he had Ralph’s grandfather’s contact information and he said that he did not. I asked when he'd be dropped home, he said he did not know.  I spoke to my partner about this and eventually decided to write a little note for my son to give to Ralph to pass on to his parents, politely asking for contact information so we could discuss arrangements for the party. My son promises that he has given the note to Ralph, but Ralph’s parents never sent back any response. When picking my children up from school, I asked if any other parent had heard about this party and they had not.   Ultimately, I decided that my son had to tell Ralph that he couldn’t go. My partner disagreed with me about this, saying it would be good for my son to go to his first sleepover and that I was just paranoid, and of course my son was upset, but I stood firm.   Today, I heard from my son that Ralph was devastated as his grandfather had rented a car especially to pick them up and that my son was the only friend he had wanted to invite over. My partner says that I should change my mind and allow him to go. I worry that I am overthinking it and that perhaps there is a good reason as to why we haven’t heard from his parents. AITA?\n",
      "First time posting & sorry for all the errors, it's late & I'm on my phone  Background info: -My parents divorced about a few months after I moved out -My dad started dating his now wife about a year after the divorce  My dad remarried earlier this year before the COVID-19 shite show. Now, I do like his wife, she makes him happy and is accepting of me & my younger sister; which is awesome. However, when their relationship became more serious he kept referring to her as my stepmom. The main reasons why I have an issue with that is because she didn't help raise me or my sister (my mom has custody due to my dad's job) & there really is no established relationship between us so I don't really consider her to be family either. I've also explained this to him that  after the divorce that anyone he dates/marries I would not consider as my \"stepmom\" for at least the first reason mentioned above.  Well I corrected him again recently & you'd think I told him I set his house on fire with puppies in it with how he reacted. I tried explaining that I do think his new wife is a good person & an amazing mom to her own kids but I just consider her to be his wife. He hasn't talked to me in a couple weeks since all this & I'm worried I just ruined our relationship for being too honest.  So Reddit, AITA for telling my dad I don't consider his new wife to be my stepmom?  Update/ More info: The reason why there's no established relationship is because I moved across the country and travel is expensive between school & work. Plus we are all workoholics so even talking to my parents becomes a once a week thing. Willing to work on it though when things are more stable.  If/when I have kids they can call her whatever they want, I'm not going to stop them.  My dad called me this morning to clarify my feelings towards his wife. He calmed down a bit when I explained that I do think she's a great person & I'm glad she makes him happy, I just don't really know her well enough to think of her as family. I've met her in person once & only had a handful of phone calls since they started dating. We're currently working on a schedule for calling each other.\n",
      "My friend, Max, and I worked at the same company for a couple years. We were pretty good friends and got along very well. We would hang out at the gym and play video games together. Towards the end of my time at the company, Max asked me to be his best man when his time comes (he didn't have a lady to marry at the time). I told him I would. I quit my job and worked at a different company. During the next 3 years we hung out 2 or 3 times and it was just different and awkward between us. We hardly talked over the next 3 years  In February of last year he and his soon to be wife had a date in November. It was going to be in a couple states away and the bridal party was going to be there for a week (with the rehearsal and preparations). During that week I had an internship set up for me, and if I missed a weeks worth of hours, I wouldn't have any make up days and would had to drop out of school.   Max texted me in February that I needed to get a rental tux in the next week. I told him that I didn't think I was still going to be his best man because we haven't really talked or hung out the past 3 years. I added in that his wedding would interfere with my schooling/internship. I told him good luck and best wishes for a great marriage.  So reddit, AITA for what I did?\n",
      "My gf received a phone call first from her realtor and then from her loan officer for a condo she is buying. She is a first time buyer. When she received the calls, we were in the living room together watching TV. When the calls came in, I did not automatically stop the TV show or turn down the volume. (She wasn't watching the show ...it was background noise for her while she was working on her laptop).  She asked me to turn down the volume a couple of times, which I did quickly and without issue. However this was not quiet enough, and eventually she walked out of the room to continue her call away from the TV. She became furious with me about this incident, saying that I should have known to pause or mute the show automatically, knowing that these were important calls. And that she shouldn't have had to ask me to once turn down the TV. She finishes up by saying that I'm not supporting her and that I don't care about her. I told her that the level of upsetedness she was broadcasting to me about this incident was way too much and that i had turned down the volume as requested. I don't understand why this is a huge issue worth this much stress and anger. If she needed more quiet, she could have taken the calls in the other room or specifically asked me to mute the TV. But I had done everything she asked of me, except intuitively anticipate what she specifically needed. AITA? I think she is being the A.  Edit: she could hear the conversations. The TV wasn't loud enough where she couldn't hear. The sound had some flair ups, and that was when she asked me to turn down.  But she actually was able to speak and hear both of her phone conversations. Also I don't think she the A for asking for volume down. But I do think she being A for making this into a huge fight.\n",
      "I thought of something for the first time in a couple years tonight. Backstory - I graduated high school at 16 and went straight to community college. In my graphic design class the guy that sat next to me was probably around 30. Anyway, we’d talk and were kinda just friends because of the class. I mean, we sat next to each other in the back row so who else were we going to talk to? I’ve always been friendly and the type of person that can talk about anything so I was comfortable talking to whoever wanted to talk to me. He was never creepy though. He was married and he even knew what guy I had a crush on (my now husband).  Anyway, a few years ago when I was pregnant with my first I was his name pop up on my suggested friends list so I added him. Headed me back so I messaged him hi and told him I hoped all was well. Anyway, we were talking very innocently and he brought up how he always liked me and wanted to be a thing. I told him that was awful because we were both married and he was much older than me. I didn’t give him time to respond. I blocked him and sent screen shots to his mom letting her know my age when we met. She read them and never responded. I was wondering tho, AITAH? I was very young for a man that old to be liking me and thought his family should know he’s likely a predator.  Edit to add: His wife didn’t have social media so I sent it to his mom so his wife could know what he was up to.\n",
      "So this happened a few days ago, some of my friends say I'm the asshole and others say I'm not, I want to know if I am. So this girl comes up to me, I'm not really friends with her but we get along, and calls me the name of someone who only looks vaguely like me (same skin color). Now I didn't know if she was serious or not, but I told her 'Hi, [name of person similar to her]!'. Now this really pissed her of, she kicked me in the balls, which ended up not only leaving me in great pain but also smashing the back of my phone, which I can't afford to repair and she won't pay me the £25 I need to repair it. On one hand, I shouldn't have retaliated, but on the other hand, her reaction was wayyy out of proportion.  So Reddit, AITA?\n",
      "I know the title sounds silly but honestly the whole situation is silly so let me explain.  Me and my friend were planning to go to fright fest six flags about a month ago. Yesterday he tells me abt the haunted houses and that they’re $24 and I’m like “oh I don’t want to do that bc I got racially profiled there and overall I had a bad experience a few years back”, which he knows abt bc he was there. He then gets really upset so I say I can go to the haunted houses since he clearly wants to but then he’s like “no it’s too late it’s too late you’re selfish, you ruin everything and I don’t want to go with you anymore.”   Apparently his entire reason for wanting to go to fright fest was for the haunted houses because he doesn’t care about rides which I didn’t know prior because he never brought it up or made a big deal about it and now suddenly it’s the most important thing to him. And I legit don’t understand what I did wrong atp. I said I would go even though I don’t like going to the haunted houses and he still threw this whole temper tantrum, idk maybe I’m missing something.\n",
      "This morning, I texted my boyfriend a random story of something I did when I was a toddler and he replied with \"Heh. Cute.\" I sent him a reply asking what he was like at three, and this is the response I got.  >\"I was just like any other three year old, I reckon. I said stupid shit, I did stupid things, I mispronounced half the words I spoke like the retarded little dipshit I was, and all the adults oohed and ahhed and said that I was so fucking adorable because I didn't know my ass from a hole in the ground.\"  I was hurt so I didn't reply, but he followed this up a few minutes later with...  >\"What the hell were you expecting, me to have explored ancient pyramids or become a famous NASCAR driver? We're all the same at that age, 3 year olds are all mass produced little shitheads straight off the assembly line. You see one toddler-aged jackass, you've seen them all.\"  In his defense, I know that he's highly uncomfortable with the subject of childhood in general, so perhaps I shouldn't have said anything. He's cynical about anything related to childhood because his was horrible, and sometimes he gives me grief and talks down to me because I had a good one (he's lost a lost of friends over the years by going on seething rants about how anyone who wasn't abused or abandoned is spoiled, sheltered, and doesn't know anything about real life), but his childhood didn't turn bad and spiral out of control until he was 5, so I figured age 3 wouldn't be a touchy subject.\n",
      "No text or call to say she was running late, no apology, I chased her after 20mins and got a text saying she’ll be here shortly. 30mins later still no sign of her. It’s a Saturday morning in a quiet town and she lives less than a mile from my address.  EDIT: apologies to all saying why did I post this - to clarify/add detail the tech was furious with me for cancelling despite her lateness and insisted on coming anyway because the appointment “wouldn’t take long”. I was out by the time she (apparently) arrived despite me telling her I’d cancelled.\n",
      "I (F21) work with a guy (M27) who we'll call \"Matt.\" For context, we work at a church as sound engineers.   Matt has a problem of not showing up to work until the last possible moment. He is supposed to be there at 3:30 for Mass at 4:00, this dude doesn't show up until 3:57. Why he hasn't been fired yet is a question I have yet to be answered. The priest really noticed this one morning, as he saw I was the only one present and working. He made a comment to me about Matt \"cutting it close.\" And I didn't respond to him other than a friendly smile. I did talk to Matt about it later that day. He said he arrives late so I have time to set up, then he checks my work afterwards (he is also my trainer btw). I told him that wasn't smart, because my alarm actually hadn't gone off that morning and I was actually pretty late. We made a deal, that he would arrive earlier from that day on.   Then, he and I had an argument the next week, and I was still pretty upset about it the next day. I didn't completely ignore him or anything, just didn't speak when it wasn't necessary (he didn't even notice).   Our boss came up to me that day and started asking me questions about Matt. Like: \"What is the latest he has even shown up?\" \"Have you ever been by yourself?\" \"What time does he normally get here?\"  I just answered, in simple vague terms: \"I don't know the latest he's ever been here. I don't really check the time while working.\" \"Well, we tend to share the work usually. Sometimes I'll set up by myself and he'll clean up by himself, or visa versa.\" \"We tend to get here about 6:20-6:30\"  I didn't want to lie to my boss, but from the questions he was asking me, I knew he knew something (he's a volunteer police officer) and I figured that the priest must have said something because they are friends.  Apparently the boss told Matt, \"pixiedusttough, said you need to be there earlier to help her with the speakers.\" I never said that. I had told him (a loooooong time ago) that I am capable of doing everything except put up the speakers (I am 5'1, trying to put 40lb spakers on 6 ftt stands) and that's all I really need Matt for.  Now Matt isn't speaking to me. Yes, I get why: I was angry with him that day, but I would never do anything to get him in trouble or fired on purpose like that.   This isn't the first time our boss has taken my words out of context, but it is the first time Matt hasn't spoken to me about it. I found out through another coworker. One friend thinks I did the right thing because Matt should be there at the time he needs to be. Another friend says I should have lied because I may need Matt to lie for me one day.  AITA?\n",
      "For context, my mom(43F) has been dating this guy(43M) for around two to five years(I’m unsure at this point.) And I(17NB) am living my mom full time for the past two years and moving out soon.   So, I never really liked my stepdad. I always found him mean and he’s really annoying(Mostly his voice. He talks really loud too.) He worked with my mom at Subway for a few years and then started dating five years after they met. And my stepdad moved in with us just three months after they started dating. He was living with his parents until he moved in.   I always thought it was going too quick but it isn’t my relationship so I didn’t say anything. They were planning to get married just half a year into the relationship. But again, I didn’t say anything because it isn’t my business.   But recently, I moved in with my mom so I could finish my high school in Quebec instead. I have been given the chore to vacuum every three days and take care of the dishwasher every night. I am okay with this but this is when my stepdad becomes childish.  My stepdad refuses to do any laundry, so the dishes when I’m away for a while, doesn’t even put away the leftover food he makes and only plays his video games in our spare bedroom. My mom can’t even spend time with him if she doesn’t join him in the spare bedroom because he locks himself in there. My stepdad doesn’t even take care of our dog when he’s home alone with her. He let her pee and poop inside when me and my mom went to Toronto to see a family friend.   I told my mom countless of times to let her boyfriend know I’m not going to clean his messes when he’s a full grown man but it never does anything when I tell her.   So, as of last week, I started to treat my stepdad like a child since he acts like one. I tell him to put his plate in the dishwasher, put his laundry down on Sunday’s for laundry day, to clean his coffee maker once in a while, etc.  My mom says I’m going to far with this and her boyfriend is really frustrated. AITA for doing this?  I just want to let this man know that me and my mom aren’t going to be his mothers and take care of him forever.  Edit: I’d like to say that I go by They/Them pronouns so if you refer to me in the comments, please use my correct pronouns.\n",
      "Im 31, my dad is just shy of 50. He has dealt with chronic depression my entire life. He has a long laundry list of medical problems ranging from spinal issues to hypertension to diabetes...mostly related to his weight(about 500lbs.)   When I was about 16 he remarried, and his new wife haaaaated me, and what I was about. Now, as an adult I dont blame her entirely for seeing me like she did, but that lead me to be pretty much homeless between the ages of 16 and 18...  They divorced about 5 years ago, and he moved back in with his mom, until she died, then he moved in my aunt...who has also recently died.   For my part, Ive got a good job, Im dating an absolutely excellent woman, who is the best partner anyone could ask for. Its very VERY clear that being a good partner is very high up on her priorities, but she also had to take serious steps to get out of a bad relationship, before we met.   We...have decided we arent going to move him in with us. He does nothing to help himself, has not had a job in decades, and makes no efforts to help himself. Even with his medical issues in play, he could y'know...make calls to see about a place to live other than with us.  Am I the asshole for not risking my household to support him?\n",
      "I (50F) was married to a good man. I was his second wife. He had a son (22M) we will call Mark from his first marriage. Together we had a son Chuck (16M) who is special needs. My husband passed 10 years ago.  My husband had a life insurance policy for Mark for 500k, as apart of his divorce. I talked him into getting a policy for chuck too. He got a 250k policy for him. But with Chucks diagnosis and wanting to save for college for Mark I asked my husband to also start individual savings for both boys. Before he passed I looked at the accounts and he fessed up to giving Mark the savings over the years. Expensive clothes, phones, trips with friends to Disney, walking around money for a kid. My husband never told him no. Whatever my step son wanted he got. So Chuck had 25k saved, and Marks account only had $800. I was livid and stopped giving my husband money. Instead I kept putting money away in my own savings for the boys. My husband said he just felt guilty his son was the child of divorce and wanted him to have a happy life. After my husband died, Mark got his life insurance policy. But his mother blew through the 500k before he was 16. I used the 250k money and bought an investment property. It’s worth a lot more now and Chuck has a healthy savings from it as well as I reinvest profits into a trust for Chuck. It’s about $630k total value. I had 6k set aside for mark that I saved on my own. I gave it to him when he turned 18.  He bought a car with it.  My step son recently found out his brother has money. He lost another job so he has been staying with a girlfriend because he doesn’t get along with his mothers boyfriend. The girls parents are evicting them. I offered to let them live with me for a bit if he contributed to the bills by getting a job and keeping it. Then he could save for a place on his own. He refused that help. Instead, he wanted to live in his brothers rental property for what sounded like free. I said absolutely not. We have reliable tenants, I’m not going to evict them so he has a place to stay. He said no, he meant GIVE him the property. Because he says it was purchased using his dads money and I had no right to be keeping him from what should be his. And if I didn’t give him the house I needed to give him the value of the house out of the money invested. He threatened to sue me. I was stunned. I said absolutely not. He should be asking his mother for his money, not me, not his brother.  He called his fathers sisters and said he’s struggling and going to be homeless and his girlfriend just found out she’s pregnant (that’s why her parents are kicking them out. I guess they weren’t expecting her to get pregnant from that living arrangement). So he needs the money and I’m being a greedy evil step mother according to him.  They are calling me an AH and heartless. AITA?\n",
      "Recently me and my mom had to go another state for a funeral, so me and my mom drove there to visit other family and stuff. So anyways, we get there and while we are getting ready, my mom tells me to put on makeup. (Keep in mind I had already put on lipstick, eyeliner/eyeshadow and stuff)My mom walked by and told me to put on foundation, cause it would cover up my acne. I hate wearing foundation, and I am severely self conscious because of it(she knows this). Long story short she gets mad and yells at me telling me how I’m disrespecting her and the family for not putting it on. I put it on with shaker hands and we go about our day.   She later tells me how offended and hurt she was that “I wanted to look like shit for the funeral” and “didn’t care about her authority over me” TLDR:My mom yells at me for not wearing foundation to a funeral.\n",
      "AITA for not going away because my friend insists on bringing his GF?  John: My friend  Jeff: Me  John and I have been planning a trip for months (we are supposed to leave in a few days and would be gone for a total of 8), that was supposed to just be him, his father and myself. John recently met a girl while we were on another trip away (less than a month ago) and him and her have since gotten together.  He asked me about a week ago if he could bring this new girl to our trip, I told him that I'm not gonna make the decision for him, but that I wouldn't go if he chose to bring her as it would ruin it for me (it was planned as a boys trip)  and that it was a mistake to take someone you met less than a month ago on such a long holiday.  When he first asked he said that he doesn't mind if I say no, which is when I said I'm not making the decision for him. He invited me out to dinner last night, (first time it's been just me and him doing something since the aforementioned trip where he met her) about 5 - 10 minutes in he brought it up again and spent ages trying to convince me that it would be fine and that there would be no issues.   The only response that I gave him was that I'm firm on what I think and that I would not be going if he brings her, after I got home I talked to some other friends about it and got their opinion on the situation, which ended up with me asking him to let me know by today if he was going to bring her, to his credit he did that and let me know that he's bringing her and that it's up to me if I come or not, I obviously said that I won't be coming and that he knows where I stand on it and asked him to send back the money that I've already spent on the trip (that money would now just be paid by her instead of me).  This wasn't something that he had planned and that I was just coming along for, this is something that we had both planned together and had agreed on what was going to happen for months. Not to mention the fact that it's an island, with no cell service and no way to escape each other if anything goes wrong. I am obviously very frustrated with the situation and definitely won't be going and am debating whether or not I want to continue this friendship.  So, AITA for refusing to go because he's bringing her?\n",
      "for clarification, I am 14 and visiting my mom for the winter break, I live with my grandma and my aunt lives nearby to my mom. my mom's bf, we'll call him dee  was on his phone in the kitchen and dababy came up and on how he was getting cancelled for making a homophobic comment, and Dee was trying to justify the comment with \"it's freedom of speech he shouldn't be cancelled\" so, with that I got angry  about 10 minutes later we sit down to play cards and I texted my mom, \" what he said was not ok and he's making me mad\" so she said something and dee was again, trying to justify why it was freedom of speech. so I'm response and in the name of \" fReEdOm Of sPeEcH\" I told him to shut up. he got angry and he said this word for word \" well then in the name of freedom of speech, fuck you and all faggots are pieces of shit and should die\" in response I ran to the bathroom because, I'm a part of the LGBTQ community and he knows that  after two hours of sitting the bathroom sobbing I ask my grandma to pick me up asap, so I'm told to gather all of my stuff so I go out of the bathroom and I'm confronted after sitting in my shared room with me step sis, and my mom is mad at me for telling Dee to shut up. and she isn't mad at Dee for saying that to me, they both know I'm gay.  my mother things of it as \" a difference of opinion\" but it's much more, so my grandma tells my aunt to come pick me up and she does, and my mom is telling me that what I did wasn't a good way to handle the situation, and I told her that I'm not saying olin a house full of homophobic people, then Dee proceeds to say \" I can't be homophobic I have a gay cousin, and I don't mean it, if I knew you were gay(he did know) I wouldn't have said it but if I did I would have apologized cause I just joke about everything\" \"it's like me saying the nword I have a bunch of black Friends and I say it but I don't say it around them. \"   to me that means that he knows he shouldn't say it if he can't say it around them (letting you know he is not black not one bit)   and my mom is still on his side, so am I the asshole for walking out of the house?  (edit) about a year or two before this I told them I was gay, they didn't have a problem with it. so I'm confused on why they would do this\n",
      "My husband and I live in a nice little house with a great yard. My in-laws live about 4 hours away, so when they come over, they tend to stay overnight (which I already don't like, I prefer to not have outsiders staying in my home, but will begrudgingly accept as a compromise with my husband).  They have a dog and I guess the dog can't stay by itself overnight. That might be common for dogs. I've never had one, so I honestly don't know all the ins and outs of what having a dog is like.  The thing is, the smell of dog is absolutely atrocious to me. People always say that their dog doesn't smell, no one can smell their dog, but it just isn't true for me. I walk into a home and know without a doubt there's been a dog in the house in the past 5 years. That kind of overwhelming, disgusting stench just lingers. Doubly so if there's carpet. The smell makes me nauseous and gag uncontrollably.  (I've also never had a cat before and the smell of litterbox is apparent to me as well, but it's not quite as bad as dog stench, before anyone asks).  Because of this, we're happy to let the dog visit with them, but it has to stay outside. We got into a huge argument where my in-laws were telling me how mean and unreasonable it is to make a dog have to sleep outside just because I'm hypersensitive to the smell.  I told them that it's unreasonable for them to expect me to not be able to breathe comfortably in my own home just because they have a pet that can't be on its own overnight, and that maybe when they visit they should just board the dog or drop it off with a friend for the evening.  They're acting like it's the world's biggest insult to be told to just leave the dog at home or something. I think it's entitled AF for them to think that their son's home is somehow theirs to have a say over.  They're now telling us they won't visit unless they're allowed to bring the dog inside, and are crying and whining all over Facebook because the mean daughter in law is a dog hater.  AITA?   ETA:  I'm adding clarification so I can stop saying this over and over again. I call them outsiders because they don't live with us, versus having family that lives with you. That's literally all it means, there's no reason to look any deeper into that statement, Lol.\n",
      "I (M16) texted my cousin (M23) how it was raining heavily. He said, \"Okay? Not sure what to do with that information.\" I told him I just wanted to make conversation, and he said, \"Making a random meteorological observation is not an interesting conversation topic. I do not participate in small talk and meaningless conversations.\" I told him he could have just said, \"It is\" or something, and he said, \"I hold every right to establish social boundaries even if random neurotypicals get offended. Deal with it.\"  I told him he was being rude at this point, and he said, \"Not sure how, but okay. I am not obligated to speak to you for any reason. Right now, I refuse to speak to you period since you refuse to respect my boundaries and need for consent.\" I left him alone after this, and he eventually sent, \"For now on, do not speak to me unless I approach you first. You were unbelievably disrespectful calling me rude, and ableist for thinking autistic people should have to pander to neurotypicals, so it might be a while before we talk again.\"  AITA? He literally never made anything like that clear with me before. I have a lot to think about.\n",

      "I’m a 17 year female. My dad and his girlfriend (DG=dad’s girlfriend) sucks tremendously so I only live with my mum now, same as my sister. My dad is having major trouble accepting the fact neither of his daughters wanna live with him, and keeps being a jerk about it, hurting my mum in the process.  I recently found out DG is scamming.  Firstly, in my country there’s a thing where you can have your debt cancelled if there’s no possible way you can ever repay it, a condition to having your debt cancelled, is that you’re not allowed to own anything of value (such as a tv, which you can sell).  My dad and DG doesn’t share the same address, which is weird because they  definitely  live together. But it’s because they’re trying to make it seem like she owns nothing, so she can have her debt cancelled.   (She got scammed by a sandwich-place long ago. She worked for them, but they paid her much less than what she deserved. She also made basically all their recipes. Then she quit, opened her own sandwich place, where the old place sued her for stealing their recipes).  Their kid is also listed as living with her, so she gets extra money for being a single mum.  The thing is that she  can  pay her debt. She has her own firm (although my dad ‘owns’ it because she isn’t allowed to). I don’t know how much they have, but she seemingly spends money without a care in the world.  My mum doesn’t wanna report it because she doesn’t wanna be ‘ that ’ ex, but I can.  But WIBTA if I did it? I fear I might only wanna do it because I don’t like either of them for personal (and a few non-personal) reasons.\n",
      "I'm 18 years old and my mother wanted my siblings and I to go to our grandmother's house and stay there for the night because she missed us. When we got there we started a conversation where she brought up a wedding I attended with my boyfriend and his family. I showed her pictures and she told me that my boyfriend looked really bad and childish. (He was making a funny face on one of the selfies I took with him.)  I told her it's fine and that he'll get more serious when he gets older. (He's the same age as me, but he's a goofy person - not in a bad way, he's just fun to be around.) I defended him, that he has serious plans in the future and he's a great person.  She then said that she hopes that those plans don't include being with me and that it makes her ill to see me with a person ,,beneath my level\".  I got angry and packed my bags. She was telling me that I'm just overreacting the whole time I was leaving.   Am I really the a**hole for not staying the night at her place and am I overreacting? My boyfriend is a nice person, never said any negative about her not even after my grandmother told me several times that she prefers my (cheater) ex more than him.  Sorry for any possible mistakes, English is not my first language.\n",
      "So I (18f) didn't have that great of a childhood. When I was 14, I was dumped at my uncle's house under the false promise that my mom would come back for me. I haven't seen her since. It hurt, but at least I was with my uncle right? Well... I love him but he had some severe mental health issues that he refused to acknowledge and that made living with him extremely hard. He was essentially  this recluse who lived on the outskirts of a tiny town in the middle of the forest. He didn't take care of the house at all and it resulted in me adopting things that are seen as 'aesthetic' by kids today. I was essentially neglected. I will admit, at first I would spin my circumstances as 'i'm living with my odd and eccentric uncle in the woods in a small town. you could make a movie out of this' but I would always stress that it hurt me a lot. I stopped this line of phrasing and have fully embraced (is that the right word?) my childhood because I realised I was only kidding myself and that helped no one.  This is where the issue lies:                                                                                                                                                                             My boyfriend's sister (16f) is super into the whole 'cottagecore' and general aesthetic thing and she seriously glamourizes my childhood (wearing hand-me-downs/thrifted items, being in the forest, etc).  Anyway, last night she came home from shopping and she was showing us the stuff she had gotten. A lot of it aligned with her style but then she pulled out her phone and showed us this board she had made that was 'inspired by your (my) life'. As I expected it was more glamorization of my life (she would constantly say stuff like 'this is like x event' and then show some super saturated straight from tumblr image. But this time I wasn't in the mood to brush it off.  I turned to 16 and said 'hey 16, I can tell you worked hard on the board and it's great, I love it, but you should know that my childhood was nothing like this and it really, REALLY sucked. It's nothing like what you think it is. I'm happy you found a style you like, but it really upsets me when you compare my truama to your tumblr-made style. You've been glamourizing it a lot, please stop. It hurts me.' Both my boyfriend and 16 looked stunned and 16 walked out super upset. Boyfriend went to check on her (which is fine). He came back and said 16 is really upset at me. I tried to apologise but she didn't want to listen.   Boyfriend is on my side (he said that sometimes being blunt means you're an asshole and that's ok) but his parents are miffed with me now.   AITA?\n",
      "My wife has put off getting her car inspected and tuned up for like 6 months now. She finally got pulled over for speeding and the cop reprimanded her for being overdue on the inspection as well.  I offered to drive her back from the inspection multiple times over the last 6 months but she’s always said she doesn’t feel like it. This weekend is busy for me, and I have little downtime with a work conference and helping my daughter with her project.   My wife wants to do the inspection this weekend and this time I don’t feel like it. I told her I can’t and she could either wait there or get an Uber. She says that it’s not fair and that I offered before and she doesn’t want to Uber, and she has to get the inspection. She’s put it off this long, another week won’t kill her. Neither will an Uber.  AItA?\n",
      "I’ve been really close to this person (I’ll call them F) for a while. I spent hours and hours helping them with mental health, sitting in counseling offices and listening to them vent. I’ve even missed my lunch to sit with F in an audition they were nervous for and ended up getting a migraine. F never asked to vent, they would just start and I would always reply as quickly as possible even when I was in a bad place, exhausted etc. I really cared about them and tried my best to be patient since they weren’t in a place to really put anything back into the friendship.   Now I started having a hard time recently and assumed that they would help me at least a little bit. I would rant sometimes (the same amount they did) and just ask to play games together. Just fun light hearted games like Terraria and Minecraft not even asking for them to talk to me about issues. The only thing I wanted when ranting was someone to have heard it, not support. F talked to me less and less yet still said they were fine when I asked if something was wrong. Suddenly they blew up in my face when I asked if I had done anything wrong.   Here’s where I might’ve been an asshole. F’s exact words were “listen you havent done anything wrong i just feel like you have been really fucking clingy lately and i need some space i didnt sign up to be like your emotional support system i need time and space”. Now, it might’ve been a bit unfair to assume they would support me back (other people say I am TA for expecting them to support me like i’d done for them). But I deserved an explanation and not to be insulted. I then kinda went off (I was crying on my bathroom floor at this point, not thinking too well). I told him i’m just having a huge struggle right now and it’s not just them I was complaining to. (I later went and read our texts and they complained equally to me). I started telling them stuff like “man you could’ve told me earlier and i would’ve backed off” and that they didn’t help me after I had helped them. I also said that I wish they had told me before the damage is done vs after and that they shouldn’t have insulted me if they wanted to be friends again. I didn’t insult them, but they continued to insult me and say things like they never asked for help (not true). I ended by saying that I was willing to work it out but that we aren’t friends until then. I’ve now seen them hanging out with other people just fine even though they claimed they were taking a break from everyone. AITA?\n",
      "This is actually an old conflict, but it has always kind of bothered and I still don't know which of the two of us were the asshole.  I used to work overnights on a six day on, three day off rotation.  As I was nearing the end of a workweek my now ex-girlfriend--who would also be off for my same three days--told me she wanted to go stay at a casino/hotel that is about a two hour drive from where we lived.  I didn't really want to go, preferring to just hang around the house, get things done, and chill.  I relented however, but told her that I only wanted to spend two nights up there and then drive home so I could have one night to just relax at home before I had to go back to work.  I  could tell that she wanted to spend all three nights there but sort of sighed and said \"All right, fine.\"  Well, we spend our two nights there and have a reasonably good time despite getting into a couple of our normal spats.  After the second night I suggest we eat at the buffet and then head back home.  She says \"I want to stay one more night.  We can get the room for free and I'm having a good time.\"  Well, I didn't want to stay and have to drive back the day that I had to be at work that night so I remind her that we had a deal.  She goes mildly ballistic at this and says \"What kind of a guy tries to hold his girlfriend to a deal like that when she is enjoying herself?\"  We went back and forth.  She got her way but I resented it.  But was she right?  Was I out of line to try to enforce our agreement?  TL;DR.  I had three days off work and agreed to spend two of those days at a casino/resort with my girlfriend but wanted one day at home.  She agreed but then decided she was having a good time and wanted to stay one more day.  I reminded her of our deal and she said it was wrong to try to hold her to it when she was enjoying herself.  AITA?\n",
      "It's not even a big situation, but it was the end of my day today, which really only ended 15 minutes ago, so I am obviously still mad.  I'm an SDR and I pitch software. It's generally a pretty repetitive process and obviously most people aren't going to respond or even be happy I'm sending them random emails. Most people just respond they're not interested, and move on, or just wait for the emails to stop sending.  This dude who runs a jerky company (with a pretty sizeable Instagram following might I add, but a really terrible website so either they're actually pretty good at word-of-mouth, or they buy followers. You can probably guess what I think they do, but it doesn't really matter) responds to one of my emails with my picture in it off a cute idea from my boss to humanize our emails that:  >Not interest in doing business with any oriental people at this time whatever you come from, not interest at all, unsubscribe me from your site and do not contact me again  So not a great end to my workday. I immediately screenshotted it with his company info and have been posting it on my social media, tagging the company. I don't have a gigantic following or anything and realistically I don't actually think it'll do anything, I'm just fucking angry.  I doubt my company will be particularly happy that I did this, but I don't feel like I'll face any actual repercussions. I do feel like I might be being rash. A friend of mine already messaged me to say that he thinks I'll face backlash and that, well, I was being rash and angry and that I should take the posts down.  AITA?\n",
      "I (24M) live with my parents (60M/52F). After being out with my girlfriend (30F), I dropped her at her place. It was pretty late and while going back home my mom called and asked where I was, then proceeded to yell at me for not telling her this beforehand, along with who I was with, and for 'lying' about coming home after work (it was a random meet-up and I forgot to tell her I'd be back late). After coming home she pretended the call never happened.  The next morning I confronted her about it but she defended herself by saying that as my mother she has a right to know these things. I just stopped talking, got up and went to work. Since then I've been giving her the silent treatment, it's been 3 days now. So AITA?\n",
      "EDIT: The fuckery of this happened almost 10 years ago. Years later, we are safe and happy!!  When I moved home, I hooked up with some old friends and I met a guy. I’d already been smoking weed for nearly a decade. I was young and dumb and experimented with other  things  with this guy... as one does.  I was sheltered AS FUCK for being nearly 22. This cycle of drugs and fucking occurred and within weeks I was pregnant. I quit doing everything immediately. Except weed. I hung on to that, fucking fight me. My baby daddy (MBD) didn't. I just thought he was being douchey.  In hindsight there were a TON of red flags that I didn't see or chose to ignore. He'd disappear for days at a time. He’d \"borrow\" my money and/or car. I found out he was finishing up parole because he got arrested. I continued my pregnancy mainly alone and I got to know his family. MBD was there for the birth and the 2 days following when I went home.  Remember that friend from the beginning? Yeah, she was fucking murdered while I was birthing my baby. MBD took off for WEEKS... and his shit behavior just got worse.  My baby’s 3 months old when an anonymous tip was called in about my “drug use”. MBD left me holding the fuckery. I got a 6-month slap on the wrist for smoking weed. After that, I told him that he absolutely had to be sober to be around. PERIOD. He went down to CPS, high AF, and Jerry Springer’d me a 2nd case to be spiteful. I really wanted to believe him when he said he was sorry and wasn't thinking. I was one dumb fucking broad, okay? Being educated and being smart don't always coincide.  With the 2nd case closed, things were looking better… until he STOLE. MY. CAR. CPS again. This time for neglecting my baby’s safety. Why was I allowing him around? This was NOT a slap on the wrist. I had my legal custody removed. I couldn't even fucking fart without permission much less do anything regarding my kid. MBD just wouldn’t quit. I had to terminate my lease to move in with my parents. The day I regained custody and my case was closed, I moved out of the state and sought full custody.  I have continued to stick by what I said when I left all those years ago... \"Quit doing drugs, quit breaking the law, and get your damn life together so that you can have a chance to be part of her life\". She just turned 10. She doesn’t know him. Nothing has changed. He's on his way to prison and wants me to let him write her.  AITA for thinking that he doesn't deserve to have any part of the bright shining light that she has become and still refusing to let him in her life?\n",
      "UPDATE: When i say senior i mean seniors in high school, not senior citizens 😂. Both mom and baby is doing great. thank you all for the great advice  One time at a party, I got drunk and hooked up with a senior (also a senior). She told me she was on birth control so I didn’t use a condom.   Fast forward to seven months ago. She DMs me and asks to meet up at the park in the neighbourhood. She tells me she’s three months pregnant. Was disappointed in myself honestly but manned up and told her I’d support her through the pregnancy.   My parents were disappointed as well but we began to prepare for the baby and started taking parenting classes. During one of these classes, the instructor was talking about birth. I cannot STAND blood, looking at other people’s body parts. No way.  I told the girl that i would not be able to watch the birth and said I’d be able to stand next to her and hold her hand but I would not be able to look down there. She completely understood and said it’s fine and said she felt the same way.  We got a phone call from her dad, telling us her water broke. We rushed to meet her at the hospital and as I’d said, I stood next to her and held her hand and thankfully did not see any blood or her vagina.  Her mother looked unimpressed as the contractions were being timed and kept huffing. My mom asked her if she was alright and her mom said, “Why won’t your son just go and see the crowning later?”  I immediately tensed. Do not want to see that. The girl said it was fine and that i didn’t want to. Her mother called me a ‘pussy’ and proceeded to say ‘you’ve seen it before, this is why we’re here!’ and ‘you either see the crowning of your child’s head or you stand outside.’  I felt very uncomfortable and everyone just fell silent after that.   AITA for not wanting it to see my child’s mother’s vagina pushing out my child?\n",
      "I am in my 20s, working and staying with my parents(paying rent). I have to say, I may not be entirely in my right mind now and I am not even sure if this is the right sub(its populated alright).  I am very shy and have anxiety issues with strangers and have a hard time making friends. I am also very much attached to my family, refusing to leave the house even though I am capable of taking care of myself. My family is fine by that, but heres the problem - they hate animals.  I have always wanted a dog since young, working towards that goal for a long time and finally I am working and able to take care of a dog. For the past few months I have been trying to convince my parents to let me have a dog, I can pay for all its expenses and any damage it cause(if at all). They always refused, and asked me to move out if I really want to have a dog. I considered that many times, but I just cannot bear to live separated from my family, it scares me.  This actually accelerated to a point that I found myself angrily scratching my arms and legs till they bruise or bleed, crying every few hours and having trouble sleeping or working. I don't want to lose my job but I am really starting to lose functions, if that's a right word. I tried to see a counsellor for this, but it doesn't work too. She kept trying to make me think about myself or switching my attention somewhere else, which makes me even more angry(not at her, she is trying to help, but it doesn't turn out well). She also suggest me to see another, a real doctor, but it's really expensive and with me at the brink of losing my job, I cannot afford taking more leaves and paying for those sessions.  I tried many times again to talk to my parents about it, and they just accuse me of pretending(Because anyone can have mental issues if they can say so, right?), and all just for a dog, its stupid and childish. I could not get through to them no matter what.  I am now considering, why so much hassle? Just bring a f** dog home and plan later. Pretty sure it will turn out well, I mean it's not like they can throw it out if I say I'd announce it online for pet abandonment. What I do know is that I may just end myself over such a silly obsession, so why bother risking when I can just act first, think later. WIBTA if I do that?\n",
      "To start this of, a very lovely redditor helped me out a ton and gave me a gift code for period underwear. If you're reading this, I can't thank you enough for your kindness, this is really helping me out.  Now, on to the story:  For context, my parents are abusive (I can thank them for some CPTSD). Due to their financial abuse, I'm still stuck with them, but I'm working on it. My mother loves controlling everything. She has stolen very personal items from me in the past, read my letters. I knew that if I didn't say anything, she might make the package with the underwear disappear and act like nothing happened. So I told her upfront I'm expecting a package, what it is and when it should be arriving, so she knows I know that she knows (what a sentence lol), that way she can't act all oblivious should the package \"disappear\". We've played this game before.   In any case, after she tried to prod me about the who's and the why's, she asked me how period underwear even works. I told her and she acted all disgusted, because she couldn't fathom the idea of just bleeding into your underwear, even if it was specifically designed for it. She then asked me how that's supposed to work because she is of the opinion that blood can never be washed out of anything (???), so the underwear must be throwaway. I told her no and explained again. I told her you washed by hand, or with a handwashing program in the washing machine. She told me I shouldn't use the washing machine for just the underwear because it's wasteful. I said ok and I could just wash it by hand.   She then flipped telling me I couldn't wash my underwear in the bathroom sink because that's disgusting, how I could wash period underwear by hand because there's blood and clots and that would be disgusting. I said that she knows I don't mind the blood, so handwashing wouldn't be a problem. But she kept insisting I couldn't wash my underwear in the sink. I told her I've washed far worse than period blood in the sink (a series of events lead me to wash towels doused in urine and underpants with shit on them in the sink). Nevermind that I washed my jacket full of her own blood in the sink, the jacket she completely bleed through on my birthday this year, without a complaint. She said I could wash my underwear in one of her buckets (her stinky, filthy buckets that she never cleans), but I find that really disgusting, because while the underwear is antibacterial, I still don't want to put something on my nether regions that came in touch with one of those buckets.  So I'm contemplating to just do it anyway, because I don't think it's disgusting, and because my parents never care for my wishes and boundaries either. When my father put his crusty, sweaty socks (the socks she made him take off before bed because the smell is so bad it keeps her from falling asleep) on my  make up brushes , she just shrugged and thought it was funny.   WIBTA?\n",
      "I (19f) have been a support worker for adults with learning disabilities since June/July 2021. I hopped into the work straight after A-levels. My last organisation was horrible, the only redeeming quality about it was some of my colleagues and some of the adults I supported. Everything else was terrible, I got treated so badly there, so I moved to a new organisation a couple of months ago. The organisation is amazing and everyone here is so lovely and welcoming. I haven't been here long but I recently started to resent the work. The hours are variable, my weekends aren't mine any more and frankly, the average pay for this position is very poor across the board, although my current organisation is giving me the better end of that average.   The thing is, it's not my organisation that's bothering me, it's the work itself. I do not want kids, ever, and honestly this work is looking after adults who (because of mental health issues) act like children a lot of the time. It's frustrating and I feel trapped in a role that I can't switch off from. I feel like I'm never off the clock because I have to keep up with updated information 24/7.  I just want a 9-5 office job, for some of those who are in those positions you might think I'm mad, but hear me out. I want to know exactly what shifts I'm working every week, I want to have my weekends back, most of all I want my workplace to have a closing time where I can switch off, go home, and relax.   I feel like an asshole because I have only just joined this job and I don't want to just leave so quickly. I have had incredible feedback from my superiors since I've been in this line of work and I feel like I would let them down.  So, be honest, am I the AH?\n",
      "Hi guys. Just a bit of background on the situation. My girlfriend and I have been together around 3 years,living together for about 8 months. We initially were living at her parents place, however they split up recently and sold their house. We were intending on moving out into our own flat, however her mum asked if we could move in with her, so we could help cover costs/allow her to rent a nicer place.  We agreed, as we ended up paying renting an area of the house as opposed to going out on our own. We also ended up pretty much fully independent to her as we have our own level with a kitchen, bathroom, washing machine etc. As a result, my girlfriend and I have remained independent, starting to buy our own appliances/utensils etc while we can afford it so when it comes time to move out, we should have minimal furnishing costs.  Recently I purchased a chest freezer for my food as I do alot of fishing/hunting which results in alot of meat for me to store. I explained when I bought it that is was door mine and my girlfriends food, and we would prefer not to stor anything else in there unless it was really necessary. It currently has a bit of meat and about 13kg of curly fries (don't ask why) but isn't anywhere near full as its summer where I'm from and I'm off hunting/fishing alot in the coming months. Today when I got home, there was a bulk amount of dog food and prawn cutlets stacked in our freezer.  WIBTA if I asked her mum to find somewhere else to store her stuff? It seems like she's taken the opportunity to buy bulk food and store it in my freezer, when i said I'd only be happy to store stuff there if it was an emergency.\n",
      "So this is probably more silly than the posts you usually find here, but I genuinely want to know if I'm the asshole in this particular case.  For some context, I (20m) live with my mother, my brother (10m) and my sister. Whenever we eat pizza or that kind of food, my brother always places it directly on the table as he eats it, leaving everything around him all oily and messy which I have to clean up afterwards, and also refuses to clean his hands leaving everything he touches full of oil, so I always insist on that he uses a paper towel as we all do, it costs him nothing and he does me a favor by not having to clean it up later, but he absolutely refuses to do it for some reason and my mom doesn't care about it.  So today we were at that situation, we were eating pizza and as always, all around him was a mess and I honestly find it gross, so I handed him a piece of paper towel and told him to clean his hands and place the Pizza in there, so that he wouldn't keep making a mess. He refused as usual but as he waved his hands to push the paper towel away he hit a glass full of soda, spilling it all over the food.  Then my mother started yelling at me completely out of her mind for always bothering him, (I admit that sometimes I get a bit carried away and start pointing out whatever he does wrong, but it doesn't happen nearly as much as it did because I've been seriously trying to avoid it, and we also hadn't argued or anything before that) it surprised me because I wasn't expecting such an explosive reaction on her part, I told her it wasn't my fault that he spilled all the soda but I ended up standing up and leaving the table, honestly I was starving but I didn't want to have a pointless argument with my mom at dinner time, so I went to my room to not bother them anymore.  Am I the asshole for just asking him to use simple paper towels?\n",
      "So my GF and I bought our first house at the end of December(barely 2 months ago). The second weekend there, we had a bad storm and it knocked down a large section of our backyard fence. Apparently, the wood back there didn't get replaced during the renovation probably because it was shared with 2 other houses. One of those 2 houses is owned by a guy who is renting it out to some people, the other house is lived in by the owners who've been there over a year. The 3 of us agreed that we would seek out a cheap but worthwhile resolution, and split the cost 50/50. With them sharing 50% and me taking a whole 50% to myself. Fair enough.  I was referred to a guy by my realtor who offered to do a fix, for cheap. In hopes of gaining our business for future larger projects. He came out, looked it over, and assured he could lift it back up and put in some new posts and a few new boards and it'd give us a few years to save for a full replacement. Only $500. So that's just $250 to me and 125 to each of those neighbors. Awesome.  Except, one of the guys(the guy who owns but doesn't live in it) keeps pushing for this other bigger company he got a quote from, to do a full replacement. It would be high quality and last a very long time, etc. That's cool and all, but it'd be about $1600. I'm pushing back, insisting I'd prefer a cheap repair for the time being. My guy hasn't been able to get started because it's been raining a lot lately, so that's delayed this getting done. In the meantime, this other guy keeps pushing for that more expensive company.   I'm still pushing back, trying to stall him while I get something set in stone from my repair guy. I feel like they aren't being \"sensitive\" to the fact that I literally just moved in, and I'd rather not put over $1,000 into the fence right away And with the new fence, it's just a few hundred to each of them. Almost feels like the guy is using this as a means of getting a brand new fancy fence on the cheap, with me paying the brunt of the costs.   So am I the asshole for wanting to save money in the short term, so we can all evenly split the cost of a full replacement a few years from now?   &#x200B;  TL;DR:  First month in new house, backyard fence falls over in a storm. I agree to pay half of cost to fix, with 2 sharing neighbors splitting a half. Now they want a full expensive replacement, which would mean they get a new fence for a few hundred and im stuck paying over 1000. I want to stay cheap for now and do a temporary repair.\n",
      "I recently bought a pretty expensive book (76€, that's about 90 USD) with the money my parents gave me to buy myself something for my birthday. As it's a little hard to find good gifts for adult children, this is by far my favourite. Today I went on a four hour train ride, so I decided to take my book and read. I carried it in a laptop case to protect it, but had to take it out to read. Shortly before I was due to get off, a girl came through and started throwing up as she was right beside me. She hit my book on the empty seat beside me, which I was just about to put away!  I was so enraged, ot took everything in me not to slap er across the face. She just looked at me, shocked. Didn't even apologize. So I said: \"What the fuck?!\", to which she only said: \"It was an accident.\" Yea no shit. I sincerely hope you don't go around ruining people's stuff on purpose. I asked her if she was going to replace my stuff. Had it been a normal 5-10€ book I wouldn't really have cared, throwing up isn't very pleasant, especially in public, but 70+€ are  easily a month worth of food for me, two if I'm frugal. The additional thing is: I dreamt of this book for two years. It's a limited edition. It went on sale a few days ago and I'm sure it's sold out by now. I don't want 70€, I want my book. At first she had agreed but pulled back when she heard the price, saying she didn't have that much. I told her that I'm sorry it happened to her but tough luck and that she better lend herself some money or pay in rates because it was not me who ruined the book.  Why I may be the asshole: First of all, I could have been nicer about it. I was so mad and close to just crying, I just couldn't. I'm still fuming. Second, I could have settled for the 76€ I bought it for, not for the 100+ it will surely cost to get another one. However, if you ruin a library book you'll also pay the cost of replacement. You may not barf on purpose, but whenever I did I was nauseous minutes before and knew the time had come early enough to at least aim for the ground. Lastly, I could settle for the non-limited edition, worth about half of what I'm asking, but had I wanted that I wouldn't have waited two years. The book has a nice, blue cloth cover and now there's a nasty stain on it and it stinks.   In the end she gave me her phone number (checked it's the right one) and let me take a picture of her ID saying we could discuss it later via text. AITA for wanting the full price? WIBTA if I don't budge?\n",
      "So for context I tend to go with my mother shopping, it’s so that she doesn’t hurt her back carrying everything back to the car. Yesterday, I went shopping with her and I was craving some strawberry laces so I bought 2 packets with my own money. I paid for them after my mother had bought her food and pocketed them, helping her bring the bags to the car. When we got home she had a girls night with some of her friends, i ate one packet and saved one for today cause she and my dad were also going out today. I went to go cook lunch today, and realised that my brother had eaten the other packet. I told my mother that he had eaten one of my strawberry laces, and she told me that I shouldn’t be such a tell tale and she had allowed it. When I asked her why, she told me it was because I would not have gotten them if she hadn’t driven me there. I got upset with her and stormed off. I feel really guilty and can understand where she’s coming from but I payed for it with my own money.\n",
      "Mandatory on mobile disclaimer. Sorry if it comes out weird. English is not my first language.   So I (20F) work part-time as a cashier in a small shop in a sketchy part of the city. Because the neighbourhood where the store is located isn’t the safest of regions and we deal with a lot of money, cashiers are required to stay behind a bullet proof glass and do all transactions through a small hole cut in the glass.   Obviously it’s hard to talk to people from the other side, so we have a small two way microphone to communicate with the costumers. For the five months I’ve been working there, there is a regular costumer, we’ll call him A (60?M) who comes in at least twice a day. A usually comes directly to my register and proceeds to spend at least 20 minutes there, telling me random facts about his family and flirting with me (telling me I look beautiful or that he would love to take me out to dinner).   I usually ignore him, but lately I’ve been getting annoyed, he holds up the line, is rude to other costumers and treats me like I’m there for his pleasure. I started turning off my microphone when I see him coming and I pretend we have been having technical issues so I can’t hear him (and he can’t hear me) and he leaves quicker.  I think it’s a pretty good, non-confrontational way of dealing with him, but I told my friend and he told me A is probably lonely and just needs someone to talk to and that I should suck it up.   So Reddit, AITA?  Tl;dr: annoying costumer comes in and I turn of my microphone so I can’t hear him and he leaves.\n",
      "She had minor surgery a week ago. It was not life threatening. It didn’t even happen in a hospital. But I know the recovery is a bit painful. I am currently taking a summer math class for college. It’s a lot of homework and tests. I’ve been really busy with that. Some days I’m doing math from 9am to 6pm. I don’t live with her and my parents anymore. I live almost 2 hours away. My mother tells me a few days ago that my sister has been crying because she misses me. So I text my sister a lot for 3 straight days and never get a reply  back. I tell my mother and finally my sister answers. She says, “I’m not texting because I’m in pain. But I’m lonely. I know she has been recovering on the couch playing her switch all day. I tell her I’m busy for a while because of this class so I can’t come anytime soon. Her reply is “I hate you i just want people around oh my god. Because I’m so lonely and depressed.” This immediately irks me. She says can’t text but she can play on a switch all day. She has always been manipulative. My mother knows this and has even said it to me. She has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I feel like she is just using this to guilt me into going to see her. I feel like I do not have a good relationship with her because of things that have happened in the past. My mother texted me today saying “I’m home today if you’d like to visit. Or we can come and visit you.” I want to tell her “no I won’t be manipulated, my sister can wait.”\n",
      "So my (25F) sister (28F) will marry next month (we are all vaccinated). I am very excited, she and I picked dresses together and even though we don't get along all the time, like siblings do, we always make up in the end.  Now my mother any I spoke last week and she asked me if my sister told me the seating arrangements for the wedding. I was suprised, because I spoke with my sister like the day before and she didn't mention anything. So my mum told me that I and my SO will be sitting with my step siblings and my cousins.  THE PROBLEMS  My \"step siblings\" are the kids of my dads new wife. I get along with his wife VERY well, but I only see her kids like 3 times a year and so we don't really have a lot to say to each other. My dad also married his new wife like two years ago, so we don't have any sibling relationship. We also had a few encounters, that did not go very well.  My 3 cousins are my aunts kids, from my mothers side. When my grandmother died over 15 years ago they disowned my mum and cut all contact with us. We couldn't even go to my grans funeral. They started to spread sh*t about my mother and I hated the whole family ever since. I didn't want to have anything to do with them. Well around 4 years ago my mum told me my cousins wanted to have contact with her again and if I wanted to meet them, too. I didn't and I told her, but she pressured me to do so, because she was so happy they wanted to meet her and us. As far as I am concerned they are not family to me. So now every easter I play a sharade by being polite and nice to them and it makes me physically sick every time.   So now I will sit at a table with all of them. As far as I am concerned they all are not really family to me. When my mum told me the seating arrangements I said \"well, sounds like we will sit at the side table then\", because I feel like we have been pushed away to the side, like you do with kids at christmas or another event, so they will be quiet and not bother the other adults. My mum scolded me for saying that, because it was rude, but I don't see it that way. It is like seating me with complete strangers.  PLEASE REMEMBER: I will NOT tell my sister any of this. I will NOT complain and ask her to be seated somewhere else. I KNOW that no one cares about the given seats after dinner is done, so I will definatelly not sit there for the whole evening. But I still think that she knew how I would feel.   So AITA for saying that my SO and I will be sitting at the side table at my sisters wedding?\n",
      "So I (F24) recently rekindled my passion for fishing and have started going as often as I can at my local lake. The area I live in has a large lake in the center of town and many reserves, parks and camping areas around it. Recently I wanted to go night fishing at the lake but my parents freaked out and said it was too dangerous? I told them to relax as it is a very remote, quiet area, I would have my phone and a large knife in my tackle box and I'm a grown woman who has been to other countries alone and knows how to take care of myself.  My mother got so distraught that she drove all the way out to my fishing spot and insisted on sitting next to me in the cold, bemoaning how I was putting myself at risk and what if some drunkard or predator or kidnapper or other random danger came along? I told her she was making up stories to scare herself and the chance of that happening in a deserted park next to a lake far from the pubs and bars in a very small town is slim.   She says I'm gambling with my safety but when we returned back to our cars from the last trip hers and mine were literally the only ones there and there was not a single soul except us in the park. I think she is being ridiculous and she says I'm being \"flippant and hot-headed\". Would I be the asshole here or what?\n",
      "Alright, so. My aunt thinks that she's better than anyone else, she has gotten into a lot of fights with my mother (a nurse) because she thought she knew better than her, and she has also said f*** you to a family friend that's a lawyer, thinking again that she's better than anyone else.  Last week there was an event, so i decided to go since i rarely get out of my house. i was wearing my favorite hoodie and an expensive pair of shoes and white jeans.  My aunt's grandson wanted to dance, so she literally passed him over the table and kicked a plate of sausage and oil onto my pants and shoes. Since the pants were brand new i got mad at her grandson and told him \"Come on dude, be more careful!\". My aunt then said that \"It isn't so bad, why are you such a brat?\", so i got visibly upset and said \"I'm being a brat because you passed a kid over the f***ing table and spilled oil on my pants\"!  She got mad and i straight up sat up and left. I heard her mutter something behind her breath but didn't notice what.  AITA for yelling at my aunt and her grandson?  Edit: Family events happen at a restaurant owned by a family friend.   Also i'm 13.\n",
      "I have a friend that I talk to usually once a week that I used to work with. We were just friends and that was mutual. One day I went to message her and noticed that she had blocked me. I messaged her from another account and someone from her account whom I believe to be her boyfriend said \"I have a boyfriend now bye\" and then \"Leave my girl alone\", which is totally unlike her and I don't know why she would do this being that we were just friends. We never dated in the past either.  I may be TA for trying to contact her after I got blocked, but that's out of character for her and if we really couldn't talk she'd tell me instead of just blocking me like that. If it is indeed her boyfriend logging into her account as I suspect, I feel she would like to know that he's going around blocking her male friends because he's insecure. I see that as a toxic relationship and would want her to know about it before it goes too far.  TLDR Aita for trying to message a friend from a different account after her boyfriend blocked me from her account?\n",
      "I and my ex split when our daughter (13) was about two, and have always had split custody, 50/50. My ex remarried when our daughter was five, and now has two younger kids. Her husband also has a son our daughters age.  I pay for a phone for her so she can keep in contact with both of us, she's smart with it and its never been an issue before. When she's at her moms she texts me quite a bit, she has cats here she wants to be updated on mostly.   Anyway, I dropped her off at school on Monday, and her mom picked her up like usual. She texted me on and off through school, and once more when she was picked up, but I didnt hear from her again that day.  It was strange, she always messages me before bed - but I brushed it off, she's growing up. She'll stop texting me goodnight one day.  On Tuesday no messages again, so I shoot a text to her mom, who doesnt reply. After school I finally get a text from my daughter, which literally reads, \"daddy help\". Thats it, no response after I messaged her back. Obviously I'm thinking a hundred and one things.  I text her mom and call her, no reply. So I hop in my car and drive over, and... she's fine. Ish. She sees me, comes bolting out, asks if I can bring her home.  I have a lot of questions, but apparently so does her stepdad. He comes storming out, asks what I think I'm doing, etc. Its their week, I shouldn't be picking her up yet.  I explain my issue, he gets all big guy, and yells at my daughter for scaring me, which was not taken lightly by me.   Anyway, turns out they were on an \"electronics detox\" and all electronics have been locked away. My daughter got upset on Monday night and her stepbrother made fun of her, which continued through to the next day at school. She snuck onto her phone when she got home to text me, but got caught and had it locked away further.  Her mom got home a few minutes after the initial argument, and I told her she shouldnt be doing something like this with my daughter without my approval. That phone is my property, and I say she can use it to contact me if need be. Lock it up during the day if you must, but let her say goodnight at least.  She apologised for that, but stuck by her husband in the fact that I shouldnt of just shown up.   I told her I texted her, she said her phone was also in lock up, so I should of tried the housephone or her work phone. Personally I think calling her place of work to discuss our kid is absurd, and I dont have their house phones number.   I took my daughter home as she didnt want to stay, but its been tense. Obviously they arent communicating because they're still on detox, but my parents have since agreed with her, claiming that she's the other parent and if anything happened to her I would of been told, I need to trust her judgement, etc.   Which I get, but she wasnt responding, either.   So, aita? Did I overreact?  ETA: This account is locked so I cant reply anymore lol, but I appreciate the comments. Thank you.\n",
      "I (23F) went to the zoo yesterday with my family and friends. We were at the Siamang enclosure and the monkeys were right up against the glass at the viewing platform we were at.   Now, these siamangs were being very active, making a lot of noise and interacting with each other already. It was bloody awesome to see.   However, one of the Siamangs was sitting right up against the glass and not doing much. So this woman (maybe in her thirties) and her toddler were next to me. The woman starts banging on the glass at the monkey (we’re talking fist banging on glass here). And I and another woman told her “don’t bang on the glass”.   Right after she finished, her daughter banged on the glass the same way her mum just did. And again, I said “don’t bang on the glass please”. The mother got upset by this and told me “there were no signs to say not to bang on the glass”. I replied “it doesn’t matter that there are no signs, it’s common zoo courtesy to not bang on the glass so you don’t upset the animals”. She replied that her daughter is only little and doesn’t know any better.   Here’s where I think I’m the asshole, as to be fair I’m a childless 23 year old. I told her “yes your daughter is little but it’s your job to be teaching her and setting an example. None of these other kids are banging on the glass because none of their parents are doing so”. The woman then picked up her daughter and they left the viewing area in a huff.   So reddit, AITA for telling a parent how to parent their kid?\n",
      "I (25 yr old male) have a job in Japan right now as an English teacher. I work at a private company that has only two employees. They are me and my girlfriend of four years (26yr female).  My boss asked us about a month ago if we could stay a little past our contact end in case the new teachers couldn't come due to covid regulations in Japan and elsewhere. We accepted believing that we would just be helping the owner. I, personally, have a residence card that ends on April 5th  My last day of work is April 2nd. I found out that the new teachers were coming, through him. I had been asking him to extend my visa from that month he asked, for about a month. He assured me he would. I came in to work today and asked him how it was going and he said he didn't know if they would extend my visa for \"nothing\". Essentially meaning he hadn't tried or checked. So now I'm stuck having to pay to take a 40 dollar train two ways and pay 40 more for an application to stay as a tourist after my visa ends in order to clean my apartment and prepare to go home.He has not offered to reimburse me. In fact it seems he has thought little of what I have to do because he has his new teachers coming today and tomorrow. He has not offered to drive me, nor has he offered to assist me in helping me file documents. He merely shrugged when I asked if I had to go in person. I stayed in good faith, and it took my questioning,  not his advice, to understand about a week in advance of my visa end, that I had to do something. Furthermore, he asked my girlfriend if she was free on Saturday. When she said yes, he told her to take the new teachers shopping, even though she only works Monday through Friday. Would I be the asshole for quitting? Edit1 It seems necessary that I explain My GF and her visa. She is fine,I would for anything and everything make sure that were the case. Her visa expires in August, so she is okay.I should also add that I have done multiple things on weekends with the boss and my GF, regardless of contract, but they were for company parties...if you could call them such. However, this is merely an outside duty he asked her to perform. Edit2 I have considered quitting in the past for other things. But  have always felt bad for the people who really liked talking and learning from me.\n",
      "On mobile on sorry for any formatting issues.   I am a freelancer and I have been working for this one company for the past 2 years. The head boss hired me and we quickly became close friends (bad move in retrospect).   We had group plans to see a movie on Sunday, but I found out my Aunt passed away and her funeral is on Sunday. The funeral is a three hour drive away so my family wants to stay overnight. Due to legal issues with her divorce she was forced to move back into her home town, so if she comes into town she needs to get a hotel.   Her and I had a work phone call that she basically told me the next steps in the project in a not nice/ unprofessional way (which I think she realized). But I am used to that so just accepted it. When we finished, I realized I had to tell the group chat I couldn’t make the movie anymore. I got a private text back saying “You owe me a phone call”. I call her,  she is enraged, and accuses me of canceling because of the work phone call, telling me she can’t rely on me, and that I cancel all the time (which I don’t think I do, or I do it as early as possible). On the phone I apologize and say it’s out of my control. She says she understands the death happens but is clearly really angry at me. I also offer to pay for her hotel (even through I suspect the company would pay for it).   Honestly, she gets upset at me about once a month now.   On my walk home I text her inviting her out on Saturday night instead. An hour later I get this text saying “I can’t afford another hotel. I am letting you know I have removed you from my Instragram and putting a hold on us until I get back. I need you to respect my need for a break unless it’s an emergency. Hugs to your family”. This triggers an anxiety attack in me but I finally respond “I do not understand but will respect your decision”. She is out of town of work events until March.   The only other time I cancelled something was a conference trip to NOLA, that I would have had to pay myself but she was also treating as her 50th Birthday party.   So I don’t understand how me cancelling a movie causes this extreme of a reaction. So Am I The Asshole?\n",
      "This morning I stopped at the local dollar store for a few necessities. The kids (almost 2 and almost 3) were at home with the wife who has been spending most of her time lately at the hospital with her mom who is awaiting heart surgery. She is exhausted and stressed to the max. The point is I was trying to get what I needed and get back to them as quickly as possible. Because toddlers.  The checkout area of the store is “walled” off with some 4’ tall shelves displaying candy, batteries, gift cards, etc. There are two narrow openings in the wall - one exit facing the doors, the other an entrance to the line. There is a sign that says “Line Forms Here” with a nice, big yellow arrow. I was standing right in the entrance next to the sign, next in line. The person ahead of me was at the register right in front of me. She completed five separate transactions (which took a while) just to juggle some coupons and save $5. It was a little annoying but I have been in situations where $5 meant the difference between eating that night or going hungry, so it’s all good.   Around transaction #3, an older gentleman (I am mid-30s for reference, he looked to be in his 60s) walked through the checkout area exit and stood right there in the maybe 2.5’ between me and five-transactions lady. He looked at me so there’s no way he didn’t see me. He didn’t have anything in hand and was making small talk with the cashier so I didn’t say anything at first thinking maybe he just had a question or knew the cashier.  As 5TL grabbed her last receipt and pushed her shopping cart away, Old Guy pulled out his wallet and started walking toward the register. At this point I took a big step around him and held my basket out to my left, effectively blocking him without touching him.  Me: “Excuse me sir, but you cut the line.”  OG: “Oh did I?” Me: “Yeah. The line starts at the sign that says ‘Line Forms Here’ - the sign that I was standing by when you walked up in front of me.” OG: “Yes, I see it.” Me: “Ok. Look I’m not trying to be a dick but that’s just not how we do things. I have things to do too, kids to get home to. We all wait our turn.”  He half-heartedly apologized then looked back to the line (maybe 5 deep now) for sympathy, asking if he had cut in front of any of them too (he had not as I was the only person in line when he walked up). He seemed to find it and I got a couple dirty ‘YTA’ looks.   AITA for speaking up and/or how I did it? I was assertive but I don’t think I was rude or aggressive. I did say “dick” but I didn’t call him that and no kids were around. Had the guy asked to go ahead of me for some legitimate reason I would’ve let him. But he didn’t. Or if he was obviously struggling to walk or stand... but he wasn’t. I get the feeling he was doing what a lot of older folks do around here which is use their age for sympathy and perks. And line-cutting.\n",
      "For context, we are both 17 and grew up with very similar financial backgrounds (basically, we could afford food and the occasional road trip, but where my family saved up, his family took out loans to go on big fancy trips and to buy things)  Friend and I used to be really close, but as we got older and I started noticing that, even though our parents lived similar lives, his attitude was more \"I deserve everything I want\" and mine was \" I have to earn everything I want\". This wasn't a problem until we entered high school, so I distanced myself.   His birthday is coming up, his parents asked what he wanted for his 18th, and he posted on Twitter about how his parents never do anything for him and how he \"just wants a memorable 18th birthday\" and his parents \"don't do anything for him\" (he's literally always gotten everything he's asked for.)   When I asked what he asked for, he said a new car and a trip to Disneyland (we live in Washington. Airfare isn't exactly cheap).   His parents finally put their foot down and said no. He drives a 2016 Nissan altima with all sorts of neat additions. He also just got back from California with his boyfriend. He refuses to get a job on the basis of anxiety (we BOTH have anxiety, I've had two jobs and just got my third which I hope to maintain until I can afford college. On top of that, I've been diagnosed and medicated and he has not) but he says his parents should pay for his college, car, gas, insurance, etc because he won't get a job.   Now, usually I can block out his bullshit, but he's been bitching in a group chat for literally the past two days about this and I want to talk to the group chat about other things. I changed a tire today! That's cool! But I can't tell them that because he's being all \"woe is me\"   Except I messaged a few people in the group chat, privately, and everyone I messaged is sick of his shit too. Except nobody wants to be rude and tell him he's being entitled and asking for too much. I even offered to maintance his car for him (I'm REALLY good at cars. I love cars. They're so cool!) and he says he just wants a new one from 2020.   WIBTA if I called him out in the group chat, saying that I agree with his parents and that it's way to much to ask, and then bitch about in a group chat and refuse to let other people change the subject? I feel like I should say something but my mom and my friends are worried about \"rocking the boat\" but we're all sick of it (my mom is sick of hearing me bitch about him.)\n",
      "To clarify some things quickly; My friend goes by they/them and this is not a “I have feelings for one of them so I can’t be happy” kind of deal, their “boyfriend” is just.. awful.   I know friends are supposed to be supportive and there for you so maybe I didn’t approach it right but there’s just so much with this guy and hearing my friend moon over him after an earlier interaction in which we were both discussing nasty comments he made towards our underage friend is just. Jarring. And I finally admitted it was bothering me.   For context as to why I don’t like my friends boyfriend;    Boyfriend was 26 when they first met and basically groomed them and had sex with my friend the day they turned 18.    -Boyfriend constantly makes nasty lewd comments about our underage 16 year old friend. Like really nasty shit asking my friend if a threesome is ever going to happen and basically sexualizing younger friend everytime they see them online.   -Boyfriend has constantly moved friend to tears, calling them ugly or being outright mean for no reason, one time my younger friend and I came over only to find friend in tears over their boyfriend comparing them to a clown. One time their boyfriend “broke up” with them and claimed he was going to get married just to hurt my friend.!  -Boyfriend insults their fashion sense constantly, making them insecure and weary about what they wear, they almost give up Jfashion hobby because of it.  -Boyfriend is transphobic and does not respect my friend or their identity, he calls them a she all the time and doesn’t bother trying to correct himself. He’s also racist as shit, that’s not an assumption my friend literally told me he said he “doesn’t like “Nxggers”  -Boyfriend has borrowed money and hasn’t payed my friend back, like 200+ plus, makes excuses to not pay it back constantly.  -Boyfriend has bluntly told my friend if he accidentally got them pregnant he would dip and go “back to Mexico”   Stuff like that and it’s all been building up. My friend has a history negative mental issues so I didn’t feel right telling them to break it off, and nowadays I mostly just respond as fake positively as I can to their excited text messages about the guy because they deserve to be happy, and I can’t put a hamper on that. They’ve told me constantly how this guy is their favorite person.   It’s always lowkey irritated and upset me with how much they make excuses for him, and that they rub it off with out regard when their boyfriend is being an asshole to them or being creepy about their friends. I understand my friend was basically groomed but I couldn’t hold my tongue today.  And so earlier today my friend shows me screenshots of their boyfriend sexualizing our underage friend with the caption “eugh he’s so gross”   The picture in question being sexualized was a picture of underage friend eating a pickle innocently and he, a 27 year old fucking man felt he needed to make a comment. Both my friend and I discussed it with disgust and they were all like “eugh he’s so nasty” and then now, several hours later they send me a barrage of messages about how they’re going to an expensive date with their boyfriend and bought a new dress and all this stuff for him and I couldn’t bottle it up and responded;  “ name  this is the same guy who made inappropriate comments about  young friend  earlier and I really don’t feel comfortable pretending to be happy for you atm”   And they responded with a simple “oh ok” and deleted all their messages about him. I feel kinda bad and that I was really blunt, I don’t want to hurt their feelings but it just makes me uncomfortable at this point, knowing the things he’s done, which may I add is all things my friend has TOLD ME, I don’t have the energy to find reasons to not like their boyfriend, they constantly complain to me when their boyfriend does this shitty stuff like making nasty comments (along with all the things I listed) and then hours later they send me some lovey dovey stuff about him and While I usually go along, this time I couldn’t pretend to be happy for them.  Please give me feedback, I just, I’m kind of confused and worried I put a dent in our friendship.\n",
      "Last year I (F25) moved back home after living abroad for a few years to do some further studying for a year. I have always been very organised and logical with practical things. My (M30) brother also moved back home for a new work assignment and so did my dad (M60). We all live in the family house. Since we have both lived in the house, I feel like I have become the family secretary. Calling family members to organise things, reminding everyone of upcoming deadline (such as taxes), doing the food shopping, cooking, cleaning. At first, I didn’t mind doing this because I was living rent free (So is my brother) but over the year, I feel that I am the go-to person to fix all problems.  My brother is useless with Admin due to his busy work schedule. I often find him calling me to fix all his problem followed by a rant. I don’t mind helping, I know that sometimes things just happen. My issue is that his issue is normally because of not doing something earlier, for example for renewing his id card has led to a whole number of issues that I’ve had to help him fix. Same issue with his bank cards and phone numbers. Last week I had enough, and I told all my family members to stop asking me for help and that if they call me for help, unless its an emergency I will not help because it can take up some of my time. Everyone agreed to this and apologies for taking advantage of my happiness to help.  Today my whole family went out but me and my brother called me and asked me to organise something for later. I refuse and told him he also has a phone. I could hear my mother in the background say it was just a call.  I am trying to set my boundary, but I feel that I could easily have done. AITA?\n",
      "My boyfriend and I moved into a new house about 4 months ago. The people directly next to us have a habit of playing very loud music, very late at night, every single weekend. This goes well past midnight, when city noise ordinance says \"quiet time\" is 10pm. We try to ignore ir, but we have a very small house and can hear it from literally every room, with the bedroom being the worst. I work early Saturday mornings and the music makes it very difficult to fall asleep.   Would I be the asshole if I called the local police and complained about the noise?\n",
      "I (F23) have a coworker, let's call him M (M29) who I don't exactly get along with. We don't exactly not like each other, we just don't care to discuss anything more than work issues. We weren't always like this, we used to get along and even worked together all the time. After the pandemic, he changed and wanted nothing to do with me. I tried talking to him about once or twice and he said nothing was the matter. I left it alone after that and we've just been civil towards each other.  The other day, I walked into work and saw my other coworkers playing with a dart board. I said it was cool and asked if out boss had brought it in. They said no, it was M who had brought it for all of us to use. I took a turn throwing some darts when M walked in. He quickly walked out and we found out that he had taken the rest of the day off. I didn't think much of it until later that night.  He called me about two hours after I got off and went off on me about how I shouldn't be touching his stuff without permission first. I apologized, but then said that if he didn't want me to touch it he should have let me know or put a sign or something. He said he couldn't do that because then \"it'll come back as harassment and that's not what this is.\"  We argued a bit more than hung up with me saying that he needs to indicate that he doesn't want me to touch it, otherwise I have a right to play with it just as much as anyone else in the office.  The next day, my boss told me not to touch it just to keep the peace. I told him that's not fair and M should take it home if he doesn't want me touching it. I told him that this isn't the first time he has taken everyone else's side without even consulting me first. He is always telling me to let things go. He makes me do the job of three people without the resources everyone else has and tells me it's going to help me \"grow\" but this time I am through. I told him that if M can't grow up, then I'll quit. He's begging me not to because \"You're the only one who can do what we can't\"  I told him I'd turn in my resignation on Monday. My family is saying I am the AH because it's M's toy and he has a right to who uses it. I said that's true, but he doesn't want it on paper because he knows it's wrong. They told me to just get over myself.  I might be the AH because I know that they need me, but I am getting sick of having to be the \"best employee\" while everyone else gets away with murder.  AITA?  &#x200B;  EDIT: To clarify, my argument is that he is allowing everyone EXCEPT me to touch it, with no other reason than \"just because.\" I want him to make that public to everyone since it isn't \"a big deal\" to him and my boss. But they won't and they just want me to tell people that \"I don't feel like playing with it.\"\n",
      "So yesterday morning my coach texted the team wondering if anyone was available to be borrowed for this other team, and he specifically texted me letting me know he wanted me to take this opportunity and take “the next step forward” into improving my game. I really didn’t want to have another game added to my weekend, but I saw it as something as something I needed to do to get better, so I reluctantly said yes. He was stoked I said yes about it, gave me the info, and that was that.   That same day wasn’t really a good day for me. My team got demolished in our soccer game, I had to deal with new crappy school projects soon, and my teammates were arguing after the game. I truly just wanted to be as lazy as possible over the weekend and not drive 30 minutes out to play for this team and probably screw them over anyway after such a busy week. So I told my parents, they texted my coach, he calls me PERSONALLY, tells me how even if you’re tired you have to keep working at it. He hangs up and tells me beforehand to let him know of my decision.   A little after I text him and say yeah I appreciate the offer but I’m not for it, and he’s like alright cool. I felt super guilty and it’s been gnawing at me all day and I thought about it right when I woke up. Now I have to see him again tomorrow and feel like shit even more, just because I was too out of it to just get one game over with. Did I betray my coach with this one?  Edit: this was a completely optional game, and most people said no in the first place. However I still said yes and backed out, not committing to it.\n",
      "My gf(26) has really long curly hair. It's very pretty but she only washes it once a week. She still showers everyday but only washes her hair on Sundays. I(29m) think this is very gross. It doesn't start to look greasy until the last 2 days and by this time she puts it up when we're out in public so you can't tell, but she wears it down when we're home and I don't like the look of it. I've always had a problem with germs and the look of her oily scalp makes me uncomfortable. The only time she will wash it before the 7th day when we have something to do on Friday or Saturday but other then that she waits until Sunday.  The other day I told her I didn't like that she doesn't wash her hair more and that it looks gross. She got offended and told me I didn't deserve an opinion on her hair because I don't have any.(I went completely bald a year ago and she knows I'm insecure abt it so this was a low blow). Is this normal for girls not to wash their hair? AITA? I didn't think it was an unreasonable request.  Edit: okay maybe I was a bit ignorant. Every other girl I dated has not had curly hair and I wasn't aware they were that different. We have only been together for 6 months so I'm still learning stuff about her. Also I didn't tell her it was gross to be mean. I was worried she didn't realize other people might think the same as I did and I wanted to voice my concerns. Sorry.  Final Edit: I apologized to my gf and told her I was very sorry and very very wrong, as people have made very clear here on this post. She accepted my apology and I asked her to explain her hair care process. She said that technically she could wash every 5 or 6 days, but that by washing it on Sunday it times it better so she can have fresh hair all week and she prefers to have a protective layer of \"oils\". She explained that it takes her close to 3 hours to do her routine, more if she lets it air dry and this is why if she doesn't have to do anything on Friday or Saturday she waits for Sunday. I did ask if she had ever used dry shampoo(as some of you suggested) and she says she doesn't use it because getting the product out on wash day takes longer.   She has 2C-3A hair and no she is not a woc(since some of you asked). We also do not live together, but she does stay over very often which is why I haven't actually seen her wash her hair. I just assumed it was an hour at most.\n",
      "This sounds absolutely insane, I am very aware but hear me out. I won’t do anything until I get a ruling.   I recently moved cross country for a new job. A part of that move is an entire gaming set up that I have spent the last 2-3 years buying and acquiring the prices for. Part of that is an Xbox controller that I had customized in the Xbox Design Lab, which is currently down and unavailable for updates meaning that there is no guarantee that the colors I need to recreate it would be available or if it will cost the same.   I did not leave my gaming set up to chance. When I moved every part of my gaming set up and my dog were in the car with me, and the movers loaded everything else and later on in the week unloaded everything at my new apartment where I had my gaming set up still in boxes, though some boxes were opened so that I could check on something’s when I arrived. In one of the open boxes was the controller. I have a picture of the controller in the apartment in said box. Shortly after the movers finished and left I noticed it was missing but thought maybe it got mixed up with something while unpacking. So I spent an hour looking for it in all opened boxes and in furniture.   Once I realized it was well and truly missing I called the moving company and sent them the picture showing it was there and reconfirmed that it’s gone. They said they would check with the guys, and would get back with me. Today they did, said they asked and laughed saying why would they take an Xbox controller. Offering to Venmo me the original cash value of the controller. I don’t know if I will be able to remake it though. I just want it back. Then laughing about it really fired me up so I understand if maybe it would be an over reaction but WIBTA is I file a police report and report them to the broker that referred them to me?\n",
      "Ok so I’m 22 now but this is still a point of contention in my life.  When I was 16/17 I met a guy in college, we got into a relationship and it was grand. His 18th birthday was 7 days before mine. So at his 18th birthday, he and everyone else was able to drink, but I wasn’t (We drank together  often before this but we were at a pub, with strict family).  Bit of context, all my life I have suffered from really severe emetophobia (phobia of vomit/ing) and I mean really severe. I have previously tried to jump out of moving cars because someone else in the car said “I don’t feel very well”. Everyone in my life has always been aware of this as its almost unavoidable. My boyfriend knew about this and was really supportive and would help me through panic attacks in public, etc.  Anyway, so at his birthday drinks, he was drinking heavily, I told him go ahead have fun but just be careful. He was drinking whiskey, and became a little abrupt when I said this so I let him get on with it and I thought he would regret it himself the next day and it wasn’t my place. Anyway me and his family at the end of the night went back to his. I was the only sober person in the house and took care of everyone the best I could, and helped my boyfriend into bed. A little while later he jumped up, and went to the bathroom. When he returned I asked if he had been sick, he said no but was clearly lying. I started having a panic attack and told him I had to go. (If this wasn’t the middle of the night in a tiny village, I would have just walked home as I feel the need to Get Out when anxious) he got kind of agressive and called me a few names but whatever, whiskey. Anyway I went downstairs crying and having a bad panic attack. His cousin was there and asked what was happening, I explained. As the house was full, I slept on the wooden office floor but was awake most of the night freaking out (is he still being sick? Am I going to be sick? Is everyone sick and I’m going to die?)  He continued vomiting for a while.  In the morning his cousin had told his family I was being a little bitch in the night and refusing to help my boyfriend, and I explained my bf was very aware that this would happen should he start to vomit. His family basically said I ruined his birthday, it was his 18th he should be allowed to drink as much as he likes blah blah (I never said he couldn’t mind, just tried to remind him he had asked me to stay that night and that it wouldn’t end well should he become ill) anyway. You don’t need to tell me my phobia and behaviours are stupid, I know. I’m better than I used to be now but I promise you i can’t help it and it’s ruined several points of my life.  But AITA? Was his family right should I not have said anything and just not come back to his afterwards (despite him wanting me to)? I don’t know honestly. His family hate me now (we broke up) but I worry about this still.\n",
      "As much as I wish this was a shit post, it’s not. Also I’m on mobile so my format probably won’t be great.   I’ve really been struggling with this for a while now. My senior year of high school I had just gotten out of an emotionally abusive and toxic relationship and foolishly got into a rebound relationship.   I don’t wanna go into too much detail because it might get flagged for violence, but basically the guy I chose wasn’t much different than my previous relationship. He was also emotionally abusive, but along with that he was a pathological liar and sometimes physical with me. He made me keep our relationship a secret from my parents. Lied about why he transferred to our school and why I had to keep it a secret that I was dating him. I wasn’t allowed anywhere near his phone and couldn’t meet any of his old friends. Some of his lies he told were he was in a fight club, was a drug runner for a coke dealer and even that he bitch slapped a kid on a dare. I later found out that he slapped a kid bc he was the girl he liked boyfriend.   He broke up with me 3 days before senior homecoming bc he was in an arranged marriage. That’s the part where I’m afraid this will be called a shit post, but guys it’s really not. The girl lived in Chicago but was fork Korea. He lied about how long he knew too. He told me a week, one of my friends 2 weeks, another friend was told a year. But the marriage was true. He posted videos of him with her and the ring.   Anyway, the part where I might be the asshole is that one of my best friends from high school shared a lot of interests with him and they were close friends. They hung out together and texted all the time. I see him on her story all the time now that we’re freshman in college. I talked to her about it multiple times and even went in depth about what he did to me. She still hangs out with him. I told her how much it hurt me that she did this. It’s one thing if it’s just an ex, but he was abusive.   Most people I’m assuming would think at this point I’m not in the wrong. Well, at the beginning of our freshman yet of college, I heard from her he had amnesia. He’d fell in the shower and hit his head in the same spot he’d had a previous concussion. He didn’t remember anything, even his mom. I don’t know if he still has amnesia. But last I heard he did. She still hangs out with him and when I talked to her about everything recently, she said well he doesn’t even remember now so it doesn’t matter.   I’ve been contemplating everything and I’ve just started not talking to her as much. I haven’t tried making plans. I’m still just very hurt that she would want to be friends with him so bad after what he did. And before anyone mentions it, she’s not dating him. She’s not into dating rn. She just wants to enjoy college. AITA for distancing myself from her?\n",
      "For context, I (15 F) sit next to two people during math class (Fake names) Emma (15F) and Jacob (15M), Emma is dating Jacob and constantly brags abouy how she has a boyfriend and I don't (I'm not even into guys). I have always sucked at math and I like to joke about it to my friends, Jacob and I have alot in common and we have gotten pretty close lately.   During math we had a test and after we were done with it I made a joke to Jacob about how I'm so bad at math that I almost didn't pass 2nd grade (true story) and Emma just snapped at me. She started ranting about how I'm unfunny and annoying and even started to mimic me in a annoying high pitched voice. Jacob didn't say anything and just stayed quiet while Emma continued her rant, after she stopped I asked the teacher if I could go to the bathroom and I left. I knew I was about to cry so I rushed to a stall and stayed in there until I calmed myself down. I thought I was good to go back and class and thought nobody would notice that I cried but when I got back Emma just rolled her eyes and ignored me the rest of class. I have told this joke to her after times but I haven't told it to Jacob until now  She seems genuinely pissed at me, I know I can be annoying but I didn't think I was that annoying. Emma and I used to actually be pretty good friends until Jacob joined our class and I started being friends with both of them, so am I the asshole for making that joke?  Edit: for the people saying that she's jealous, she has nothing to be jealous of. She is prettier, smarter, and more talented than I could ever been so I don't think she's jealous\n",
      "I’m a junior in college and I ended up not going home for winter break because of the culmination of a lot of different events. Basically I started dating my boyfriend last year, and this year my parents asked to meet him. I told them that’s no problem, but he would only be able to be in town to meet them for 2 days and would not stay for Christmas. Originally they were okay with this and I thought all was well.   However, a week before we were set to leave my parents called me and asked if we could come later instead, so we could be there for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. I explained to them I’d be staying after my boyfriend left, but they told me my dad would be working the 2 days my boyfriend would be there and wouldn’t really be able to meet him. I felt bad, but there was nothing we could do, my boyfriend only has certain days off work and wanted to be home for Christmas eve and Christmas day to be with his kids (obviously).   They tried to compromise by asking us to try and exchange our plane tickets and they’d pay the difference, but we don’t have plane tickets because we are driving. My parents offered to pay for plane tickets, but my boyfriend cannot fly because he has PTSD from a helicopter crash he was in when he was in the Navy. I really tried to explain my side of the story, but my parents got really angry and accused me of not wanting to spend time with them and choosing my boyfriend over them.   They called my boyfriend a ton of names and called into question the nature of our relationship and I felt very disrespected. I ended up telling my parents I wasn’t going to be coming home because of how they were acting and that I didn’t want to make a cross country drive by myself (there were no more plane tickets reasonably priced by the time this happened).  I had a great Christmas with my boyfriend and his kids, but since then my parents have been very irate with me and my sister called me to tell me I was being a brat. Even my boyfriend said that maybe I should’ve just gone on my own to appease them. I feel like I may have handled the situation poorly, so AITA here?\n",
      "I’ve been with my fiancé for 4 years and we have just gotten a house together. I love him dearly but his sleeping habit make me want to put a pillow over his face. From the loud snoring, to the chokehold spooning, to his half awake ramblings that can range from waking me up for finding the death stairs to rambling about Jaguars in  a suitcase, I cannot sleep.   So to try to get me to sleep I listen to ASMR videos but he has complained that he can still hear it at 1% volume (btw are you fucking kidding me?)   So to combat the arguments this has caused I have decided to sleep in the spare room. And I actually like having the extra space to sleep, but he thinks I’m mad at him for sleeping somewhere else despite my numerous attempts to console his worries, I love him but I don’t think sleeping In the same bed means anything to our relationship. I just means I can get some sleep and have no resentment towards him for it.   I have asked friends and family members and they all tell me it’s a sign that the relationship is failing..how? I don’t understand it and now I’m treated like an arsehole for supposedly pushing him away...AITA here?\n",
      "A month ago someone posted in my cities subreddit about a dashcam turning left through a (green) light and a pedestrian jaywalked in front of the car, but didn't look straight and walked right into a pole. I showed my husband and he confirms it is a man from our apartment building.  I kinda forgot about it but I saw the GIF in instant karma and it is getting a lot of traction  Would I be an asshole if next time I ran into him and told him the internet saw what he did because it was caught on a road cam or just let him live blissfully ignorant?\n",
      "On mobile, sorry for any errors or formatting issues.   TLDR at the bottom  So my (F 33) kids grandfather and grandmother (not related to me in any way just to the kids) just met myself and the kids about a year ago due to drama with the kids dad (I don’t want to get into here as it’s not really relevant to the story)   The Grandparents and I get along pretty good I think, and I absolutely adore my kids grandmother, however, their grandfather can be a bit… much sometimes, and can have some interesting opinions on things. Normally I don’t pay him much attention, however he does one thing that really gets on my nerves.   He gives nicknames. I know, I know what a first world problem right? The thing is I absolutely hate it. It would be one thing if it was “sweetie” or “hun”. If that were the case I would grin and bear it. But he doesn’t do that, he shortens names to give a whole new name. I shut him down the very first time he did it to me and told him I prefer to be called by my full first name. He slips once in a blue moon with my name, which is whatever. He always corrects himself and we move on like it didn’t happen.   That isn’t the true problem, the big problem is he also does it to my daughter. He does it every time we go visit, and I hate it with a passion. For example, it would be like I named my daughter Anastasia and he called her Allie (not the actual names). I hate it because if I wanted my daughter called Allie I would have named her Allie not Anastasia. I also am a firm believer that names are important and hold power and should be used properly.   So today while we were visiting he called her “Allie” again and I put my foot down and told him “grandpa we don’t use nicknames in our house, please call her Anastasia. If she wants a nickname when she’s older then that will be her choice, but until she can decide on her own I’d like it if you could call her by her name”  and he tells me “well when she gets to school she’ll get a nickname anyways, everyone does. She may as well get used to it now”  after this I just said “well while I’m her mother and she’s to young to decide for herself, I say no nicknames.” And I left it at that. But for the rest of the visit he was pretty short with me and was really emphasizing every syllable in my daughters name every time he said it.   We left shortly after, but now I’m wondering if I was TA? I feel like it’s a fair boundary to have.. but I could tell he was upset with me so now I’m not too sure if I was an AH.  So AITA?  TLDR: grandfather refuses to call my daughter by her full given name and only by a nickname and I shut it down and hurt his feelings  Edit 1. I was clear with him the very first time we met why I don’t like nicknames and that I’d prefer we don’t use them. He knows I hate them and has known from the very beginning  Edit 2. There is a cultural difference between us (He is white and I am not). my culture is also why names have such an importance to me, but I won’t lie, it is also because I really hate nicknames.   Edit 3. When my daughter is older (not just barely a toddler) if she wants a nickname I will 100% respect her choice in that as it is her name and she can be called whatever brings her joy  Edit 4.  Someone said I should mention he does not give nicknames to anyone else in the family, or even to his friends. Only to me and my daughter\n",
      "So, I’m a 30F with a short pixie style hair cut and I have been getting it maintained by the same barber for about two years. This barber is great. I have absolutely no problems with him. He is professional, personable, and always does a great job on my hair. We have a really good client/barber relationship, which is why what I’m about to ask makes me feel like the asshole.   He recently hired a new barber in his shop, and her Instagram has some really great hair cuts on it. I’ve been wanting to get an undercut as my hair grows out and she has featured some undercuts on her instagram. So I’ve been considering making an appointment with her instead of my usual barber.   WIBTA if I got my hair cut by her instead of my usual guy?\n",
      "My female 23 have a younger brother who is 18 who is graduating high school Saturday and I’m not sure I want to go.I want to go because a high school graduation is important and I want to be there to support him. But I feel like if I go I might start crying seeing that he got the happy graduation experience that I didn’t get.  My brother has always been my mothers favorite. She claims it’s because he doesn’t argue with her like I do and that he does what he’s told. To get on with the story I’ve heard all that my mom has planned for his graduation and how excited everyone is to go to his graduation and it kind of hurts to hear. She is going all out. Now this is where I might be the asshole for thinking a college graduation is a bigger deal than a high school one and that they should have planned something to celebrate with me more. For a little background I had my college graduation ceremony Mother’s Day weekend. To be blunt it was kind of depressing. I had to arrive by myself and see all the graduates walking in with their families. We could have come together but they didn’t see the point of it.  After the ceremony I went to meet with my family. Only my parents were there.The first thing my mother said to me was not congratulations on graduating. Instead it was your brother drank too much last night and we had to pullover while driving here so he could throw up. He is currently hungover and dying so he’s in the car.  After that explanation though my parents did congratulate me and even hugged me which I was kind of surprised about but grateful for. I asked them if we could take pictures in front of my schools mascot.  My dad said it’s too crowded and they have an appointment to make to get my mom's new car. My dad then asked if we can just come back on a different day to take them and my mom agreed since not everyone is there meaning my brother. So I put on a smile and said that’s fine we don’t have to take pictures here. They both smiled and hugged me then left.   As I was walking to my car I saw all my fellow graduates smiling with their families taking pictures. I was halfway to my car when my mom called me to come back and take pictures. I won’t lie I started tearing up because I was so happy they decided to come back to take pictures with me. My mother said she knew if we didn’t take the pictures today we would never come back and take them.  My mom told me to pick a place for dinner.Unfortunately no restaurant had any available tables we ended up doing for my graduation dinner was ordering cheesecake to be picked up and they ordered me a pizza. I know I shouldn’t feel entailed to expect things from them but I thought the day would be more exciting. It didn't even feel like much of an accomplishment. It just felt like no one put much thought into anything.  So would I be the asshole if I didn’t go to my brothers graduation?\n",
      "My fiance(32m) and I(31f) are getting married in October out of state. We decided to only invite our immediate families with no bridal parties (no bridesmaids, no groomsmen).  After deciding the colors for our wedding, we asked all members of both our families if they could wear outfits that match those colors. I realize this is unusual, asking guests to wear certain colors to our wedding, but everyone was receptive of our concept and request.  Cut to 2 weeks ago, my FMIL and one of my FSIL's invite me to go with them to pick up their dresses. We go to big brand wedding store (DB) and they get their dresses, I'm happy to see the colors are perfect. However, they are all the same dress. Same style, same cut...same dress. I can't help in feeling that my FMIL is trying to \"be a bridesmaid\" with her daughters by buying the same dresses for all three of them and especially since I will not be having any bridesmaids.  I know I have already picked my battle about having a color preference for outfits worn to our wedding and have come to terms with them wearing the dresses, but who wears the same dresses to a wedding if you're not bridesmaids??  Reddit, AITA for feeling slighted by my FMIL??\n",
      "[Repost, i accidentally deleted] I'm super torn over this.  I (f17) have an older half sister Miya (f20) i didn't grew up with her but we usually get along pretty well, she is really nice and charming.  A thing about Miya is that her mom put her on beauty contests and got her into modeling since she was a child, she also grew up in Korea so beauty standards are pretty high and her looks are super important for her.  She has been staying with us lately and i've noticed a few things. She always has a stomach ache so she can't eat, says she already ate or eats in her room. She talks a lot and plays with her food when she does eat with us and i've heard her throwing up after eating a few times. This has been going on for months.  I confronted her about it and she denied it but then those things didn't seem to change. I tried to talk to her again and she denied it, saying i had nothing to worry about. The third time i did it she was really rude to me and told me to mind my business.  I talked with my younger sister (15) and she is also worried about it. Its also not the first time i've been suspicious, this comes from when she was a teenager.  After the third time, i decided to talk to my parents. My mom honestly doesn't care about her but my dad got really mad at her, they had a huge fight. Now Miya is really mad at me, she said that she understood why i did it but that whatever she does is not my problem, we had a fight over it and she is now not talking to me and trying to avoid me. I feel super guilty over it.  Am i the asshole?\n",
      "Let me preface this with saying that I have no problem with people who are overweight. It's not necessarily someone's fault for being overweight, as I know that thyroid problems, PCOS, medications, physical disabilities, etc. can cause weight gain and make it difficult to lose weight.  Now, I live in an apartment complex where every hour (24/7) is quiet hour. The person who lives above me is very overweight (450+ lbs) and makes loud stomping sounds all the time when they walk. It literally causes things on my apartment walls to  shake , and it's been going on ever since he moved in a few months ago.  Would I be the asshole for talking to the guy about his stomping sounds? I mean, I don't think he can help it because he is overweight, so I don't know what I could do about it. Also, would I be the asshole if I complained to my apartment management team about this? I know he doesn't mean to stomp, but it is REALLY LOUD and, as I said, makes things shake.\n",
      "My ex and I dated/lived with each other for almost 4 years. Long story short, things ended on not such a good note but we wanted to keep things civil.  Most of everything was either hers or mine but there were a few things we bought together that we let each other have if we wanted it to make things easier. After she moved out I told her I would keep a few things since where she was moving was such a tiny place. I asked her if she wanted it the TV and she said “If you still have it by the time i move again i can take it off your hands.” I agreed.   One month after we broke up she is already with someone else. One month. Along with my disdain toward her I was already fed up with holding on to her shit. In my head I thought “I’m not a storage unit why should I keep it for your convenience?” so one day i packed up a lot of it and hauled to her house. She was not very pleased but at the time I could of cared less. We didn’t speak for months. During this time my sister mentioned to me that her  TV was busted so I offered her the extra one I had, “Fuck it..it’s my TV anyway.” I thought. This was in December.   Flash forward to today. Since then my ex and I have made amends, her bf dumped her, blah blah. She is moving next month and asked about the little things I might have that belongs to her. She asked about the TV so I explained why I don’t have it. Now she is guilt tripping me by saying that she won’t have one at all when she moves.  A side note: she will be in a big city with a very good paying job. They offered her a lot of money for a relocating fee. IMO she can buy a new, better,  bigger TV.\n",
      "For backstory purposes my girlfriend (f20) and I (m21) have been dating for about 5 months now. We talk on the phone almost every night around 9:30-10 PM. She has trouble falling asleep and sometimes asks me to talk to her until she falls asleep. I typically say no because I don’t feel like talking much at night and I’m tired. She typically accepts it and just stays on the phone until I fall asleep around 11 and then she hangs up.  Last night I went to do homework with her as we are both in college. I told her when we left around 8:30 that I would be playing video games with my friends. She didn’t have a problem with it and we went our separate ways. After about 2 hours she called me and I declined it because I was still on with my friends. She called me again an hour later and I declined it again. She texted me telling me that she wanted to talk to me tonight and to let her know when I was done. Around 1 I got another call which I answered.  She asked if I was still on with my friends and I told her yes. She seemed a little upset but didn’t push the subject. I stayed on the phone with her while playing and put her on mute so she wouldn’t be bothered by any of the noise that I was making. She stayed quiet the whole time which is unlike her but I didn’t think anything of it. After I had gotten off around 1:30 AM I started talking to her but her answers were short. I asked if she was ok and she said she was but then asked if I talked to my friends the whole time. I told her yes, and she said ok but didn’t say much else after. I ended up falling asleep a few minutes later. This morning she didn’t seem mad but she seemed less talkative than usual. I think I upset her last night but when I asked her this morning she said it’s ok and that it doesn’t matter. AITA?\n",
      "I'll try to keep it short. I (37f) am an American working abroad with my husband (37m). We work at the same institution with close to a hundred other Americans, and this so far has been the easiest way to make friends (we do have a few local friends as well). Company housing is all clustered together and there's a big emphasis on community, with most of the other people we work with being families with kids in the 30-50 age range, which renders my husband and I as outliers as the oldest childless couple by 5 or so years. We're closest friends with another couple whom we worked with before, who are about 35 with four kids under 7, and a single woman whom we also worked with alongside this couple who is 27.  We're perfectly happy to hang out with the couple with kids on their own, but admittedly, it often becomes all about managing the kids who are running around and screaming, which is not something I blame the parents for since four kids is a lot. Whenever there is a children's birthday party, we pass; everyone is mostly interested in talking about their kids, and the noise is headache-inducing. My friend who is the mom of the four has told me that she gets why I don't go and that I'm never under any obligation to attend one of her children's parties. However, there was such a party yesterday, and the 27 year old friend told me it isn't fair that I don't go to the parties and she does since all the parents could use the extra help. I also had one of my supervisors tell me after the last children's party that I didn't attend that I need to be better integrated into the community. Interestingly, nobody says this stuff to my husband, who is actually really great with kids, whereas I literally don't know how to properly hold a baby (I admit I should learn).  Am I the asshole here?  Edit: a couple typos.\n",
      "It's not illegal to smoke on the balcony but this is weed so that's a grey area.... Additionally, I try my best to stay as far away from her window as possible when I'm on the balcony...AITA for thinking that I'm justified smoking whatever I want on the balcony?\n",
      "So my boss and I are a 2-man team. There is a big client that keeps supplying my boss with projects and that's how we work. All our work is done on the computer. My boss is renting an apartment that we use as an office, there's a couple of desks there for us and 2 computers, one for each of us.  I used to work full time at the office but since about a year ago we agreed that I'd work most days from home due to the long commute and we'd only meet once a week or two when we need to discuss a new project or something. So now I go to the office only few days a month, but when I do I spend the whole day there working on my computer.   My boss has 2 kids (5 and 8 years old) who come to the office sometimes, lately they started to come more than usual. They are a bit annoying when they are in the office because, you know, kids, but he gives them a tablet and that keeps them busy, so it's all good.  When they come while I'm not at the office tho, he lets them use my computer to watch cartoons and stuff. I used to hate that because I fear they might mess with some of the files or the applications I use but they only watch cartoons so it was ok. What's not OK tho is that they make a mess around the desk, they move the monitor and drop the headphones (I'm a bit OCD), they eat snacks and drop little bits everywhere, this time I found some sticky liquid all over the desk which I guess was something sweet they were eating. Sometimes I give the chair and desk a quick wipe but this time I had to use multiple wet tissues and spent like 15 mins cleaning the desk and sweeping the floor around it.  WIBTA if I ask my boss to disallow his kids from using my computer, and keeps them busy with something else, even tho I only go there and use it few days a month?  My boss is a good, humble guy. He has no problem ordering food for me and sometimes he even prepares some fruits and brings them to me while I'm working. This thing annoys me a lot but I don't want to sound rude to my boss or entitled and ungrateful. Should I just suck it up?  PS. When I said \"my computer\" I meant the computer assigned to me at the office, it's not owned by me.\n",
      "Ok, so. There's this kid named, let say mark. (not real name) When he was young, he got a brain tumor. Luckily, he was able to have it removed, with minor complications. But he still was NOT the same person after. Keep in mind I only knew him after he had it removed. He didn't understand that he couldn't do certain things and didn't understand social cues either. With that out of the way, in around 1st or 2nd grade, I started to be friends with him. He was a nice kid, and I tried to understand him. So that friendship happened until about 4th grade. Around that time, Mark started taking MY things and putting them in his MOUTH. Of course, without asking. I told him to stop MULTIPLE times, but he never did. He also just generally bothered me even with me telling him to stop many times. So, I stopped being his friend. I feel ableist for doing this, and I don't know if I made the right choice.  It's a bit short, but, AITA?\n",
      "So for context this is about covid but could apply to almost any other disease such as an STD or something, which i feel is important to mention because i don’t think it violates the rules.  About three weeks ago i (19f) helped my brother (19m) move into his apartment at university. On thursday he texted my family group chat to tell us he recently found out he had covid. I got a little paranoid and cancelled plans with my boyfriend (20m) because i wanted to freak out by myself / with my family. I told him what happened because he asked and I didn’t want to lie. I also told him I wanted to get myself tested because finding out my brother had it freaked me out a little (NOTE: i do not think i that i would’ve have gotten it from my brother or that we would have gotten it from the same person, i just wanted to be safe). He told me he refused to see me until i got a negative test result because his mom was worried about me infecting him (her being controlling is a whole separate issue). I got tested and it came back negative. I told him this and my friend brought up the point that he’s been working for uber so maybe he should get tested to. I told my boyfriend that i think it would be a good idea for him to get tested too, but did not make the condition that I won’t see him until he gets tested and gets the results like he told me. He got very mad at me and said he hasn’t been exposed to anyone with covid and i’m being unreasonable and between the two of us i’d be more likely to get it anyway since i’m less cautious than he is (um what). He also said he didn’t want to see me for a while because he’s mad at me for asking that. I don’t think i’m the AH, but he clearly does and so does his mom. I just want to know if i’m an AH for asking him to get tested and implying that he might have it?  side note: he also refuses bc he said he got tested two months ago and won’t do it again. I also got tested two months ago bc i had a surgery and had to be confirmed negative before the procedure.   EDIT: i was fine with getting tested, it was my idea, and i totally get him being cautious, but the issues started when he refused to get tested too.  TL;DR my boyfriend demanded i get covid tested because my brother (who doesn’t live with me) has it and said he won’t see me until i do. Then got mad when i asked him to get tested to.\n",
      "UPDATE: didn’t go lol I just bought candy and handed it out which was a dumb move bc I only had 3 trick or treaters. It was so dead and boring lol I’m going next year at 23 idc this was the biggest waste of time   I'm old af, I know lol. I'm off work today and my 16 year old sister is going trick or treating with her friends, and I can't convince my friends to go trick or treating with me. I'm pretty cool with her friends so I thought I'd join them, they don't mind and are okay with me coming, because I haven't went since I finished highschool and kinda miss it and want to relive that childhood experience. By the way, this isn't an attempt at getting free candy or something, I could care less, I'm actually on a keto diet so it's not like I can even eat it, I was thinking of donating it anyways. I just want the experience and wanna do it for the fun of it. (I don't like halloween parties btw) So, AITA for going trick or treating amongst a bunch of 12 year olds?\n",
      "So one of my friends Brittany decided to have a weekend getaway for her 30th birthday . 11 of us split the cost of a rental, long story short there were issues with our stay and she received a full refund on her credit card the following month.   Brittany asked us if she could pay us all back later as they did not expect having to refund anyone and that instead of putting the cash we all paid her for the rental on their credit card they had spent it.   Most of us agreed and were understanding. A few of the girls torched their relationship with her over the request for an extension but the majority remained patient.   This wasn’t a minuscule amount of money. All together Brittany received over 3.5k refund.   This is where it gets extra uncomfortable. Come December I had already written the refund off and that I wasn’t going to ever see that money again.. but she sends out a lengthy text explaining how it was her husbands fault and that she wouldn’t do that to us and ultimately guilt tripping (gaslighting) anyone who felt negative feelings about not receiving the refund. She asked anyone who hadn’t received the refund to text her and that he would pay everyone on the 15th. She completely threw her husband under the bus. Not to mention I am not sure but I speculate no one had been paid and this text felt very manipulative.   So I texted her to let her know I hadn’t received it, she said he would send it asap. December 30th I asked her if he had sent it she said that he forgot and would send it January 1st and if not then, February. Jan 1st- nothing. She then sends another text a few weeks later asking if I’d like her to go ahead and send the money for a mutual friend’s bachelorette party with the refund but I tell her no I am not collecting the money for the bachelorette yet that she could just send the refund. Nothing.   THEN she announces on social media her and her husband are taking a trip to EUROPE for TWO weeks. I’m so annoyed. February 1st passes and I messaged her on the 15th asking to be paid. Same rigamarole. She’s says I’ll get it the next day, nothing. I message her and ask her to remind her husband. She says that she would and then she gives me another date the 28th of February.   I don’t plan to let it go. I feel so manipulated and like a real friend wouldn’t behave this way. You can’t steal over 3.5k of other peoples money and expect them to be ok with it.   So I’m asking AITA if I continue to ask or torch my relationship with her over this?   -side note she told me her husband didn’t feel anyone deserved the money back because it was her 30th birthday.\n",
      "My (17f) dad died when I was 8 and my brothers were 5 and 4. Our mom remarried when I was 11 and she has two more kids now, our half siblings. When our dad found out our mom was pregnant with each of us he created these books, one for each of us, where he documented our lives and his thoughts on us. He called them our life books and he had so much stuff in there!! Even doodles lol. And he died before he could really do everything with them that he wanted to, so I decided to continue them for my brother. I would write stuff in there, talk about how dad would have felt, say how proud I was, talk about the milestones in their lives. My brothers love knowing I do it for them though they haven't read them yet. Both want to wait.  My stepdad knows about these and was upset that I never started them for my half siblings. When he first brought it up to me six years ago, when my mom was pregnant with my first half sister, he said it would be a sweet thing to make her feel like part of the sibling group. I told him I wasn't her parent. I was only doing my brothers because our dad couldn't and he should start one for his daughter if he wanted. It came up again with my second half sister and he was a bit more of a dick about it saying maybe the books should be stopped since he was their dad now and it should be his thoughts and not our dads that matter.  My mom was also a little upset I didn't do it for my half sisters but mostly because I think she knows deep down I am closer to my  brothers and feel more bonded and connected with them. But anyway, the other night I was showing my brothers my life book and they were asking me about doing it for them and my half sisters overheard, asked about theirs, and got upset. Which led my mom and stepdad (please, please, when you respond, please don't call him my dad because I do not consider him a dad to me) to telling me I was being really unfair to them. He said I was a bully who excludes people. My mom said she never wanted to say much but how did I not think the truth would hurt them eventually. I just feel like I'm stuck in crazy town because doesn't it make sense for me to want to continue this for my dad and my brothers? Does it not make sense why I don't do it for them?  AITA?\n",
      "My husband runs a shop dealing with electrical supplies (I mention the context because its not a shop the general public normally visit on passing). For the past 4 years there has been a woman, approx 40 years old, living a few doors down who comes into the shop and talks to him and sometimes his colleague for up to an hour sometimes. It's obvious she has some kind of mental disability and even if they ignore her she just didn't leave.  In the past couple of weeks I have been hired in place of my husbands colleagueand now help him run the shop. This woman doesn't like me, it is obvious, she will walk past the window and not come in if she sees me, she'll come in the shop if I'm downstairs and she doesn't think I'm in and then leave when I come upstairs muttering under her breath and scowling. My husband is incapable of being mean so won't say anything horrible to her but she really doesn't take the hint when I'm not there.  Today I nipped out to grab some milk and saw her watching me through her window, sure enough when I came back she was in the shop. She pushed past me muttering again and I got so cross I shut the door behind her with a bang. As we were leaving tonight it was raining and he was outside going through the neighbours bin, she shouted and waved goodbye to my husband and then when he took my arm to help me over the road (I'm heavily pregnant) she began to shout obscenities at me and throw her bin grubbings at me (she missed, not a very good shot).  Anyway her landlady is one of my husbands regular customers and account holder so AITA if I had a word with her landlady about her behaviour?  Edit  Landlady has already spoken to another tennant in the flats about moving her to the other set of flats due to other complaints. However it's in a rougher area and not as nice and she didn't want to be seen as being discriminatory toward a disabled person. She can do this as she is renovating her properties and was considering not letting her move back in because she wasn't going to accept dss anymore in that building only in her other property.  The police see her as harmless and don't want to escalate anything they already know her well. (we're in the UK and social services call to see her regularly)  I also don't mean to call the landlady specifically but just wondered if I should say something next time she came in the shop\n",
      "So Reddit, I need to settle a disagreement between my wife and I.  I feel I ATA for how I acted in the situation below, wife feels I was justified.  You tell me.  So I recently purchased some new outdoor equipment online with in-store pick up. The email I received tells me to go to customer service for pick up.  So I go into A’s sporting and outdoor store. (Fake name) to pick up my items, and as instructed, go straight to the customer service desk. Walking passed the 3 cashier lines that much be 10deep each. As I walk up the gentlemen currently engaged with customer service is just grabbing his bag, so as he move me away I slide right up to the counter and ask the lady behind the counter for help with my pick up order. Below is the conversation:  Me: Good morning, I’m here to pick up my order.  points to phone with order bar code up   Lady: uhhh sure but I’m actually helping the cashier line right now, didn’t you see the long lines over there?  Me: oh yah I did, do I need to wait through a cashier line first?  Lady: No they can’t help you, only customer service can.  Me: Great, here is my code.  Lady: I said I was helping the cashier line sir, your going to have to wait.   at this point I was a little stunned at the stupidity, confused, and annoyed. So I step aside to let her do her thing   After customer service lady calls 5-6people from the cashier line and helps them, she then waves me over.  Lady: ok sir, how can I help you.  Me: hands her bar code  im pissed off st this point   Lady scans code, and with out moving and inch from her place, leans under the cash register and hands me my items in under 5 seconds from me walking back up.  Lady: here you go sir  At this point I see a manager walking behind the count of customer service. (They are well marked from hourly employees)  So I raise my voice a bit and say:  “Really? You made me wait in line behind 5-6customer at the cashier lines rather than help me, even though your the only one that can help me? And it was right there? WTH lady? “  I say this while staring the manager right in the eyes then walk off. As I walk away I can hear the manager coaching the customer service lady that what she did was not company policy.  So…. AITA?  Edit: Just wanted to add some info from the comments.  1: seems likes it’s fairly split 50/50 for YTA/NTA, which didn’t help my wife or I win the argument, so thank you for the good laugh we enjoyed.  2:Some if the comments are pretty interesting and make some wild leaping assumptions. But the most common ones from comments/DMs are:  2a: “raising my voice a bit” is not equal to “shouting, yelling, screaming, berating, hollering, or anything else” there is a very wide range of decibels from a normal pleasant tone to yelling, maybe some people should try them?  2b: Assuming the lady was instructed to take cashier line first isn’t a horrible idea, but the fact that as I’m walking away the manager scolded her for doing so when he didn’t have to (since I was leaving) I’m betting this wasn’t the case. But I could be wrong, I suspect we have all had a boss lie before.  2C: last one specifically for some DM and slightly for some comments. Please learn to read, good lord no wonder the world is going to hell in a hand basket. I did not hit this lady, did not try to come over the counter, or refuse to pay for the items. (Yes all of these were mentioned to me) how do you people survive daily if you can’t read and understand simple text?  3: really appreciated some of the back and forth conversation in comments so thanks all!!\n",
      "There is this guy - i really like him (now) but in comparison to me he just is not very intelligent. When we got to know each other we had nothing to talk about and i have to admit i didnt expected i would ever want to listen to him. A few weeks later i met him again on a party (when both of us were high). We had a great time and evenfually started smoking together sometimes. Now my girlfriend is telling me i behave like an Asshole and dont respect him as a human beeing.\n",
      "Okay so this is a lot to take in... I did something I never thought I would today.  My friend is 18 year old gay male. We both just graduated high school. I am straight, but I’m sure some of you will say I am jealous anyway. I recently caught my friend being intimate with a 56 year old man. He didn’t know but I saw them in the mans house. I know this guy, he has a wife and 2 little kids (we love in a fairly small town) Now this isn’t an illegal relationship per say, but I definitely think it is an immoral one. My friend has struggled with depression and other stuff I don’t really understand but it makes him easy to manipulate (I know this because of the actions of some of our classmates). Needless to say I am worried about him. I attempted to talk to him about if he got any romantic interests and he denied it. Finally I got him to admit that he was seeing someone, but he wouldn’t tell me who. I didn’t need an answer cause he hangs around that guys neighbourhood everyday.  So this is the part where I really feel like I sacrificed my integrity. Long story short I anonymously contacted the man through a gay hook up app, and told him that I know who he is, and what he’s doing with my friend, and that if he didn’t stop seeing him immediately I would expose his profile to his wife. So, blackmail. I don’t think it’s illegal because I didn’t ask for money or anything of value but still pretty low none the less. Of course this guy is scum. I don’t regret what I did to him.  I regret not confronting my friend first. The next day he was visibly very upset, and wouldn’t tell me why. I also feel very bad for this mans lovely wife and kids. I am almost tempted to tell them anyway. It’s none of my business but it’s just feels so wrong to me. I hate people who cheat on those they are supposed to love. I think that while I am a bit of an ass what I did was for the greater good. What do you guys think?\n",
      "Son I (13m) share a room with my two sisters 17f, 19f.  We have two dogs that sleep in our room or on my 19 yo sisters bed the dog I own is only a couple months old because I got it as a Christmas gift from my mom and the other is 5 years old and we got it when we moved in our house.   My dog chews up our stuffed toys and little stuff we leave on the floor and my sister(19f) has stuffed mini toys that gets chewed up and result in our floor being full of fluff but she refuses to do anything until ive trained my dog I told her to keep stuff on her head board or shelves but she throws stuff on the floor and leaves it there.   Today my sister(17f) complained about the fluff and I decided to clean it but I told them to also help because they blame everything on my dog and don't want to help clean our room even if it's just there trash they leave on the floor like bottle paper and pens.   My big sister said that she didn't to that and that her mental illnesses did it and them my other sister had a argument with her about cleaning it. My big sister said that it wasn't that easy and she wouldn't understand I sided with my sister rather than my big sister so then she stormed off an hour early to work.   Me and my sister don't wanna say she is using her mental problems and an excuse but we feel like there is a certain point when she's using that excuse on every single thing that upsets us.\n",
      "Just from reading the title, of course I'm not the asshole when it comes to my racist grandparents. I'm not worried about what my grandparents think, I care more about whether or not I've been a dick to my parents. My mom and dad have always raised me and my siblings to believe that it's a person's character alone that determines their worth. They taught me that differences between cultures are meant to be enjoyed and celebrated, even though they're both white they themselves were from completely different cultures and barely spoke each others' language when they first met. They also taught me to respect my elders and even if I didn't agree, to show respect to the opinion of people who have lived more of life than me.  &#x200B;  My grandparents came to visit for this last week and me and my one brother went back to our hometown to see them. I've heard both grandparents say anti black and anti \"colored\" (basically anyone not black or white) statements this week. Every time it happens I have made eye contact with one of my parents and they just shook their head, basically telling me it's not worth the argument to say anything.  My brother is in a relationship with a black woman, however it was never mentioned or came up during the week. I'm in a relationship with a Hispanic man and being Friday he was finally able to visit today.  &#x200B;  When I introduced him to my grandparents, my grandfather asked his last name and my grandpa was visibly upset when he heard the obviously Spanish last name. They have basically just not been speaking to us for the last 10 or so hours, but I have used this time to speak solely Spanish to my partner who is a native speaker, and my parents and brother who all know basic Spanish for work. We're all from a different country so the language spoken at home in normally a western European language with some English mixed in. My mom just told me to cut it out with the Spanish because it's putting her and my dad in an awkward position with my dad's parents. I don't want to stop. But I might be the asshole for slightly punishing my parents and putting them in an awkward position when my grandparents are really the ones I want to single out for their closed minded views. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "I'm 16 ( as of yesterday ) and have shared a room with my mother ( 45 ) for my whole life ( and my little sister ( 5 ) for 5 years ) . Before I start I wanna say that my sister is brought to bed from 10pm - 2am ( yes my mom lets her stay up untill 2 and it pisses me off cause thats horrible for her but thats for a different day ) cause of school and my mom lays down with her untill she passes out , normally my sister has a semi difficult time falling asleep but recently it's been worse , Something else to consider is since we live in a older house our door is broken and is really loud when opened so whenever I go into the room it's a loud thud ( getting it unstuck ) and a long and loud squeak followed by the floor boards being loud af too  . With that being said lemme say why I might the asshole , so whenever I need to get into the bedroom when my mom is putting my sis to sleep I  get met with her sucking her teeth loudly at me and either getting told off then and their or getting told off afterwards immediately and normally I just put up with it cause I get it and i hate confrontation but it's also my room , recently I've had enough courage to tell her that it's my room to , tonight she kept calling me ignorant and left the room while she was putting my sister to sleep which left me with a whaling 5 year old but since I'm used to having to be the one to calm her down when my mom / brothers r being dicks I instantly walked over and put her to bed myself , I'm still in the same room of what happened in the story above and I'm nervous to be around my mom cause Im just tired of everything I do around her she dislikes ending up getting yelled at and this time not even doing anything worth yelling at ! Am I the asshole?  Edit : I also wanna say that I did let her know that I will be coming back into the room and I let her know that 80% of the time\n",

I'm actively taking antidepressants because of her and some other personal things.

      "It's often hard for me (30f) when it comes to feelings (autistic) and I often overreact (on the inside, I'm make sure it dose not show), I often get disapointed in friends when others wouldn't. This make me feel like AH often but I really can't stop the feelings and they are overwhelming. But this time i don't think my feelings are wrong but would apriciate help to be sure.  Almost 1,5 y ago we had baby number two at the same time as you know what happend. Well, my husbandet lost his jobb and I went on parental leave. He started studying and I stayed home with the kids. Between the two of us we have a lower income than I do on my own when I work and so it has been for 1,5 years now (couldn't go back to work beacuse of you know what) it's been hard. So i started work again one month ago and got my first paycheck (yey) but we have used up all our savings so I put away half my salary for emergansys (like car repare and things like that). Note that my friend know all of this.   My friend of 10 years and her family live down the road from us. My husband was friends with her bf for almost 15 years so we know them well. He got a great jobb, pays almost dubble what i make when I work and she make minimum because she is a student. They got two kids (4f and 8f). She is really good at a lot of things but not sewing so I help her out when she need to sew curtains and things lite that. They were going camping in their caravan and needed new curtains because it get to bright to early so the kids could't sleep. So i stayed upp 2 hours after bedtime to fix it for her (she asked the day before they went).  Two weeks later they come back home and me and the kids go over to hangout. The 8yo was away with her grandma to sell some old toys at a flea market to make som extra cash. My friend show me some item that the 8yo are going to sell the next day. One thing (there were like 15 items) was an unopend pack of dipers in my youngest size that she had marked with 1/3 of the original cost (dipers are extremly exspencive were we live). So I asked if I could by them for that price. She got all weird and said something like \"my kid think it's so much fun to sell... something somthing mumbeling... well mabey you could, I guess...give her money... mumbeling...\" so I stopped her suffering by shrugging and changeing the subject and we just talk for an other hour having a good time while the kids played and then went home.  It really make me sad that she so clearly did not want to sell them to me when she knows how we have had it over the past year after I just two weeks prior sew two pars of curtains for her for free (only the work, she bought the fabric). On the other hand now I'm making money again...   IATA for beeing hurt thinking that she could have sold them to me so that we could save more money even if it is just a little and just a pack of dipers?\n",

      "Apologies for format as I’m on mobile   My (27f) brother (19m) has been off and on with their boyfriend (24m), who I’ll call Kyle, for the last year. In this last year, on a nearly daily basis he’s called me to ask advice on how to handle/deal/talk with Kyle.   A few months ago he started talking about breaking up with Kyle and started looking for other guys to potentially date after they break up. Keep them ‘waiting in the wings’. For the last 3 months he’s hardly hung out with Kyle, had left his house early to hang out with other guys, and lied about where he was to his bf. He also started looking into his last ex boyfriend, but wasn’t able to find him.   Two weeks ago they broke up (again) and got back together the day after, with my brother telling me he DOES like Kyle, he actually loves him and he can see himself marrying him. He asked how I felt about them getting married, I said it’s up to them but after some pushing said maybe try waiting until they were together a year straight instead of constant breakups, and brought up breaking it off with the other guys. Three nights ago he told me he’s moving in with him, but he’s not going to put him on the lease. Kyle actually refused to put him on the lease when it was brought up.   Originally I didn’t say anything but he kept pestering me for my opinion on him moving in with Kyle. Eventually I asked if he thought it was a good idea since they just broke up, and said he should at least fight to be on the lease so he can’t just be kicked out. He reiterated he’s in love and that this would be cheaper than living alone, to which I brought up multiple of his friends offering him a room to be a roommate if that was the issue.  He blew up saying he’s his own person and I can’t dictate how he lives his life. I told him you’re absolutely right, but I don’t want you in a situation where he could legally kick you out and you’d have no where to go. He said just ‘because you think the world is bad, doesn’t mean everyone is’ and that ‘he’s in love’ and is ‘gonna marry this guy.’ I said, that’s great but if you’re talking about love and marriage maybe it’s time to take the other guys off the back burner and grow up. He cursed me out and hung up and hasn’t talked to me since, but mutual friends have told me I overstepped and should just be happy for him.  So, AITA?\n",

He wants Nyla to pick Tiara up from school instead of me during his custody time, he no longer wants to do joint birthday parties, no longer helps me financially other than what’s required or expenses that are as he says “directly going to Tiara”, I also can only call to speak to her during specific times of the day which is bizarre because we never operated like that. Now he won’t even speak to me on the phone, everything is through an app (he requested this in court).   When Tiara is in their care she never wants to speak to me and is always sad to come to my home. They are alienating her from me and it’s not fair. She’s always so happy to speak to them or go to their house. Most recently she had a breakdown on a video call begging not to talk to me. After that I lost it. He planned a vacation which runs over into some of my custody days. I told him to reschedule, he asked me why I was doing this but I refuse to continue to allow him to manipulate me and turn my child against me. He said its non refundable and I already agreed so it’s not fair but I said my daughter not wanting to be around me isn’t fair. He told me from now on to not ask him to be flexible with my schedule anymore and to only contact him for emergencies or to speak to my daughter. My mom said I’m being dramatic and causing more drama but my friends think I’m right. So AITA if I don’t let her go the day he scheduled for them to go? He says he’s going to have to go for a few days, come back for her, then go back so it’s not like she’ll miss out completely.  ETA: he filed a motion in court for my daughter to get a therapist because he claimed I’m being “emotionally abusive” towards her and that’s why she does not want to speak to me. They won’t do anything about the alienation because they said based on my actions IM somehow alienating him.\n",
      "My mum and I are having a joint birthday party in a few days (she's just turned 60 and I'm turning 30).   Finances are very tight for my partner and me as we have a young child and despite me working as well, nursery costs a lot! Due to this my mum kindly offered to pay for it all. I would have been happy with something low key, but she wanted to hire a local club, have a DJ and put on food. I have always been so grateful for her going to all this effort. Even though it was meant to be a joint party, I was happy to go along with her tastes for everything as she is paying.  A few days ago my partner's brother messaged the Facebook invite group to ask if his children could come for a couple of hours (party starts at 7pm so they will probably be gone by 9pm). I said yes with out giving it much thought, because 3 children out of 50/60 adults is not a big deal (in my opinion, and they are really well behaved).  However, my mum has just called me and was really angry that I had agreed this and that she wants me to cancel their invite stating that \"it's an adult party.\" I got really upset, because I already felt like my birthday has been steamrolled and this is the only thing I have asked for. She then threw the \"I've paid for everything\" card in my face.  I reacted by saying that if I have to un-invite them, then I'm not coming and I will cancel everyone from my side going. I then hung up because I felt so angry.   So AITA?\n",
      "So I have this friend (let's call him MK). About 4 weeks ago, MK decided he wants to go with me to see a particular band, so MK went ahead and bought us both tickets for the concert. Not wanting to be an asshole, I quickly paid MK for my ticket (about $150 total).  Fast forward to last night...MK comes over to my place to chill before we decide to go out for dinner. We head out to dinner and everything seems o.k...until the alcohol starts flowing. It's important to mention that I've struggled with drugs and alcohol-use problems in the past; but after a lot of hard work, I have managed to stay sober for the past 127 days. (It felt humbling and surreal to finally get my first 90-day sobriety chip). MK knows I don't drink or smoke anymore...but I'm also not the kinda guy to stop him from ordering a drink or two for himself.   After drinking his second mixed drink, MK starts getting...bold. MK starts off innocently enough--taking about why he (MK) is the best friend I could ask for and how if I lost him as a friend, I should be devestated (but not the other way around) because MK has \"so many more good friends than you, OP.\" Now, after his third drink, MK is getting a tad louder and angrier than usual. I have spent my fair share of time around the inebriated and learned it generally a good idea not to needlessly provoke them. So I just sit silently as he goes off ranting about everything: MK says I'm fat and mentally ill, MK thinks my parents are stupid for being religious (Christian), MK repeatedly makes fun of my brother (my brother left yesterday for a very long international program) and MK says he's \"glad [OP's bro] is gone...I'm better company for you anyways\".   Soon, MK decides to shit-talk my sobriety. MK says I'm \"no fun\" and that he \"will change that.\" He starts pressuring me to drink. When the server came around to check on us, MK started talking with the server about why I should order a few drinks and how I am \"too uptight.\" The server asks if I want a drink and I say no.  At this point, I'm getting pissed and I want to leave. On the way home (we drove together) MK straight-up tells me \"I will get you to drink with me again...I just need to bully you harder\" and starts laughing. I tell him he's a mean drunk and then I get out of the car to go to my place.  I realized this morning that we have plans to go to this concert in 2 weeks. I really do not want to go...especially if it will put my sobriety at risk. I am currently debating asking MK to give me back my money for the ticket and telling him I do not want to go with him (i.e. MK will then have 2 tickets). Normally I wouldn't make a big deal over finances, but I'm a recent college graduate thinking of going back for grad school...and $150 is like the price of a (cheap) textbook.  Would I be the asshole if I asked for the $150 back and said I didn't want to go to the concert?\n",
      "My girlfriend is moving in this October. I adore her and her daughter and we are already acting as a cohesive family unit. Today I told her that I was feeling a little nervous about the new situation and that I had worries just about everything will work out. You know, normal things that you worry about when you are moving in with someone and their child with myself assuming a step-parent like role. I am admittedly a worrywart and an overthinker and she is well aware of this. Her daughter is 5 and I’ve never lived with a child before. She is also bringing a cat, and I have two dogs who have never lived with cats before. There’s going to be a lot of new variables in my life, but I know what I was signing up for and I am incredibly excited to be living and growing with them. So I thought I was doing the healthy thing by expressing my nervousness and some of the worries that I had as we move forward. Basically I just want everyone to be happy and comfortable as we adjust to this big change.   She lost it on me and accused me of having one foot out the door. My nervousness and worries were actually doubt about our relationship. When she brought up NOT moving in I even responded with saying that it wasn’t what I want. I am so confused. Isn’t it normal to have some question marks/nervousness when you are moving in with someone? This is also super uncharacteristic of her. She is usually super level headed and will try to understand me no matter what, but every way I try to explain it it she retaliates with the doubt argument. But then again, maybe I was wrong? I mean I guess since we have been talking about it for months now, she would be upset that I was voicing this now?  AITA?  EDIT: She has very bad anxiety and probably PTSD from her marriage in which her child is from.\n",
      "My doggo has been putting a strain on my relationship. He is my emotional support dog (not a service dog) so he is very important to me and I can't function without him. She started hating him when we were going on vacation. He's a big dog but he's also my emotional support dog so I was able to have him sit next to me. My girlfriend didn't like this because she had to sit in a seat far from me. It was fine, we had a good trip. But, when we got back, she started telling all of our friends that my dog disrupted our trip and took up all my time. Ever since that she's treated him like dirt. We moved in together and she refuses to allow him on our furniture and makes me put him in a cage while we sleep. I was fine with it for a week. But, I'm very anti cage and he gets claustrophobic. We had an argument (it was mainly her yelling at me), I decided that no matter what she says I'm going to sleep with him. She didn't want him to be in the bed so I brought covers downstairs and I've been sleeping on the couch with him for a while now. I refuse to not allow him on the furniture, he doesn't pee and his hair gets everywhere no matter what because he's very fluffy. He's never peed inside or chewed on anything so I don't feel he should be punished. Last night, she came downstairs in tears and said I'm choosing the dog over her and that she's tired of it. She also said that there's fur everywhere and it's messing with her and she gets scared alone in our room.  She asked me to at least not allow him on the furniture and to sleep on the bed with her, I declined. He's my best friend and very important so I don't feel he should be treated like dirt. I'm only going back if he gets to sleep on the bed. Am I being unreasonable?  Edit: Thank you guys for the constructive criticism. One thing is, I get very bad panic attacks and I have bipolar disorder and depression. That's his whole point, to get me through all that. I can't distance myself from my dog because then I'll just deplete. There was a time where he was the only thing keeping me alive too. So, I think my bond with my dog isn't obsessive or anything, it's helpful. Honestly, if he were human and female, he'd be my girlfriend. There's no shame in that. But, I do understand better that this isn't suitable for my girlfriend and unfair.\n",
      "My narcissistic brother who I haven't spoken to in over half a year just had a baby with his gf. I met her once last year and she was very nice and kind like super duper sweet (perfect target for a narcissistic) , has her own place and a solid career. He only introduced us to her to show off that he was with a solid educated career woman as opposed to all of the other women he's dated. At one point last year I heard through my mom that they broke up and I asked her why and she said and I quote \"he said she was acting crazy and being too emotional\" I looked at her with a blank face and then she tried making excuses for him saying that its also because she wasn't supporting his goals and career and even if that's true, she has a right to choose a partner whose career and goals align with her own. Several months down the line he visited our house and announced that she was pregnant , I was shocked because I thought they had broken up and not to mention just a month or two before I caught glimpse of him swiping on Tinder. I congratulated him half heartedly and he was soaking up all the adoration from my mom and even the half assed congrats from me and my siblings seemed to suffice.  A few days after the big announcement from him, he overheard me and my family members talking shit about him and his inability to take responsibility for his behavior because his behavior is vindictive, he uses people to his advantage and plays victim and never aapologizes. He feels the world owes him something. He stormed in and cursed us all out and said we'd never meet his child. (Already weaponizing the baby) This coming from the man who never wanted kids and the man who physically tried to fight my mother and siblings on several occasions. Whose called us every name in the book for not praising his every achievement as a grown man but NEVER did the same for us, ever! I never spoke to him again.  And here we are, the baby is born. My mother has been in denial about the complication of this whole situation. Earlier she asked me to reach out to him and congratulate him because she's the only one doing it and I told her I dont have a relationship with him. I dont even have a relationship with his gf, I met her that one time and thats it. I mean Im happy for her, I have nothing against her or the baby and the baby is really precious but I have no responsibility to be in their life for \"appearances\" sake. My mom is in complete denial and its really draining. She just told me that my brother asked about why me and my siblings didn't visit and my mom tried to guilt me into going to visit the baby. I doubled down and told her that I dont have a relationship with him and Im not going to start having one just because he has a child now. She then went back to the guilting \"so if the baby comes here you're going to ignore the baby?! Wow!\" I said I wouldnt ignore the baby. She then said \"so you're not going to have a relationship with the baby?\" And I said \"no\" and she left. We are all grown adults.  I know he's going to come to our family home and bring that baby to force a conversation out of me and my siblings. I know he's going to use that child however he can. It's really sad because how can I ignore or show little affection to a baby???\n",
      "I love my mum but she’s a lot to handle. Ever since I can remember, I’ve always had a strained relationship with her.   After getting made redundant from my job, my mental health hasn’t been the best. I moved back with my parents and I’m already getting sick of living with them. However, I managed to find a new job and start next week.  To clear my head and switch off, I decided to book an impromptu solo holiday the week before I start. I’ve really been enjoying the time to myself.   My mum has been calling me every single day of my holiday and she’s really getting on my nerves. I was okay with the first phone call but her calling everyday is getting a bit much. If I don’t pick up, she’ll keep ringing. Yesterday she called and I was direct with her, saying that she doesn’t need to call me everyday and that I want to be alone but alas she’s still calling! Am I the asshole for me to want her to stop calling me on my holiday?\n",
      "So a little bit of context first,  We had 3 weeks to do like 5 assignements and like the good student I am I've done them all pretty fast and actually spent my time working instead of playing.   The assignement is due tomorrow and a friend of mine goes in my DMs and asks (as he always does) for the answers. I really hate giving out the answers to people that don't work because to my mind I worked on it and I've used my free-time to work so fuck you if you just play all day and not give a shit about school it's your fault if you have bad grades. I get it that you have difficulties in math or what not but dude you had almost an entire month to do it.  So I finally for once said no and told him my reasons. He then decided to insult me (which he does often and to everybody, he's pretty toxic) and when I asked him why he shouldn't work while I do, he told me that it was because his average mark is 0 (out of 20 (I don't know if the american or british system of grading is different from ours or not))  To be honest I really feel guilty about doing it because he's a relatively good friend but I just had enough of having to work and give out answers \"for free\". I don't know if I'm being an asshole towards him or if I just don't understand his motifs.  &#x200B;  TL;DR : I didn't give out the answers of the assignement we had a month to do and now I feel bad about it  Also sorry in advance for the poor grammar and sentence structure I'm not a native english speaker\n",
      "I recently found out I am pregnant. With triplets. The pregnancy is high risk. The dr and hospital are 4 hours away. From my little hometown. My Boyfriend of 2 yrs is in the Army and is gone right now. He doesn’t know any of this is going on. Stressed about the bills associated with this pregnancy. I decided to rent my home and live in a small apartment next to the hospital. When I found out there was a problem with the babies. I had 1 day to figure it all out. Since the drs needed to start more testing on the babies. My mom sent my brother to speak to me. He needed a place to live. I gave him a list of small chores to do as his deposit. Then told him he needed to transfer the utilities into his name. Before he could move in. I told him all of this in front of my mom. I typed up what I wanted on a online lease form along with the monthly amount he had to pay. He signed it. Handed my mom the keys. She said she would give them to him when it all was done. I found out that the day I left my brother and his family moved into my home.  He didn’t do what I had asked for the deposit. So I gave it a couple of days and called the utility company. They said he never transferred the utilities over. I called my brother today and asked him when he is going to transfer the utilities? His reply was “I quit my job” “ I got into a fight with my boss. I told him I can’t get up at 7 in the morning it’s too early”. Then he proceeded to tell me. He won’t transfer the utilities and That I can’t turn them off because it’s illegal. So I firmly told him. It’s in the lease. I will evict you.  All day I have been getting calls from my other brothers. Saying how selfish I am being. So I told them. I can’t afford to carry him. How about you pay his utilities?  Then tonight. I got a very angry message from my mom. Saying how selfish I am for not taking care of my brother. In his time of need. How he needs me to support him financially right now. How it’s unfair I own my own home and he doesn’t. She then said how it’s easy for me to work but he struggles with it. followed up at how rude I was for asking my other siblings to pay his bills. I have never ever had a panic attack. In my life but I had one today. I am thinking having him there might be too much for me while I am pregnant. AITA for giving him a 30 day notice? Then not allowing anyone to stay there until my boyfriend comes home and helps me.          UPDATE         *** OP’s New Husband here. I want to thank you all. Op’s brother is out of the house. Locks changed. I want to do a renovation. Add a bedroom off the master. For a nursery. Later a office. Op. Wants to rent. Use a management company. We are undecided right now. Op has a new phone. New number. I am still pissed. I won’t talk about the AH family. I need time. Op is heartbroken. Op has decided No family Contact. Until babies are born.\n",
      "I've (15M) started what we're calling a band with a friend (15M) and a younger sibling. We're all close as hell, but I've been slowly realising that maybe it's better I leave as: Since it's started, I've slowly started feeling like it's less of an  us  project and more  his  project.  I was really excited for the band at first, we liked the same stuff. It seemed cool. I started to learn guitar, we were planning it out. Meanwhile he was really starting to discover new bands he was into. Slipknot, Disturbed etc. I thought it was cool, even if the bands were a little dark for me. But I kept questioning whether I was being harsh, as I'd happily throw on some Get Scared and vibe.  Last year he kept quoting Slipknot in twisted ways that I will  never  forget due to something . He's okay now, safer and saner. But he's been really trying to get that sound in our band, which I've kept trying to explain by reasoning, number 1, my 12yo sibling is a part of this band, 2, heavy metal seems to affect my mental health.  We came up with a compromise. For all of 5 minutes. Then he was back on about a metal sound. I've been trying to protect my mental health, while trying to keep my friendship by going with it. He's not aware that the holiday incident is an issue, and were I to bring it up idk how he'd react.  I feel like leaving the band is my best bet as I've slowly descended through the band down to drummer, and I feel that everyone would be happier, as that way he can be metal as hell and I won't be bringing it down, and then I can go through stuff like normal.  TL;DR: tired teenage boy wondering whether he's wrong for wanting to leave the band after drastic sound change.  So... would I be in the wrong if I left? If y'all wanna know more just let me know and I'll try to explain. I'm sorry if it doesn't belong here\n",
      "2My roommate flew across the country today, and last night he asked if I could pick him up on Saturday at 11 am. I said I was pretty sure I can and he took that as a yes, which was all fine. Then today he texted me that he changed his return flight to get In at 9 pm instead of 11 am.   The airport is 30 mins from my house, so a bit over an hour round-trip, and it also happens to be right next to my work so I make the drive every weekday. When it was in the morning I didn't care cause I wasn't going to be doing anything on a Saturday morning anyway, but since it's now at night time, even though I don't necessarily have any plans yet I was hoping to do something that night with friends since it is my last Saturday before the semester starts up again. So if I told him I didn't want to pick him up and had him find someone else, WIBTA?  Edit: my other roommate was the one who took him to the airport this morning (I was actually out of town until just a bit ago so I saw him and told him my opinion and he called me a douche which prompted my post here)\n",
      "Wasn't sure how to title that but context is key yes? My family has this friend that is self employed (also gets SSI) and just does odd and end jobs for money. Driving people around, cleaning, etc.   We rely on her pretty heavily and have been since we moved into our own house over a year ago. (We don't have a car yet) At first things were fine, we pay her 5$ per trip unless its 3 or more stops, then we adjust as needed.   (Lately we've been giving her nearly 60-80 bucks a week, because I use her to get to work daily ((5 days a week)) + she's still used for other trips, the 5$ does add up fast)  Lately she's been paying way more attention to another friend who she claims gives her 150$ a week to be his main driver. Because of this, she is constantly unable to help us when we ask, and has even fallen through on PRE scheduled or agreed apon rides. For example today I have a doctors appointment that's been scheduled for over 2 weeks, she forgot to put it in her calendar and I forgot to remind her until the night before. Now her friend has an app before me and she's prioritizing him.  Are we the assholes for expecting too much or being mad when she doesn't help us? Is she the asshole for choosing him over us because he pays more?  We could always take ubers and taxis, we did before, they just cost more.  Edit: The trips are all less than 1 mile. Small city. We use her for grocery trips (which we do pay more if we are in the store longer, we value her time), doctor visits, etc.  Edit 2: Looks like ITAH, fair enough, I was expecting this when I wrote this out. Alot of you make valid points that she's gonna go where money is, id probably do the same in her shoes, so I shouldn't be as judgey over it. Its just super annoying to feel let down, but meh.  I also edited in that she gets SSI, not that it really changes the situation but these rides are not her only income, its side hussle money.  Edit 3: Got more specific on details, still doesn't really change anything though.\n",
      "We are currently in between places and staying with my husband's parents. MIL is not happy at all and locks herself in her bedroom whenever we are home, and i heard her joking on the phone about how FIL is getting her a gift as bribery because he was the one who wanted to let us stay. She pretty much has no relationship with my kids. I have three boys close in age and i truly don't think she could get all three of their names right, its that bad. the only contact we have is when she comes downstairs screaming because we let the kids make too much noise.  She gave us a schedule of when i can cook, so we won't be in the kitchen together, but FIL is sick and was sleeping a lot and not eating at his normal times, so we've run into each other a few times. MIL came downstairs last night to heat his food and my 12 year old asked her, mostly jokingly, if she loved him. She looked right at him and said \"I wouldn't say love\"  I told him that she can't love because no one loved her as a child, which is technically true (bizarre childhood, her dad had two families and when he mom died she was living in some unfinished guest house by herself at like 10) She just rolled her eyes, but FIL was feeling better today and cornered me in the kitchen and called me a bunch of names. He ended up in a screaming match with my husband and said he is never giving us a thing again (he put the down payment on the house) and called me some horrible names.\n",
      "Throwaway cause my school is on my main and some of my friends don’t know my past. Also so sorry for grammar I’m rush writing this.  I (F 21) have a rough relationship with my dad. I grew up in an abusive home and he didn’t do anything to really stop it until it turned around on him. We left when I was about 14. When we left he started dating a woman I will call “K”. K was a carbon copy of my mothers personality, which didn’t mesh well with me. Many times me and K would have explosive arguments that resulted in my father taking her side but telling me privately I was in the right but “I know how she is” so I should just be the bigger person.   Flash forward, I immediately moved out when I was 18. I moved in with my boyfriend and have been happy since because I cut contact with K completely. This obviously has upset my dad but he realized he couldn’t win so he gave up. Until recently. My college graduation is coming up soon and my dad asked if he could bring K. I immediately said no. He threw a temper tantrum saying I can’t shut her out of my life forever and that it’s hurting their feelings. I told him they had a chance to build a healthy relationship with me when I was a teenager. He’s now told my extended family and all of them are harping on me for “disrespectfully talking to my dad”. I need unbiased opinion, AITA?\n",
      "My mothers is an unforgiving person. I struggle with ED, depression and low self-esteem.  My brother is a mini version of her. He likes to argue and belittle me.  I decided I will visit my family and spend time with them. Everything was fine until I mentioned the winners of this year's Eurovision. My brother (who is 17) said that people like them disgust him, and that gays are pedouknowwhat, then compared them to very disguisting things. I support LGBTQ+ community (I am also bi-curious with will be important later), so I tried to use scientific arguments and teach him about sexuality, but he refused to listen to me and use the same arguments over and over. He was very disrespectful and mean- he was saying that gays are sick After 20 minutes of trying to make him realize he is hateful, and that this is offensive, he just said that this is his opinion. After showing him all of this different science articles and him just saying a few disgusting things over and over again, I was done. I said I won't talk to the homophobe and went to my old room. Where was my mother during this argument? Sitting on a sofa, listening but not participating, she didn't say anything to my brother.  Then mother came. She said that this is all my fault bc I'm the \"older one\" and should let my brother be bc \"he is just a teenager\". I said to her about my sexual confusion ( I am bi curious, but I have a boyfirend). Mother said that I should leave my boyfriend (she doesn't like him and takes every opportunity to try to convince me to break up with him) or at least kick him out of the flat, so I can \"experiment and live a little\". I said her I  can't do that. Then I talked to her about my issues with food and self-esteem. When she heard it, she told me to \"see a therapist, bc she won't visit me on the cemetery\". I broke when I heard this. Next day I came downstairs to apologize to my brother (yes he was disrespectful, but I  He apologized to, we hugged, everything was fine for about 30 seconds. Then mother asked me if I will tell my brother about the thing we were talking about (my sexuality). I said I'm not ready. Then she proceeded to talk about  everything I said to her at night. She was asking over and over, \"Am I a bad mother, what did I do wrong?\", then I said that I can't talk about it like this, but she insisted. So I told them that they are a little to judgmental (it was an understatement to say the least- they always talk bad about my appearance, intelligence, and everything I say or do). Then my brother started asking, \"When was I to rude? What are you talking about? You are just a crybaby!\"  I wasn't comfortable sharing my feelings, bc I know they would be mad at me and scream even more. I felt like a punching bag, so I just grabbed my things and walked to the door. My mother then said that I'm a disrespectful piece of sh!t, and she is paying for everything (which is not true)  Now we don't talk. AITA for trying to defend myself?\n",
      "This happened yesterday. Info for context.   Info : I (24m) hate smoking. My brother (B) 28m started smoking when he was 16. I didn't like him smoking, but I couldn't really do anything about it. My brother and I have a great relationship, never had any big fights and we've been discussing many things over the years, so I know what's going on with his life. Mother (M) 54 has been a smoker for at least 20 years, prior to her stopping instantly after a severe medical implication in 2019 (brain aneurysm).Father (F) 58 has been a smoker from his early 20s and is still smoking. After her surgery ,my mother turned a complete 180 to smoking and has tried several times to make my brother stop(tried for father as well ,but he won't stop). My brother has tried stopping it on his own ,but he always goes back to it. He is not a heavy smoker (a packet per week). He knows it's bad for him, but he says it is his decision and he enjoys it, which in the end I respect. He respects my boundaries as well (he doesn't smoke when I'm in his car as an example).   Story : My brother's birthday was yesterday and my mother wanted to gather a few relatives to celebrate. This time it would be about brother's birthday and him getting engaged the previous week . Brother was fine with that. The problem arose when my brother lit a cigarette after he got a beer to drink. Mother couldn't believe her eyes, since she wasn't informed that he has started smoking again. She tried to make him stop by pressuring his girlfriend. His girl tried at first, but she knew it was wrong and told him she never had an issue with his smoking and told him why she pressured him, and that was how I found out about it as well. Brother did not like that and said he'd discuss it with mother  seriously since she went far this time (hasn't happened yet). My brother talked with our mother about it and thankfully my mother did not make a fuss about it and said they'd discuss it again after the guests have left.  After a while we get to the presents. I decided to get him a zippo lighter. As a family thing, we open presents with the guests still there. My brother opens my gift, a zippo lighter with a nice pattern. His  reaction was incredible ,but when my mother saw it she flipped on me and said in front of everyone that I'm not thinking about the consequences of my gift, that I'll be the reason my brother will never stop smoking to \"honor\" the gift and things like that that sounded very strange to me. At first I wasn't sure what was happening, but as it turned out almost everyone agreed and said my gift would make my brother smoke more (not my father though ,who found that quite ridiculous). After that I left and went to my girlfriend's place, sent my brother a text to know where I'd be and I ignored a couple of calls from my mother.  I don't feel like an A but it really got to me. AITA here ?\n",
      "Basically the title says it all. Recently my girlfriend told me that her boss will tell her she has a fat ass and that it looks great and gave her the nickname thicky. Well obviously this made me uncomfortable and I told her so. And she told me she doesn’t care how it makes me feel. That it’s all in good fun and she likes the compliments. As well as my mom who was there during the conversation said I was also out of line for being upset. Am I the asshole not just for wanting her to tell him to stop but also for being mad that she said she didn’t care that it made me uncomfortable because it didn’t make her uncomfortable?  Edit: additional information is that she never tells anyone that she is in a relationship   Edit again: yes I am mad she won’t tell him to stop. But my main issue is that she told me she didn’t care how the situation made me feel. And that’s where I got the most upset   Final edit: even though it looks the decision is that I am nta. I did apologize for telling her to how the comments. But we did go over how she told me she didn’t care I was upset and uncomfortable and she saw that she was in the wrong there and apologized. Thank you for your input.   Edit: to all the people informing that my girlfriend is cheating on me. I know for a fact she is not. She doesn’t not talk about me or our relationship because she is hiding me and she doesn’t lie and say she’s single if someone ask. She’s just not the type of person to go out of their way to tell people. My phrasing in a prior edit was a bit mis leading\n",
      "In April, I was let go from a company I was employed with for over 15 years. To be honest, I hated the job, the company, and wanted to leave. This gave me the kick in the ass to do it (obviously...). It helped that I got a healthy severance package, and walked into a new job (that I love) quite quickly. I hold no ill-will to most of my former co-workers (really all but 3 out of a company of 700ish employees).   Earlier today, I received a text from a former coworker that I had a fairly decent working relationship with. They broke their company phone and my old phone (a newer iPhone with much life left in it) was being reassigned to them. They need my help to unlock it (I think it is still associated with my Apple ID?). I don’t particularly want to help a company that fired for what I, and many of my former coworkers, feel is a bullshit reason.   AITA for not helping?\n",
      "Ok, I know the title sounds awful but hear me out a little.  My nanny’s mother had heart surgery last Friday.  I knew my nanny (let’s call her M) was going to go see her mother to be with her.  I didn’t hear anything so I sent a text on Sunday to see how her mother was doing.  M let me know that her mom wasn’t doing well and that she would need days off.  She didn’t specify how many days but I didn’t want to bother her with details so I just said ok.  Yesterday I sent a text to let her know that we’ll sort it out for the week, take the time, and to let us know whenever she’s ready to come back.  I still haven’t heard a peep. Of course I want her to take her time and I don’t want her to be worried about her job, but I was hoping for at least some information on timing.  I don’t need details but getting a “hey I need a week off” would be so helpful!  My husband and I both work from home and have crazy schedules so having to shift things is a little challenging.  Granted, I know it doesn’t compare with dealing with an ill mother.  I want to support M but just need to know how long we’ll need to juggle things around for so we can plan too.\n",
      "So I was scrolling through Instagram, as ya do, and saw a story of someone who got extremely ill due to vaping. I discourage the use of vapes, after more and more news stories have come out about its effects. I made a decision to send this to my friend (who vapes), as we have had arguments about the health effects of vaping. The following ensued: Conversation. They felt that I was judging them, while I felt that I was trying to inform them and help them stay healthy now and in the future. AITA for sending them the story?  EDIT: Thanks for all (or most) of your responses so far! I did go back and apologize for my actions, which, after reading these responses, I understand make me a bit of an asshole. Cheers!\n",
      "So we are in the middle of this unrelenting heatwave and I’ve invited my sister to stay with me if need be. She hadn’t taken me up on the offer, wanted to wait and see how bad the heat would get, type of thing. So today was the day and she asked if she could stay over. She lives in an apartment without A/C and her landlord refuses to let her install a window unit even though she offered to pay him more towards the energy bill. I live in a house with a pool as well as a finished basement and it was agreed upon that she could sleep in the basement since I don’t have A/C either but the basement would be cooler. She is older than me (by 9 yrs) and has a few health issues related to her weight and she smokes as well. The problem started when today, she asked if she could stay with me as she couldn’t take the heat any longer. I told her “ Yes, however I would be hosting friends in a couple of days for a pool party”. She understood this meant that I didn’t want her hanging out with us and asked if she needed to make herself scarce. I told her that I could drive her back to her place that day and then come back for her afterwards. She proceeded to become agitated and asked if she embarrassed me. I told her to not make it about herself and that I really just wanted to be with alone with my friends. She said that she understood but “Never mind, I’ll just stay home”. I left it at that because I knew at this point she was angry. The thing is my friends are coming with their families. We all have young children and there will be 10 of us total. She doesn’t fit in with my friends.\n",
      "Edit: after reading some of the comments I talked with my sister to find out more and to see what she want and what she's comfortable with. She told me two guys slapped her, 1 apologized the other denies ever doing anything but she says he did it twice and he also tried to follow her home. She lives 4 blocks from the school so sometimes she walks home. She's 14 so she's afraid to express what she really wants. She's afraid of the social pressure because it seems like doing the right thing is the wrong thing to do. She's been bullied in middle school and when she spoke up nothing happen so she knows the feeling. But this shouldn't have to be the norm. Makes me sad to see some of the comments saying I should stay out of it because it might hurt her more. That's probably why it's so hard for people to call out their abuser.   Few days ago I(28M) found out my sister(14 freshman) was slap on butt by 2 other students(both freshman). I only found out about it because the school call my parents. She wasn't going to tell her coach but thankfully one of her teammate was there and witnessed it. She told my sister to tell the coach or else she would. My sister was hesitant to tell us because she was scared we would be mad at her, obviously we wouldn't. I'm not sure what has been done to them yet but I am determined to make sure they both get kicked off the football team. I believe that the football coach talked to the team and 1 of the student apologized but I feel like enough hasn't been done. I have a meeting with the school on Tuesday so we'll see what happens. But some people are telling me that I'm being an asshole for taking it too far to get them kicked off the team. I'm thinking that if nothing happens then nothing would change. So let me know WIBTA.\n",
      "So this conversation just happened between my mom (45f) and I(22f). I received a message from her asking if her and my aunt could use my car to take to Winchester Virginia (about 2 hours from where I live) to pick up their aunt, bring her to where I live for the day, and then back down to VA. It would be a total of 8 hours, 2 down, 2 back, and then repeated to drop their aunt back off. My mom has her own car, as does my aunt but my aunts car is in the shop because it broke down. I work weekends and work about 20 minutes from home.   My mom has a 2009 Ford Escape and it runs perfectly fine while I have a 2017 Ford Fusion I bought myself as I’ve been working since I was 16 that my dad co-signed for but I make all the payments and pay the insurance on. Even though it is my car my mom always comments about the miles that i put on my car but it’s my only transportation so I have to drive it when I go to work or on vacation (which I still have on planned for the last week in October to my bf’s moms in SC). They have taken my car before BUT without my permission to Erie Pa, and to Virginia to their cousins party (I also went but did not appreciate them taking my car).   My aunt is someone who likes materialistic things and I feel she just wants to show up in a nice car even though she is the same as my mom and likes to complain about the miles and everything with my car.   I said no already but my mom is making me feel guilty about saying no by giving me attitude because I said no. Since it is mine and my mom has nothing to do with the car I feel as though I shouldn’t have to let them use it. My boyfriend agrees with me but obviously my aunt is on my moms side.   So aita for not letting them take my car?\n",
      "Obligatory apologies as I'm on mobile and could have funky formatting or misspelled words. Also, this is my first ever post after lurking for ages.  I (F37) and my guy (M31) have been together for 7 months. At the end of 2020 we decided to move in together due to various factors. Living with him has been pretty awesome - he's attentive, spoils me, and in general ensures I live very comfortably in our shared space. Our one issue is his cats and their constant marking/spraying.  A little more background: between the two of us we have 5 cats. 3 are mine (19F, 4M, 4M - all fixed) and his 2 (1.5M, 2M - neither fixed). While the cats get along for the most part (aside from general cat disagreements) his two often take to biting and trying to mount mine, including my old lady who can barely walk half the time (and trust, she makes her displeasure known). On top of that his cats are spraying EVERYTHING. And I mean EVERY. SINGLE. THING. They've even gotten up onto the kitchen counters and sprayed the side of the fridge! The only place they are no longer allowed is our bathroom because at one point when the cats were first here they got into the closet and sprayed a ton of my clothes.  The smell is starting to get to me and I've had two breakdowns because I'll go and move/touch something and I find it covered in urine. He's apologetic and cleans up what we can see/find and has bought stuff to clean, but it's constant and I feel I can't unpack and organize my things for fear of his cats spraying it all.  And as I know someone will ask: My cats have never sprayed/marked anything. They were all fixed at the appropriate ages and I clean their litter boxes twice a day, even putting puppy pads down for my old lady who forgets how to use the litter box. I've only ever caught his spraying/marking and I know they did it at his old place.  This is where I may possibly be TA: early in our relationship he once mentioned he never wanted to get his cats fixed, it wasn't up for discussion. At the time it didn't matter to me as us living together wasn't even on the table. But now? I'm  desperate . I'm not sure what else to do other than demand he get his cats fixed.  I'm not getting rid of either him or his cats - so, reddit, WIBTA?   Tldr;  WIBTA if I demand my boyfriend get his cats fixed after he said he'd never do it due to their constant spraying/marking?   Edit 2/2:  Thank y'all for the comments and advice. I'm going to do some proper research and present it to him as just another way to take care of the cats and our sanity. 😺\n",
      "My son (15) has a friend who is currently in inpatient mental health treatment. Even though the patients are underage, visitors under 18 aren't allowed, for whatever reason. My son asked me to go visit for him and give his friend some comics, a letter and a pizza. Apparently the food there is bad, but you can bring outside food to visits and patients can eat it during the visit.  The thing is, I don't want to go. His parents go and see him most days, and I'm sure they bring snacks. I told my son I could give them the comics and letter to give him. He said no, because he doesn't trust them not to read his letter. Well, I really don't want to go to the hospital. I just don't feel comfortable.  My son said I'm being a judgemental asshole, but I'm not judging his friend, I just don't want to go. I don't even know what I would say to him. Would I just sit in silence and watch him eat pizza? I told him to ask his dad, but my husband works weird hours and would only be able to go on the weekends, and apparently the parents always go on weekends.  My son is really disappointed in me and angry at me, but don't I have the right to have boundaries? He told me that I was lying when I said he can ask me for anything. He can ask, but this is one request I don't think I can fulfill.  Update: I read everyone's comments and a handful actually had productive feedback or information. Based on one person's idea I will schedule a time to go when my son isn't busy and then facetime him in the visiting area. He and his friend will get to have a (mostly) private \"face to face\" chat, his friend will get to enjoy his pizza and he'll get his letter and comics. It'll be pretty much a visit between them, and I'll just be the chauffer, basically. Thank you to the people who responded in good faith and actually read the post before commenting, as few of you as there were.\n",
      "The term “associate” in my title is a bit loose as i had only met the man a few times. We had know each other through the cosplay community that my then GF was an avid member. The man in question was a rising photographer. His work was good, but not great.   Once during a meetup, I met his... girlfriend? She was pretty, certainly out of his league. She also wasn’t a part of the community so naturally i was curious how they met. She was actually a model he took pictures of a few times. They told me that they were so in love, they didn’t hesitate to move in together. All kinds of flags are going up in my head.  Then the unimaginable happens, another guy shows up and kisses her, HARD. I cant describe how awkward i felt in the moment. I pulled my GF aside and asked what the deal was. She said their relationship was polyamorous. Of course i could not stop asking questions.   Turns out they, the “COUPLE”, haven’t even had sex in the few months they were together. (Or at least since they decided that they were poly) The more information i got the more horrified i would become. She would bring guys to the room they shared and have him take walks for hours. Im for people being in open relationships but this seemed wrong.  All day i avoided watching this girl make out with and caress another guy while her “BOYFRIEND” shrunk into a corner. I was noticeably uncomfortable FOR the guy. I thought he was getting taken advantage of because he liked a girl. Out of nowhere she leaves with the OTHER GUY but not before kissing the first guy on the cheek and says, “see you at home babe.” I cringed.  I don’t like when people are used by their SO’s and i wont hold my tongue about it. But i decided this time i would just tell my GF. I told her, “that doesn’t sound like a real relationship to me. Sounds very one sided and thats not fair.”  GF: “She just likes sex, why is that such a big deal?”  Me: “Why haven’t THEY done it then? They live together. Sounds like sex would be easy. He clearly is bothered by it too but doesn’t say anything. That’s not a boyfriend, thats a cuck.”  My gf calls me an asshole and we say nothing the rest of the night. I never saw them again. My gf stopped bringing me to the meetups she knew he’d be there. I hated going anyway.   Was i an asshole for just speaking my mind?   Guy i knew was in a POLYAMOROUS relationship but it seemed like it was an excuse for the girl to be a floozy while he waited on her hand and foot. In private, i told my GF that he sounded like a cuck. She called me an asshole.  LONG STORY SHORT: Guy i knew was in a (air quote) POLYAMOROUS (air quote) relationship but it seemed like it was an excuse for the girl to be a floozy while he waited on her hand and foot. I called him a cuck (not to his face) and GF called me an asshole.\n",
      "AITA!? my neices wanted 2 kittens and their parents both agreed to it. I ended up rescuing 3 kittens from a shed in a lady's backyard. The lady was terrified of cats and the mom was MIA so she asked us to find the kittens and take them. Kittens were starving and had fleas and so dirty from not being taken care of but i decided we should take them and save them. I already have 2 cats at home and decided i would adopt the 3rd kitten since my neices were only allowed to bring home 2 of them. I bathed and fed the kittens the 1st night they came home. Got rid of ALL fleas and de-wormed them. Kittens are incredibly cute and long hair domestics. The girls finally took them home and everything was going well. Then the girls came to spend the night at my house and asked if they could bring along their kittens so i agreed since it was only one night.  Then the next day when its time to take the cats home with the girls the mom all of a sudden says that landlord does not want cats in the home.. so i let the cats stay another night and my older neice but i told her this morning she and her parents have to find what to do with the kittens because it is their responsibility. They accepted the cats and 2 weeks later all of a sudden just cant have cats. I told my neice \"im sorry but these cats are going back to your home today. I can not afford to have 5 cats at my house. You guys have to find someone to adopt them or find where to take them.\" She called her mom and her mom seemed upset but she accepted the responsibility of the 2 kittens. Am i in the wrong here for not taking in the 2 extra kittens i cant afford and making her resolve rehoming the kittens on her own? My neice spent the whole night crying at my house because she was told she cant keep them anymore and her mom seems to think i will be keeping them here at my house 😳. Went out and bought ice cream and cookies to help her feel a little better but she still woke up crying. I am not keeping them, i am dropping the 2 kittens off with the 2 girls tonight after we go to the movies tonight..\n",
      "*** Typed on mobile so please bare with with.   I just started this job on Monday and found out that my co worker doesn't have a car. She lives about an hr away and I live 5 min away. Yesterday as we were leaving our supervisor walked out with us and because they are smokers they stayed back. The supervisor apparently gave her a ride to the bus stop 2 blocks away (going east and then south). I have a second job and leave straight for it when I leave my primary job. She asked me today if I could take her to the bus stop and I told her that no because it's not in the direction of where I'm going (south and I had to repeat about 2 more times because she kept saying well it's only 2 blocks away) and she said \"well we can go south and then east to the bus stop\" and I said \"I'm not going east at all\" so she just said \"ok well you can drop me off to the intersection and I'll walk that block\". The distance of where we were and where I dropped her off was about 100 ft. probably less.   I know that once you do something like that for people they tend to keep asking and asking. I do not have the patience for that.  I dont want her to think that she can start asking me to take her to bus stop and whatnot. She also asked me what I would be doing for lunch. I know I already think the worst in people and I feel that she was just asking to see if maybe I could take her somewhere.   I dont care to come off as rude, I am straight to the point person, although it's not really what I aim for. I think people are afraid to not speak up but I have another job to get to and I cannot be putting your needs before my responsibilities.   AITA for not wanting to give rides?   *She has not asked me to start giving her rides, I don't want her to think she can.  UPDATE: she don't like me anymore and/or is bothered with me. She went from being friendly to not talking to me at all unless we are in the office with the supervisor. Lols. How can someone think they have a right to other peoples stuff and time while only knowing them for a couple of days?\n",
      "Long story short my father and mother split when I was 3 and he’s since remarried with children. We’ve not had a good relationship due to some of the shit he’s put me through in the past which I won’t go into detail as I’m not sure it’s needed.   At the age of 15 we saw each other once a month to which i’d mostly help at work and then moved interstate at 17 and didn’t see him for around 7 years until i moved back to the same state to study my masters of architecture. During the two and a half years i spent studying my masters we tried to reconnect. This has gone as well as it could considering past events but still not great as i haven’t been able to let go of some resentment.   I invited him to two events. The first if which i was to showcase my work with drinks + food provided. He bailed last minute saying it wasn’t that important as it wasn’t my final design.  The second was my final design presentation and he bailed last minute as he had a last minute meeting and said its probably best he didn’t come as my mum was there (they don’t like each other at all).   So now we fast forward to my graduation. I had two guest tickets and was sceptical inviting him because of having the two parents in the same vicinity as one another for a few hours and the idea of him flaking again. Instead, I invited my sister and mother, we had a lovely day and took a bunch of photos.   A few days later i get a call from him and the conversation went a little like  Him: hey Me: hi H: i got some photos of you M: what of?  H: your graduation, i didn’t realise you’d graduated  M: yeah, just two days ago was pretty boring ceremony (droning on about the wait etc) but at least it’s all done H: congratulations, but why wasn’t i invited?  M: thanks! But I didn’t think you’d be interested, especially being around mum for a few hours  H: i did say i’d want to come M: i don’t remember that (because he said no such thing)  H: oh well, it’s done now congratulations again.  And that was the end of the conversation.   My sister thinks I’m an asshole for not inviting him to at least get photos and for telling him i didn’t think he’d be interested in coming.  I just want to know if i’m crazy for not wanting/ inviting him there considering a few people have called me out. It felt like he wasn’t being genuine and it was some fake show of admiration/affection.   If i can maintain a relationship with him that would be great as he owes me a great deal of money and i would like it back. I’d just like to know what you all think so i can move forward with some sense of clarity.   Side notes:    he’s not supported me at all during any studies let alone financially since parents split.   He asked for my final grade prior to the grad and i told him what i got which i think is awesome (top of my class) considering the hardships i had going at the time. He said that he thought i should of got a better mark than what i did.\n",
      "My (M25) husband is a big back seat driver when I (F25) drive. He’s always making comments about my driving (ie; slow down, there’s a red light, watch the curb, turn wider, etc.). While I’ll admit he is the better driver, the comments still hurt. I’ve been in 3 fender benders (2 were other drivers faults, 1 was mine - I was in college and dumb), but haven’t ever been pulled over, totaled a car, or had a serious accident. All were 5+ years ago when I was living in a college town and didn’t cause more than a few scratches. He’s been in 2, both not his fault, but one created serious damage to the back of the car and the other was a deer that caused serious damage to the front.  For the last few years, I’ve slowly become increasingly frustrated with his comments. I’ve expressed that his comments don’t help the situation, but make me more nervous and likely to make mistakes, so I asked him to please stop. He may be right, but in the moment I get nervous from his tone and judgement. He vehemently refused, saying that he thinks I’m a reckless driver and he doesn’t feel comfortable so he has a right to tell me how to drive.  I’m also the main one who drives in the relationship, especially during long distance trips, so this is a common issue.   I’ve explained that his “suggestions” don’t help, but instead make me nervous and feel as though he doesn’t think I’m capable of driving even though I’ve driven for around 10 years and commuted in DC for my job everyday before the pandemic. It’s at the point where I’m becoming a worse driver with him in the passenger seat because because his comments stress me out. I no longer feel like a confident driver. I’ve even offered compromise, he can tell me what made him feel unsafe during a drive AFTER I’m in a safe spot, not during the event.   Today after a dinner out, it came to a head and I told him he needs to stop backseat driving or I’m done driving us. His response was that he is going to continue to make the comments when he feels the “value of the car is threatened.” I got angry and said said fine, I’m done driving us then.   I really don’t mind driving as long as I don’t feel stressed from his comments, but I honestly can’t take it anymore. I feel that I might be the asshole because I’m letting my emotions affect my driving, and that I’m taking it out on him by refusing to do an important shared responsibility. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "Obligated on mobile so excuse any formatting issues.  So the title pretty much says it. My mom is one of the managers at a retail store in the mall by our house, and due to a few factors surrounding the pandemic, they’ve been sort of short staffed as of late.   A few weeks ago while she was taking me to school she told (not asked) me she needed me to work for her on Black Friday, as her company had changed the previous rules about not allowing them to employ family. I already have a job myself at a gift shop for an art exhibit so I pointed out that I would probably already have to work that day, and she replied “oh I know, you can just work both though.”  Problem is I don’t want to. Since I typically close, I’m usually already exhausted by the time I get off, and that’s on the days where I’m sleeping until about 2 hours before my shift. If I were to work at my mom’s job, I’ll likely have to open, so I’d be up at like 7am and not have a break or time to rest until 12am when I get off my own job. I also chose this job specifically so that I wouldn’t have to deal with the stress of working at the mall during holiday season again, as even at our busiest my job is relaxed in comparison to my last one at the same mall. I also don’t want to work specifically for my mom and add “employee” to the dynamic of our relationship.  She gets offended easily, so I just gently told her I didn’t think I would be able to, she fought me on it for a bit but I had to get out the car to go to class so she dropped it. A few weeks later she brought it up again, and I outright told her I wasn’t going to able to work for her because I didn’t want to be at the mall on Black Friday, and she dropped it again until yesterday, when I told her while she was taking me to class how the exhibit I work at got extended again past the new year. I think because of our previous conversations she decided to be kind of sneaky about it, because she asked me when I would find out my schedule for the day after Thanksgiving, never outright saying Black Friday. I’m not stupid so I told her I wouldn’t know until pretty much that week, because we get our schedule on Fridays. She got upset at my answer, ad told me to just ask anyways because my job is technically retail and my boss was probably making the schedule already (he’s not), but before I could retaliate we arrived at my school and I had to get out the car since I was already late.  I’m ngl, I’m a little pissed about how she keeps bringing this up despite me repeatedly telling her my answer. But when I was venting to my younger sister, who already does work at the store, she called me lazy and selfish for not wanting to help out.   Is she right? I mea it’s not that I CANT help, it’s purely I just don’t WANT to. A small part of me can’t help but feel bad, and my sister’s input isn’t helping.   How can I go about this and avoid any conflict and coming off as a selfish asshole? Or is that exactly what I am?\n",
      "For context I [24F] share a 2 bedroom apartment with a married couple and their 70lbs dog. We’ll call them Ethan [24M] and Becky [21F]. We split our rent in half but the utilities in 3 respectively. I lived in this same apartment a year before they came to move in, so practically all of the communal things in our living room and kitchen are things I paid for from my initial move. I also have an old family dog that stays with me occasionally that Ethan and Becky were fine with and we had no issues for awhile.  Because of personal problems, I left our apartment for 4 months to stay with my parents. I still paid for my half of the rent and my portion of all the utilities while I was away, so they really benefited from my situation. Well fast forward to now, my parents are separating and living in separate places which doesn’t allow room for all our pets. My dad can only take our cat since he’s staying in an apartment, my mom can only take the older, more low maintenance dog because she works all day, so that leaves me with a puppy we rescued a few months ago.  Because of how everything sorted out, I didn’t know I was taking the dog back with me until mid October. As soon as I found out I let my roommates know that I will be returning in the beginning of November with my family dog that has nowhere else to go. Of course I understand that I told them pretty last minute and that they may have to adjust how they’ve been living for the past 4 months with not only my return, but my own dog as well. But I thought since maybe I’ve always been considerate of them moving in with their dog, they might extent to me the same courtesy.  I was so wrong. They felt wronged that I’m planning to bring home a dog they’ve never met without discussing with them beforehand. I apologized for how abruptly I notified them of the change but I couldn’t really discuss with them as this was a situation that pertained only to my family. I then offered ways to help all of us transition and acquaint our dogs easier, sacrificing a lot of my convenience to accommodate to them. However, they keep pushing the point that I have disrespected them and they don’t want another dog in the apartment we share. I just can’t help but be a little upset since I still pay for all my share of the apartment. They were fine with my older dog staying with us indefinitely but not this one? And I don’t understand how they can tell me I can’t bring my dog when they have a dog of their own. I feel like since I was away for a few months, they started treating it like the apartment was solely theirs when I am the original owner. I really think I did all I could to inform them, apologize, and try to work around our new living arrangement. But AITA for still bringing a dog to my roommates’ dismay?\n",
      "My (45m) fiance (40f) is not a fan of drinking.  She is NOT a drinker and had some experiences when she was in her 20's with her friends group where her friends would drink while they were all out together and she basically had to babysit them bc they were drunk or they would not want to hang out with her bc she would tell them they shouldn't drink or I guess she was kind of a buzzkill for them.  Since then, she's always looked down on drinking and pretty much admonishes other people for doing it.  She knew when we got together that I did drink occasionally and I told her that I would likely continue as I saw fit (keep in mind I'm not getting smashed by any means or going out and partying, etc).  She didn't like that and expected me not to do it anymore since we were engaged now.  I pretty much told her that she's overreacting and that I'm an adult and can make decisions responsibly and if I want to drink every now and then, that I have the right and authority to choose to do so.  She wasn't happy with that, but I guess accepted it. I should say that she does smokes pot every now and again and so do I (seldomly).  When she's with her girlfriends, if they decide to start drinking, she'll end up leaving and going home bc she doesn't want to be around it.  Or if there's a chance they might be drinking during an outing, she just won't go.  Every now and then I like to enjoy a cold one, particularly after a long or stressful day.  I only do it when I'm home and have no needs or plans to go anywhere.  Usually when I do drink, I have one (or multiple) when she's working nightshift and then I'll just go to bed.  Well, a couple of days ago she came home early and I was sitting on the couch drinking a beer.  I wasn't even drunk, maybe barely buzzed.  She flipped and immediately left.  I texted her later defending my actions and apologized that she left.  I didn't hear back from her for over 24 hours.  She never responded to my calls or texts.  When she finally called me back, I found out she went to stay with her sister for a few days bc she felt betrayed by me.  I love her dearly and I want her to be happy but I also don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong and I REALLY don't like being told what I can and cannot do. AITA?\n",
      "First, let me set the scene: I am now a senior in high school, however, I had to move with my family to a new school in a new town starting my senior year. Coming into this year, I knew I didn't want it to be something I just got out of the way before heading to college, i wanted it to be a year I cherished.  I did quickly find a group of people to hang out with so I never had the \"sitting alone in the lunchroom\" experience and this group was never disgruntled or mad about me tagging along.  One last bit of necessary information was that our calculus teacher awarded extra points for those who got together for calculus study groups outside of class and after seeing the master sheet for the 2nd Trimester, which had a record of everyone's study groups, I saw that my space was completely blank while my friends had at least 5 sessions. I then learned that they had a group chat for the \"Honors Squad\" where they shared notes and stuff like that. No big deal, just add me in. However, I'm an android user. Citing the fact that they wouldn't be able to keep the name of their iMessage group, they didn't add me and just told me to text them if I felt I needed notes.  Being a new student, I'm a bit paranoid. So when I'm not in this group chat, I don't know what I'm missing out on.  I mull over this situation by myself and with my parents and we figure out that I could use one of our old iPads as a texting device so that my friends can keep using iMessage groups. I just got added to the group today, but I voiced my frustrations to my friends about having to go through the trouble of getting an Apple device just so that I could communicate with them. Their response \"Ah well, deal with it.\"  That attitude made me feel really insulted. I was getting left out of stuff (or maybe not, I don't know, because I'm not being communicated with) just because they can't name their group chat. They refused to use third-party messaging software and left it up to me earn my way into their group chat.  In my discussion with them earlier today, they straight up told me to \"just buy an iPhone\" or \"If you were a better friend, we'd add you.\" These comments are probably jokes, but one thing that wasn't a joke was that they were unwilling to add me until I owned an Apple device.  Three things to add just for fairness sake:     There are a couple more android users in our grade (it's a small grade) and they are also getting left out, so it doesn't seem like personal thing    I have no idea what kind of stuff I'm missing out on. It could just be nothing. This frustration is mostly fueled by lack of communication and paranoia especially regarding those calculus study groups I mentioned earlier.    I have still been invited to things. I got invited to participate in their Secret Santa, I got invited to a Superbowl party, and I got invited to a birthday party. So it's not like I'm being left out of everything.\n",
      "I was born on a cold winter night in Illinois. My parents got divorced when I was 4. My dad died from a heroin overdose when I was 9. At a young age my sister and I both agreed my mother was crazy. She was overcontrolling and borderline verbally abusive to my sister. She told my sister after a fight that she wishes she never gave birth to her.My mom always takes things to the next level. She can go from a 3 to a 16 out of nowhere. After my sister moved to college, I was stuck with her alone at age 15. I had anxiety issues. I was diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety, Depression. I was prescribed all types of drugs. After fighting with my mom on a daily basis, my godmother/great aunt offered to MOVE to where I was to finish highschool. My mom agreed. My mother signed over her guardianship of me to my great aunt. My great aunt is rich. I loved living with her. I still had my problems. I still did bad in school, still tried to hide smoking weed.   I got suspended from school for having a roach in my backpack, and that was the last straw for my mom. She started a process to send me to Rosecrance. At this point I felt like I actually hated my mom.  My aunt in California saw all this going on. She called me and offered for me to stay with her in California to finish Senior year. I said yes. My great aunt bought my plane ticket, I got on the plane. It was like of a movie scene in my head. Nobody told my mom.   My sister tells my mom, after I was already on the plane. My mom was INFURIATED. She completely cut off EVERYBODY in the family. My grandma, and other aunt who had actually nothing to do with it.   So reddit, AITA for not telling my mother?\n",
      "So my girlfriend was at a party with all of our friends, but I had work so I didn’t go. She texts me later that night that one of the guys there put his arm around her and she put a stop to it real quick. To be honest I didn’t think much of that because it could have been a totally friendly gesture but she ends up explaining that he tried hugging her a lot and when he did it was like extra tight or something (he was drunk btw).   Point is, she said she felt uncomfortable. This didn’t sit well with me, so I told her I’d talk to him. I knew she wouldn’t want me to get into an altercation so I told her I was not looking to fight this kid but rather tell him to calm down with it because it made her uncomfortable and I don’t want anyone making my girlfriend feel that way.  Even though I said that, she still insisted that I keep my mouth shut because she’ll feel awkward around him and it’ll make her upset if I do.   Honestly now I feel like taking to this kid regardless of how she’s gonna feel because I don’t think it should matter if she feels awkward. He made her uncomfortable, and that shouldn’t just go unnoticed. If I talk to this guy about it, am I an asshole for being selfish and not caring about her? Been pondering this for a while now.  EDIT: Apparently he also started to push her into a corner. She told him to stop a bunch of times and he didn’t.\n",
      "So, I’ll try to make it short. Basically, whenever my boyfriend hangs out with our friends (we share the same friend group) without me, it makes me really really sad, like cry myself to sleep level of sad since I can’t be there and my friends are having fun without me. I kind of guess that it has to do with me fearing being replaced and them just having fun without me and not “needing” me anymore and in the end, my boyfriend is at no fault since I often have issues with handling my emotions (concerning crying over little things that upset me like this, no I don’t get angry at him or anything, don’t worry reddit) and he isn’t doing anything wrong. Still, he kinda knows that it makes me really sad. Would it be an asshole move to talk to him about it and ask for him to show some compassion and understanding for it? I know I don’t have the right to stop him from hanging out with them without me in any way, that would be hella controlling, but I’d kinda like not crying myself to sleep every time this happens and he kinda shows no understanding for my sadness concerning this?  Thanks if someone would care to answer :)  (To clarify, it isn’t often that this happens and I am probably just over dramatic anyways and it often is my “fault” that I can’t be there, so in the end I really am the issue here)  Edit: I am the asshole, and in need for some emotional therapy :) Thanks Reddit for pushing me through this rather sad pitty party!\n",
      "I (30F) turned 30 yesterday. My mum and my auntie took me out for lunch. The entire time they were bickering with each other which made me feel a little uncomfortable and like I didn't want to be there in the first place.   For context I was meant to be going out in the evening with my partner, my sister and her partner. Due to money being tight and my daughter being unwell I decided me and my partner were going to stay home with our children instead. All I wanted was to watch a film in bed with my partner and eat chocolate. That was my plan for the evening. My sister and her partner had arranged for my mum to watch their two children and still go out. Absolutely fine I had no issues with this.   My youngest son and my niece and nephew go to the same child care provider. My mum rang me and asked me to pick them up and said she didn't know why my sister hadn't asked me. I responded saying maybe because I would have to pick my son up and then drop my niece and nephew with her instead of just coming home. My mum then said \"Well they are going to be back for half 6 why would you need to drop them off with me?\" I responded \"So in other words your asking me to have them\". So I ended up picking them both up having to give them dinner as well as my own 3 kids. One of which is still ill.   My sister had gone to see Avatar 2. Which is a long film. My sister didn't come back until 9:30pm. She did get me a cake which was lovely and none of this was her fault. This meant that I didn't get to chill out like I planned and all of my children were still up.   My mum has since called me this morning I told her how I wasn't happy with how my day went yesterday. Since it was my birthday and ended up being a babysitter for my sister to go out on my 30th. My mum has said I am ungrateful because everyone made the effort for my birthday.  Am I the ass hole for saying my birthday was ruined.\n",
      "Ok context.  I’m 21 years old and I still live with my family.  But I pay rent and stuff.  Something I do is digital art, and I use an art tablet with a pen.  Everyday Im working on art, and rarely do anything else.  I just came home, and I see that my mother and stepfather cleaned up my room (Without my permission) and though I was appreciative, I noticed that my tablet pen wasn’t in it’s usual position.  I was panicking cause I had stuff that I needed to work on and my mom tells me that she might have threw it in the trash.  Sure enough, after 20 minutes of searching I found it.  But now they’re yelling at me about how ‘unappreciative I am’ and how much of a slob I am (I will admit, I am, but thats besides the point).  They see me work on art everyday, staying up at late hours and they didn’t think that this thing was important to me?  Like it doesn’t matter...or my passions are important.  So reddit, AITA here?  I know I probably am but whatever\n",
      "AITA here? A few days ago it was my wedding day. My groomsman came to grab me in the morning and take me to the venue. This is 9:30am on a Friday.  We had stuff to put in the car, i also didn't want my cats escaping so we shut the door in between each trip. The front door must have opened and closed a maximum 5 times over a 15 minute period.  On the last time, fully dressed in my suit at this stage, i shut the door and was headed to the car as i hear my neighbour behind me shout 'EXCUSE ME! EXCUSE ME! STOP BANGING YOUR DOOR CLOSED ITS VERY LOUD AND IS SHAKING MY HOUSE'  I explained that was the last time and we were done now and were going. She however continued to rant about it but as i had places to be i completely cut her off and said 'it's done now. I'm going' repeating that 3 times as i walked to the car whilst she was trying to moan.   Who's the asshole here as it pissed me off for half the drive down\n",
      "I havent missed it yet, it's actually this upcoming Saturday.  Background: my parents are divorced and my sister and I have switched between households every week since we were 10. When they plan parties they plan them on the week we will be there. (In order to avoid conflict)  Due to COVID, the church has had to split events into small groups. My sisters sacrament is being done this Saturday and only 3 people can accompany them.   That same saturday, my dad planned my 3 year old brothers birthday party. Although it is my moms week, my sister and I are both 18 and dont have to follow the schedule anymore. We are following it tho until we leave for college to avoid arguments.   Well anyways, my mom and dad asked me to take the day off. I did but I wasnt given the day. Also my moms side of the family is not showing up because they have they're own event to attend.   So then, my mom yelled at me for a solid 45 minutes about how I was a terrible sister. How my sisters will never forget how work was more important than them. How my dad and her sister are always out to screw her over. How my sister and I love my dad more and wont show up.   Without getting heated, I tried to explain that my dad didnt intentionally plan that day to mess with my mom. And that I'm going to try to come home early. And that I wasnt working on purpose to avoid an important event.   She didnt believe me. She told me not to show up at all.   Am I the asshole for potentially having to miss both, my sisters communion and my brothers birthday?   Also my shift is from 11pm to 7pm and it's a small family gathering.\n",
      "My son in 5.  I have had him since he was born.  His bio mom is 24 and recently graduated college.  He has had regular contact with her his whole life, but I’ve encouraged him to think of her as a cousin or friend.  For the past few months, she’s been acting differently around him and encouraging him to call her mom.  Now that she’s able to support herself, she wants to have him for a few nights a week.  I told her no, because I’m his mom and she would put him in daycare during the day and only be with him at night.  I’m a SAHM and am with him all the time.  She said it’s cruel of me to keep her away from her son.  I said that if she loved him so much, then she shouldn’t have given him up 5 years ago.  She said that she gave him up because she wasn’t able to support herself and now that she is, she wants him back.  I said that you don’t get to abandon your child then decide that you want him 5 years later and that he considers me his mother.  She said that he will start thinking of her as mom if he has time to bond.  I said that if she continues trying to steal him from me, then I will stop letting her meet him.  My husband says I’m being paranoid and there’s no way she can get him back now.  Am I the asshole?  Edit:  We are his legal parents.  She is related to us, she's my husband's second cousin.\n",
      "Backstory: I (36M) was married for 14 years. During that time, my parents, who live on the other side of the country, liked to see us about three times a year. Once when they would visit us, once when we would visit them, and a third when we would all meet up at a fun location and vacation together. I made enough to support my wife and kids, but not enough extra to pay for plane tickets and hotels, so my parents would always pay for us.   About a year ago, my wife left me for another man, and we went thru a painful divorce. I spent a couple months in a cheap motel, trying to find somewhere to stay, but it was difficult. I finally asked my parents to co-sign on a lease with me. They refused, saying they'd rather buy a house in my area, and let me rent it from them. That way they could visit more often and not have to stay in a hotel the whole time. I didn't have any other options, so that's what we did.   They came to visit when we closed on the house, to help me move in. The day I moved in, they told me their rule: I couldn't have a partner live with me if we were unmarried. I had also come out to them as bisexual that visit, so they said I couldn't have a same gendered partner live with me under any circumstances, as they don't recognize same-sex marriages as legitimate marriages. I was pretty upset, but it was too late to back out, so I had to go along with it.   A few months ago, I started dating a girl, and it's starting to get serious. The last time my parents visited, they wanted to plan for upcoming visits/vacations, and I told them I wanted my gf to come. They said that was fine, but we would have to stay in separate rooms. I told them that we're both grown adults, we've both been married and divorced, and we have no plans on getting married again, ever. They said they didn't care, that was their rule and they weren't backing down. So I told them I would no longer be visiting them or going on vacations with them, until they agree to 1) accept that I'm bi, and 2) treat me and my partner like adults and a legitimate couple. They asked if my kids could come visit them without me, and I said absolutely not. Any place where I'm not welcome, my kids certainly aren't going.   They're now very upset and saying I'm disrespecting them and their religious beliefs (which is why they're against my sexuality and being unmarried with a partner). AITA?\n",
      "Okay please hear me out (also throwaway for anonymity).  I’m doing a law degree, it’s tough on everyone. I have been pretty consistent over the last couple years, never being out of the top 20% in any course and being top in a few courses. This is important for context and I’m not trying to brag.  Anyway, we have an assignment due next week. In my opinion it’s probably the easiest assignment we’ve had and we have basically been spoon-fed the information and all we have to do is read the cases and the answers are there in black & white. Honestly it is not that difficult.   Anyway, I met a girl a few weeks ago who is in my class and we kinda spoke and swapped numbers etc, just normal stuff. Since then, she has messaged me a lot about coursework which I have responded to and been helpful. Anyway, last night she sends me a really long message about this assignment and basically asks about every aspect of it. I want to help but honestly all she needs to do is read what we have been given and will find the answers. I feel obliged to help because she has been so kind to me but at the same time I don’t want to be telling her what I have (especially if it’s wrong!).   This morning another girl messages me and she is like way off in what she’s thinking of writing (in my opinion, I am not the expert). I don’t want to steer her in the direction I’m going with it because again I might be wrong. I think people trust me because of my performance so far, but it doesn’t mean I know everything.   Anyway I’m getting kinda miffed because I feel like people just want my friendship for me to help them. Some people literally only message me when they need help, which is a shame. I have no issue with helping people but it gets kinda upsetting if it’s the only reason they want my help. Maybe I am being unreasonable though.   AITA for not wanting to continue helping them?\n",
      "My husband and I are 7 weeks into a major renovation on our home. The general contractor is the owner of a company that also makes cabinets. We learned after the project started that he is running at least 10 job sites at one time in addition to cabinet only orders.   We communicate mostly via text and email. He writes back sometimes, but often does not respond to specific questions.   When the light in a hallway was removed by crew, we found a fairly large hole that needs drywall in order for a new light fixture to be installed. We asked the drywall crew if it was something they could fix, and they said it was.  This morning, we recieved this text from the general contractor, \"They can do it but I have to charge you for their time. As I have asked you both previously. Do not talk to my guys or my trades about work. All communication must go thru me. If this happens again I will be forced to shut your project down and you have to meet with me on everything. I am trying to run your project as efficiently and professionally as possible. You both keep trying to do things without my consent. This is wrong. \"  We were told one other time to not talk to his crew. We asked a question about split wood and bubbling laminate on a mantle they made and installed via email. The general contractor did not answer, so we asked the site manager what the plan was.  Are we out of line? The crew found the hole. We asked a question.  Of course we will pay for the work. It seems like a reasonable exchange with the customer and the on site crew.\n",
      "Hi. My friends and I are in high school (I don't know if that matters or not) and there is a guy that we all think of as a friend. We'll call him John. John is kind of annoying. He's always yelling and when we play video games he screams at us and the other team. We ask him to stop and he says he will but he never does. It's not always like this though. He also has good moments where he's calm and quite enjoyable to be around.  This has been happening for months and we've all gotten tired of it so a week ago we decided to remove John from our group chat for a third time. He's been messaging some of us saying that he's sorry and that he won't do it again, but that's what he said the other two times. I feel bad because when he's not yelling he's really nice.\n",

I've been asking my boss about a raise for at least the last 3 years and have pretty much been waved off. Anyways, I get my annual performance review this morning and it's all glowing remarks and thank yous from my boss and assistant manager. after 15 minutes of telling me how much of an asset I am to the company, etc. etc., boss says \"So I'm gonna give you a $1 an hour raise.\"  While I'm happy to get anything, it feels like a pittance. it's a 4% raise while my workload over the last 6 years has doubled.  AITA for complaining about getting a raise?\n",
      "My wife (31) and I (37) are aspiring cooks. We share the responsibility of meals but we each have our own specialty foods only the other makes and ironically, baking is her strong point and grilling is mine. My wife is a phenomenal baker, I can't even bake the Pillsbury square premade cookies correctly. She's always making something fancy for fun and taking it to work or giving it to people and they rave about it. She has a good gift for baking.  Today, she decided to make a thank you cake for the volunteers at her job. She made a two tiered cake from scratch and even made the frosting for it. She decided to do something she called... \"Untraditional\" for the cake. She had cut off a skinny sliver from each layer and then crumbled it onto the frosting side as like a wall. Then she heated some frosting and then drizzled it all over the edges. It was an ugly looking cake to be honest and she's under the weather at the moment. To ME, mind you I suck at baking and knew better than to be in her way while she was making it, it looked like she slapped frosting on it and then cut the circle shape out. It was rough looking but our toddler was helping her, so I thought it was just her saving a mistake our daughter made.  I saw it and praised our toddlers good job at helping and then asked my wife what happened to it. She said, \"what do you mean?\" I said, \"it looks like it got messed up and you tried to save it. Is it done? Don't you gotta smooth out the sides? It looks a bit ugly without wall frosting (I don't know the terminology).\" She said, \"I decided to make an untraditional cake. It's supposed to look like a mess.\"  Later on, she tells me she's annoyed and upset with me that I called her cake ugly and she wants an apology. I don't think I did anything wrong and while I've been around the block a time or two, I'm smart enough to pick my battles. I'll apologize since it's important to her but I'm not quite sure what it is I'm apologizing for. If it's supposed to look messy, then why am I in trouble for saying it looked ugly?  AITA for saying that it looked ugly, if that's how it's supposed to look?  TLDR: wife made a messy cake on purpose and I said it looked ugly and now I'm in trouble for it.\n",
      "(Sorry for Format I’m a Mobile User also apologies for any mistakes in grammar English is my 3rd language)  Last week my boyfriend (M20) and I (F19) went to his sister’s (F27) wedding. I wore a gown with Kente print and a matching head wrap. If you don’t know what Kente print is, it is a traditional Ghanaian print.  I made sure to check in with my boyfriend’s sister before hand that this was okay to wear to her wedding, because I know that some people don’t think Kente print can be formal. She told me that she loved the gown and actually told me she’d be mad if i didn’t wear it.   During the wedding, I noticed that i was getting many dirty looks, all from which came from the grooms side. Flash forward to present day and i recieved a text from the groom saying that I was out of line and that I should have asked him if i could wear it, because his family was from the south and they had traditional views, and went as far to say I embarrassed him in front of his family.   My boyfriends sister found out what he had said and has apologized on his behalf.  I think i may be the asshole for only checking with the bride and not the groom. So Reddit, AITA??

      "Throw away account and changing certain details. Background: Husband (M49) and I (F47) have been married 15+ years and have a young teen son together. No other kids.  Husband has been working through family trauma over the years in various forms of therapy and I recently went through therapy as well as has our son for ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Part of having a kid with ADHD and ODD is that he has no filter and when things bug him and annoy him he just blurts them out.  Husband tends to be very high and mighty about all his years of therapy and has a really hard time being called out on certain things and many time refuses to change his approach, even if it annoys everyone else. He thinks he knows better because of all his years of therapy.  It came to a head today during breakfast when our son asked him to please stop telling him to “stop being critical”. Husband uses that phrase whenever our son is being mean or gets frustrated at himself for doing something wrong. It’s been going on for months now and it seems like he says it at least ten times a day. It shuts down the conversation as it pisses off our son because he uses it so much and it’s lost any meaning at this point. I asked him to please start using some other words as it just seems like the term is overused and our son has been asking him over and over to stop. I gave him some options so he can be more specific “stop being mean, stop saying nasty things, stop being a bully…” but he shut down the conversation and called me critical. No one can say anything to him because we’re being critical and wrong.  From then on, he refused to talk to me. He said goodbye to our son but refused to say goodbye to me as I approached him for a kiss goodbye and blamed me for his running lat for work. I said, “OK be that way.” He called me critical as he left the house.   To add, this isn’t the first time he refuses to change a phrase. Even for little things. For the longest time our son asked him to please stop saying “screen time” because it made him feel like a baby and he refused, making our son get pissed. I asked him what was the big deal with just saying “computer time”? There are other examples as well but these two were the biggest.  I feel like he’s being stubborn and not doing something basic that would ease tensions and ridiculous hills to die on. Our son feels disrespected when he just stubbornly continues.  Was it wrong to ask him to please use other words? Especially when it affects our son?\n",
      "I (18F) have posted on this sub a number of times and fully trust the advice of my fellow Redditors. This happened over winter break (December-January)  I have this one boy on Snapchat who sometimes will chat pics I post with heart emojis or a compliment or something to indicate hes interested in me. I stalked his insta and found him very cute so we talked for a few days and decided to hang out.   He lives in a house by himself but the property is owned by his grandma. He works 60 hours a week but his rent is taken care of by his grandma as long as he pays for everything else. He invites me over and I see that his house is only 10 min away! I drive over  and when I get out of the car he tells me his grandma is staying there for the weekend in the other bedroom and we’ll be ok as long as we don’t bother her.   We go to his room upstairs while grandma is downstairs. He pulls out some molly and asks me if I want some. I take “hard” drugs (acid, coke, molly) maybe once every 3 months and it had been almost 6 months since I last did molly so I said ok. I offered to pay him for it but he said it was fine. We take it, he showers and it kicks in while he’s showering. I feel great. He comes in and changes into his pajamas and we’re cuddling and watching a movie, having some deep talks, all around a good time. Then he goes downstairs for about 10 minutes and says “so....my grandma knows you’re here and she’s not happy about it. Is there any chance you could leave?” I’m FUCKED UP at this point. Not incoherent, but definitely not capable of driving home because he told me I could sleepover. I told him “I’m really really sorry but I don’t think I can drive right now I’m really high” and he said “I know, I just feel bad because it’s technically her house so if she wants you out I don’t wanna go against her wishes”. I felt super guilty because we were getting along great and I didn’t wanna piss anyone off, but I didn’t want to drive home on icy roads rolling off molly. I just kinda said “I’ll leave early tomorrow morning I’m sorry, If I knew I couldn’t sleepover I wouldn’t have taken it” but what’s done is done so I was in for the night. But he was really distant and cold after that. He didn’t put his arm around me anymore and just kinda went to bed. I was up for another 2 hours, enjoying my high, but feeling guilty that I upset him. I got like 4 hours of sleep and woke up feeling like SHIT (which I knew would happen regardless) but as soon as We were both up he reiterated the fact that grandma was PISSED and I had to leave NOW. So I got my things and left pretty quickly. I didn’t mean to upset him or cause issues with his grandma but I felt like my safety and the safety of other people on the road was more important! I got home later that morning and texted him to let him know I was home and I had fun...he blocked me on all platforms.   AITA for refusing to leave his house?\n",
      "About 2 months ago. My long term girlfriend broke up with me. 2 weeks ago she texts me saying she wants to hang out and be, \"friends\". I say yes. She then proceeds to tell me the first time we were hanging out during this period. That her father whom she lives with. Is having an affair with someone. He asked to borrow her car when it was snowing very hard one night his new car wouldn't get through the snow. She came put to a heart on her passenger window the next morning. She then told me she is being payed by her father to stay quiet  about this around her stepmother. Her stepmother is a really nice woman I respect a lot. My ex recently got upset with me and told me that she'll, \"talk to me never\". After getting upset with me because she no longer wanted to be, \"friends\". I want to tell her stepmom not only because I think it would be hilarious. Yes I'm an asshole already. Also because I feel it isn't fair to her stepmother to know and not say.  TL : DR Ex's father is cheating on her stepmother a very nice woman. Ex has been acting shitty before, during and after breakup. I want to save my ex's stepmother's time in a shitty marriage because she treated me well.\n",
      "Quick background.  My cousin is 16, almost 17, and his name is Jamie. Jamie has a lot of mental health issues, most relevantly, bipolar disorder.  He and I used to be really close when we were younger, but over time, we grew distant for a myriad of reasons I won’t discuss here. Lately, though, we’ve been talking again, and he invited me to smoke weed with him next time we meet up (post pandemic). I said no, and he accepted that, adding that he only does drugs occasionally, due to the aforementioned bipolar disorder.  This happened just over a month ago, and I  keep “forgetting” about it. I can’t decide if I should tell my mom (his aunt) or not. On the one hand, I don’t want to betray his trust and lose him again. But on the other hand, he could be doing something dangerous...  I can’t reason about this clearly due to my own trauma, so I’m hoping reddit can help. WIBTA if I told my mom about his occasional drug use?  EDIT: Yes, I’m aware that weed isn’t a hard drug, or anything close to it. However, I know it can impact brain development at his age.\n",
      "Ok opinion question. I (33) have this friend (35). And when they are too lazy to type a text, they send me a voice memo. And, like, not necessarily a short one. They’ll send me 1, 2, even 3 minute long voice memos.  These things would take me 10 seconds to READ if they were less lazy. So, AITA for refusing to listen to them?   Indeed, one could even argue that THEY are the asshole because implicit in this is the suggestion that their time/finger comfort is more important than my time.   I am going to begin to say I can’t open them currently and invite them to call, do voice to text or just text. But I refuse to indulge this annoying nonsense.   *Caveat: if they do it because they are driving and can’t type, I’ll listen. But that’s it.\n",
      "So it’s my (40f) birthday today and I honestly feel like I’m too old to be ‘celebrating’ my birthday with people other than my husband and kids. As I get older I get more and more anxious about birthdays and aging and I’d rather just pretend my birthday didn’t exist. I mainly celebrate it because my kids get a kick out of present giving and the cake and candles etc…  My parents and siblings always want to make it a family event and put it on me to organise it, and I just don’t want to. But I know if I don’t do something then my family will take it personally and I’ll end up being the bad guy. So, AITA for not wanting to celebrate my birthday?\n",
      "For some back ground, I (18F) am not the most affectionate person. Physical touch makes me highly uncomfortable so I avoid hugs and I mostly keep to myself so verbal declarations of love and few and far between. I also have a hard time being empathetic to other people which makes it difficult for me to see her perspective or read her emotions at times. That being said, I don't believe myself to be a cold or unfeeling person, I'm just not outwardly emotional unless it comes to some sort of extreme. My mom on the other hand is very expressive such as wanting to initiate hugs and kisses a lot and random moments of saying 'I love you' or saying it every phone call/text.  A few days ago I was making talking with my mom and mentioned a friend who passed her permit test. I had advised my friend to be prepared the day of her test to take a picture. When I took mine, I didn't know they'd take it that day and had just assumed they'd take my picture when I actually passed the drivers test. I went in looking messy as hell, but I was lucky to have some mascara in my purse, fresh dyed hair, and a clear skin day so my pic was good. My mom and I shared a laugh about the memory and a few moments later, I relayed a story about a super sweet cashier who saw my license as I was paying. She said she really liked the color of my hair in the picture (pink) as well as my color now (blue/purple).  When I finished, my mom made a comment in an imitation of my voice saying \"Thanks, my awesome mommy did it.\" (She used to be a hair stylist so whenever I get a new color, I enlist her help for the initial application but every time after, I touch up/re-dye my hair myself.) Her comment kind of stunned me and I stayed quiet. She continues to say, in her own voice, \"But you never say that. You never give me any of the praise I deserve. It used to hurt my feelings a lot, but now I try not to care. I'll never get any love from you.\" I continued to sit there in silence because whenever she gets in these moods, I'm not sure what to say. She goes on to say that \"I'll never be happy in a relationship unless I learn to fix myself. And if I want to have a string of unsuccessful relationships then keep going.\" She calms down after, which gives me the opportunity to tell her that everything she said is bullshit. If someone compliments me on my hair, I say thank you. But when someone asks me how I do it (which happens quite frequently) I always say that she helps me the first time. Same thing for when my friends compliment me on my eyebrows, which my mom also waxes(she owns her own spa.) If they ask me where I get them done, I always refer them to her. But I don't just go around volunteering the information every time I get a compliment. As soon as I told her that, she said \"Whatever, I still think you're going to have trouble with making other people happy.\"   &#x200B;  I'm starting to wondering if she's actually valid in her feelings and I'm being an asshole or she's just using me to stroke her ego?\n",
      "Hi.  I am a single father to a 1 year-old girl (Mary).  My wife died due to complications late in her pregnancy and Mary was delivered at 33 weeks.  My MIL Kat has lived with me in the year since and was a great help.  My wife's sisters were also frequently over but the most involved was Jackie.  There was a blowup with Jackie at M's birthday party end of April where she accused me and my current (recently dating) girlfriend of having an affair before my wife passed (untrue, we were work colleagues) and some heated words were exchanged.  Then on Mother's day 2 of my SILs came over to do some celebration things with MIL and M.  They got to talking and indicated that they felt it would be best for MIL to move out (because she's getting older) and that Jackie would move in and help with M.  I said that wasn't going to happen, and they said she needed a mother and Jackie would fill that role.  I told them NOBODY would fill that role in M's life unless she decided with her heart to love someone like a mother.  I asked Jackie if that was why she was around so much and went off on my girlfriend Em but she didn't answer (They don't like Em for a lot of reasons, one being she's 12 years younger than me and another being she's catholic and not evangelical).  Jackie just said that as long as MIL lived there she would keep coming over and I couldn't stop her.  I (unfortunately) got pretty furious and grabbed a notepad and wrote 'MIL - You have 30 days to vacate' and signed it, took a picture and gave it to her.  That pretty much ended the day.  Since then MIL has been quiet (she understands why I'm upset but can't go against her daughters) but the daughters are blowing up my phone (Jackie is blocked) that MIL has nowhere to go to which I said 'I thought she was going to move out anyway.'   I'm trying to stay the course (I'll have M over summer and have daycare lined up by fall).  But they're telling me that I can't kick her out and I can't deprive M of female family connections.  So reddit, AITA?  Edit:  My main reason I felt my MIL can't live here anymore is because I'd already banned Jackie but she feels she can use MIL as an excuse to come over and see my daughter whenever she wants, and MIL refuses to set a boundry with her.  Edit 2:  To clarify timeline:  * Met my current GF 'Em' at old school, she was a student teacher but not MY student teacher. I gave her advice and mentored her for about 3 months.  Strictly professional.  * I left that school, went to my current school where my wife also worked  * Baby & Tragedy happened during that first school year, I took leave.  * Came back from leave the next fall, discovered Em now worked at my new school (starting a year after I started there)  * She was sympathetic, we began talking about six months after my wife passed\n",
      "Background: I live in a single property with three other people, one being my significant other and the other 2 being close friends of ours, we'll call them Jake and Ted. I've lived in this place a year longer than Jake and Ted (the previous one moved after a year on good terms) and we've divided the rent equally among us the entire time, treating the whole place outside of bedrooms as communal space. Initially when our previous roomy moved out we invited Ted to come stay with us because he had just lost his place of living and couldn't afford anywhere in the city by himself. I warned him several times before he moved in that I had one and only one rule of the house which was that rent could never be late by even a day, and that he only had one chance. The reason I put this rule into place was primarily that Ted had a known history among friends of being fairly irresponsible with money. We initially split the rent three ways, with him getting the two smaller bedrooms and myself and my SO getting the master bedroom. During this time and five months after he'd first moved in, Ted missed rent by a small amount, which we covered and warned him was his only chance, if he did it again we'd no longer be able to live with him.  Fast forward two and a halfish years and, another friend of ours, Jake, has lived here for about a year, taking one of the two smaller bedrooms and reducing each of Ted and Jake's rents to one quarter. Ted has now, as of yesterday, missed rent again by almost a week given that his next paycheck is a week from now.  He's never been a great room mate, he leaves messes constantly around the house, uses our belongings without asking and has frequently damaged them without offering to pay or replace them, and is a general pest, but we've been able to look past that and maintain a healthy relationship with him. What we can't overlook is that he's been mooching off of friends and family for over half of the time that he's lived here to stay on top of rent, which I only recently found out about, and which is why he missed this month, they've cut him off.  I'm not here to ask whether I'm the asshole for evicting him, I feel entirely confident that I've given him enough warning about that, and given what I know about his financial situation he is definitely capable of affording his portion, but due to his own irresponsibility he isn't so he just can't live with us anymore.  My plan as of now is to meet with him today the 1st, and remove him from the lease and give him until the end of the month to move out completely. Given his history I don't think being more lenient about it would give him the kick in the pants needed to actually get him out of the house, but at the same time, is 30 days too extreme?  WIBTA if I only gave him 30 days?  I've left out a decent amount of further detail about the situation to avoid getting even more overly wordy, so if you need more info or any specifics let me know.  &#x200B;  Edit: To add some detail about the legality of the situation, I am not the owner, however we are on a month to month lease and my plan is as follows: first meet with him and ask him to voluntarily remove himself from the lease, in which case we will help him move and be much more friendly and lenient with everything, potentially adding time to his living here in the event of him finding a new place but having to wait on it or something. Second, contact the landlord and explain the situation asking for eviction of Ted, 30 days minimum notice required in this state on MTM lease. Third will be giving him the ultimatum of basically 'if you don't leave then we will and we know you can't afford the place' and the other three of us would just move into another place.\n",
      "As preface, we have mostly had a good relationship. However with me getting a new job from the hours 1-10pm weekdays, and him getting a new puppy plus a job and another dog , I feel like our time together has been limited .  Boyfriend. has a previous habit of doing stuff for himself when I’m over , and since he has days off in the middle of the week, and more sporadic schedules (sometimes working at 5am-2pm, 3pm-11pm), from my perspective I feel like he has more flexibility . This includes sorting out Pokémon cards , organizing his pop collection , and watching anime . I participate in watching anime for him, however he knows that this is something that I am not into at all . But he does these activities when I’m over and by the time I’m done , I need to head home at midnight bc I had work that started the next day at 10am(my hours switched recently , so now I start at 1pm). This includes on days he has off , and days where he opened so he has hours before I seem him .  So now with my schedule I can only see him from 10pm-12am on weekdays.I proposed seeing him in the morning , from 8am-12pm before I headed to work at one . He agreed . I headed over to his place at 8am. We got coffee and said he wanted to go out for brunch and take the puppy . During the drive he got into a bad mood, so he drove past the brunch spot and said “we aren’t going anymore”. By 9am he went back to sleep and slept the entire duration of me being there until I had to leave for work(12pm). I got upset at this and didn’t feel like a priority and felt like he couldn’t balance having a girlfriend on top of a job , his dogs , and family/social obligations . However I am always making my way to his house and woke up to make my way there for him plus was relatively considerate with his hobbies.   Fast forward today. We went out to dinner with his co workers .  When we were there his co workers promoted having a game night afterwards (it was 7pm), my boyfriend was enthusiastic about this . However I felt like my time was not valued because on numerous occasions , when I go to his house on days that he opens at work he just wind up going to sleep when I’m there . In addition we haven’t had a weekend alone in 3 weeks . I vocalized to him that I didn’t feel prioritized and that my time was less valued than his co workers. He got upset though and felt like I was stopping him from having a good night . I ultimately did say that he could go to the game night if he wanted to of course , but he did not just because he felt like I was in a mediocre mood .   AITA for saying no and rebutting the anticipation on his side ? Is it justified that I felt like I wasn’t prioritized due to his actions when I’m over at his place ?   TL;DR. I feel like my time isn’t being valued when I go over . Tonight when his friend proposed a game night after working a morning shifts he was enthusiastic , however when I’m over he falls asleep and distracts himself .\n",
      "So, TL;DR (i dont care enough to write so much), my friend asked if i wanted to play stardew valley on the switch. she started playing botw, so i asked her if she still wanted to play stardew. and she said she was sorry, she got caught up in botw and would message me if she wanted to play stardew valley. so i waited for about 3 hours. Yes. I WAITED for THREE HOURS for the message, and then I go on my switch, and it says she's offline. I go on discord and ask her why she's offline. She responds with:  \"I was playing BOTW and didn't have my phone, chiiill.\" Now granted, it may have come off as rude, as this is what I said:  \"are you there? you're not responding to my texts so I WOULD assume you are asleep but you just got off botw, so...\" but i did follow it up with: \"sorry if i came off as rude, i was just getting kinda mad because i texted you on like 4 different places and you didn't respond. sorry for spamming you lmao.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to play some stardew valley?\n",
      "AITA? If so, please explain. My wife and I just got a decent tax return. She has been unhappy at work and has been taking about doing work from home or another office (as she is a CMA). With that said, her work had sent her an email saying that she qualified for an LPN course thru the company and that it would all be paid for. Me being excited, and tech savvy, I bought her a pretty nice laptop that she could use securely and if needed, at home. She got really upset with me because I did not talk this purchase thru her but yet she was willing to allow me to spend $500+ for an Xbox. The laptop after discount and taxes was around $600. I wanted to surprise her and use the funds put aside for my Xbox for her to further her career and/or find something from home. She wants to move but approved funds for a gaming system. I just want to know if me deciding to use the money on her instead of me was me being the A-Hole in this situation or if I should have ran it by her (it being a surprise on my side to show my support and small sacrifice).  I just feel if we set that money aside for me to get a gaming system and I chose to use it on her that we didn't need to discuss the money. If it was principal, please explain.\n",
      "Apologies, I cannot make a good title for this.  Carlos has been my yard guy for a little over 20 years now. Over that time, his yard business has been extremely successful and he makes a decent amount of money. He has a son, Danny, who was around the same age as my kids Mike and Anna. The kids knew each other growing up and would go to each other's birthday parties, but otherwise weren't super close.  Anna and Danny ended up going to the same college (its a popular one in the state), and eventually announced that they had started dating. Everyone was very excited, and we invited Carlos and his family over for our Christmas dinner that year. It went really well. After a couple of glasses of wine, however, my wife made a couple of jokes regarding our yard being cut for free now. Everyone was uncomfortable and I quickly shut that down and apologized and I figured that would be the end of it.  It has not been.  Also, money is not the issue here. but my wife has a tendency to be frivolous in places where it matters and a bit of a cheapskate where it doesn't, and this has become the newest and most shocking instance. This came up every now and then for years until Anna and Danny announced their engagement. All of a sudden, it was like a dam had burst, and my wife became obsessed with the idea of getting free or discounted services, citing that they are now going to be \"family\", and that \"family doesn't charge family\". I finally told her that Danny might come into the family but that Carlos isn't our family, and it is perfectly fine for us to remain close customers to him. I've done absolutely everything I can to keep this away from Carlos, Danny, and Anna.  It boiled over this morning when Carlos came over with Danny to do some extra tree cutting. We'd negotiated a rate and I had a check already written out. Danny knocked on the door when he was done to get the check and my wife got there while I was in the bathroom. She made a \"joking\" comment to him about already asking for money from the ILs and not even being married yet, and within the hour, I had an enraged call from Anna, and rightfully so.  I argued with my wife about it. It got heated, and I ended up calling her money-crazy, and accusing her of valuing the 150 bucks that today cost over our daughter's happiness. She's convinced that them charging us like \"regular customers\" is the wrong thing to do. More tough words were exchanged, and I ended up refusing to go to our weekly date night until she sent an apology to Danny.  AITA?  &#x200B;  EDIT:  I have some information that's been requested.  First off, what have we provided to Carlos and Danny? I am a cardiologist and I do actually see Carlos' mother regularly. I can't go into details about that but I do everything that I can to keep costs low and get her in where she otherwise might not be able to due to availability, etc.  Second, to the people who think I'm agreeing with my wife or haven't told her to stop, I'd like them to reread the post. I've been telling her to stop. \"Just tell her to stop\" is not the all-solving issue. I've expressed (as clearly as I possibly can) that she's doing wrong and she's putting our daughter in a bad situation. That doesn't mean that I can somehow magically force my wife to do something, physically or otherwise. Two wrongs don't make a right.  Third, I want to make it clear that this is the first time that this has really gotten to Carlos or Danny. I have done everything that I can, up until this point, to stop it. I change the subject when I  think  its heading there. I try my best to express why its wrong (see above), and I also am the sole person who deals with Carlos or Danny at this point. There was the one comment at Christmas, and that happened four years ago.  &#x200B;\n",
      "The other day I was getting ready from work when my oldest daughter (I am a mom of three) came into my room. She said good morning and we talked for a while, which was fine. Then she started complaining about how she had been up late because of schoolwork. She kept complaining about how much she didn't like the school and their teachers, and I was offended.   I work at the school she attends and did not like her negative and ungreatful attitude. I told her this and she tried to make excuses about how the teachers views were outdated and sexist. This was enough for me as I had already asked her to stop, and I told her to go downstairs before she ruined my morning. My daughter started to question my decision, but I pointed at the door and said she had to leave.  I thought the situation was over, but she brought it up again after dinner, saying that my comment of her ruining my morning had been upsetting. I was frustrated that she wanted an apology and told her she would not be getting one because I am allowed to say these things, and think I should. She asked me if I would try to say it more nicely next time. This was disrespectful, and I told her she can't tell me how to speak and that I would likely say the same thing next time.  So, AITA for asking my daughter to go  downstairs? She is seventeen and people won't want to be around her if she doesn't lose the negative attitude.\n",
      "This is a throwaway account because I don‘t want it on my main. My fiance and I got into a fight last night about a Christmas gift he got from my grandparents. They spent about $100 American dollars on a nice, fancy shirt for him. To clear things up a bit, we‘re in a European country, the price of things here are a bit different. You don‘t really get a shirt under about $30. $100 is not as much money as in America but still a decent value of money and a nice gift. I asked him last night if he‘d tried it on or what he did with the shirt (I don‘t remember my exact question.) He said he hadn't tried it on and then he implied he didn't like the pattern so I asked him why he hadn't exchanged it then for something he would like and would fit him. Then we got into the argument.  His view is that this was a gift that is his now and it shouldn't matter what he does with it. He could rip it up in shreds, burn it, throw it in the trash if he pleases or his plan, keep it in the closet and give it away later on. He thinks I was making a way too much big of a deal about „just a shirt.“ and not accepting his point of view (which is true, I am not because I think he‘s being a jerk.)  While I understand that this is his now, I think this attitude is really disrespectful in any case towards the giver. If I give a gift to someone that doesn't suit their preference (color or style) or wouldn't fit them I would want them to go back to the store and get something they actually like and will be using. In the stores here they put an exchange ticket on everything before Christmas so people can return and exchange their presents if they wish to do so. What bothers me the most though and what I would say the whole reason for me making a deal out of this is that this gift came from close relatives and the fact that my grandparents do not have much money. A lot of their savings has gone into medical bills and my grandpa‘s new teeth but they still want to give „valuable gifts.“ It‘s okay he didn't like THIS exact shirt but I feel like he‘s not being grateful for their gesture and kinda of just throwing their money away by not even trying to actually get one he will like and use so their money wasn't wasted.  Is this as simple as „this is his gift now and he can do what he wants with it“ and I am being an asshole for making a deal out of this?\n",
      "Link: https://imgur.com/a/qgzJb3S  Mod deleted a comment and someone asked what the comment said. I posted a link to removeddit so they could see. This was not against the rules (it is now) and I received no warning about not doing that. When I brought it to their attention, they then accused me of back-seat modding. I have no idea what that entails, they give no information about what's considered back-seat modding and the only time I've seen it was when one Redditor told another they couldn't post in that sub because it didn't fit the rules and they were called out for back-seat modding. This isn't the first they've banned people for breaking non-existent rules and have claimed that they've removed those mods. I know that the mods don't  have  to warn you, but banning someone for breaking a non-existent rule and then changing the reason why they were banned just screams power trip. I've also been banned from contacting the mods. Who's the asshole here?\n",
      "On mobile sorry for format.  So I 30 M work an office job 8 until 4  Monday to Friday.  That doesn't give me much spare time to shop. So today after work I called past a big local store called the co op.  They had a huge valentine's display but it was almost empty and they had run out of flower's,  I thought it was absolutely insane that they had run out of flowers and cards by 5pm on valentine's day when they are open until 9!  So I flagged down a girl who worked there and asked if she could get me some roses and a card from the back, she stared at me like I was an idiot and informed me they had sold out around an hour ago.  I was pretty pissed off about this because besides this shop it is 45 mins to my nearest super store and I arranged to meet my gf amy at 6 for dinner.  This girl then had the fucking nerve to say,  I'm sorry but we've been really busy, we even brought extra stock but it all sold, you really need to get flowers the day before or order online. If they brought extra stock they wouldn't have run out, period.  I've never heard of Anyone ordering flower's online for a start, secondly some people have real fucking jobs with real fucking schedules and deadlines.  I said I wanted to speak to the store manager and she then informed me that she was a duty manager and that she would handle any complaint, she looked to be around 16 so I have no idea if she was really a manager or not.  I was getting pretty worked up because I am 100 % convinced they must have still had spare flowers in the back but she refused to even look. And when I approached a different employee and asked them to check she barged in on the conversation and asked me to stop harassing the staff when I was simply requesting some roses and a fucking card. After this I told her she was being a jumped up little bitch she threatened to call the police so I left.  I KNOW I shouldn't have called her that but I can't translate her snarky attitude via the internet.  I had nothing to give my girlfriend for valentine's day and after all this my girlfriend Amy blamed me.  She said I should have brought the gifts sooner and even agreed that I should have got Rose's online.  This was extremely humiliating and embarrassing amy thinks I was an asshole for yelling at the store assistant but being rude to a customer who has a busy job and life and refusing to even walk in to the back to look for the flowers is disgusting customer service in my opinion   AITA\n",
      "Me and my husband come from poor families. No shame in that although my husband would occasionally \"lie?\" About our financial situations and say we own things we don't or buying things we obviously can not afford. His lies don't last eventually which makes not just him look bad but me as well as he'd get me to take part in his lies. He's done this to family members and my own family.  He recently got a job at a respectful company and quickly made friends with classy, well off co workers. He invited his co-workers who are now his friends for dinner at a great restaurant and borrowed money to afford a table. I told him it's useless to act like he's well off and there was nothing to be ashamed of for being poor. He brushed me off and insisted I borrow something nice from my neighbor to wear it to dinner.  I agreed to go but told him if he tried to lie then I won't back him up. He again brushed me off. We arrived at the restaurant and met up with his new friends. Once we sat down he started lying about how much the suit he borrowed from his cousin cost and then lied about the car we came in which was an uber but he lied by pointing at some random car in the parking lot saying it was his and doesnt drive it to work.  I got really uncomfortable with this much lying from him. I kept giving him signs to stop but he doubled down and started talking about where we live. He said we own a house in a known rural area and talked about the garden he grows in the backyard, the pool and the persian furniture. His friend seemed interested when he mentioned persian furniture and said his wife likes it too. His friend asked if they could arrange to visit us in our house which freaked me out because we live in a small rental apartment. I looked at my husband but he looked calm smiled and said he will make it happen. I lost it. I bluntly asked \"what house? We don't own a house we live in a small rental apartment in xxx area\". Everyone went quiet. My husband looked at me shocked. He was speechless but the look in his eyes were saying \"what the heck\". It got so awkward I excused myself to the restroom and my husband followed me.  Once we got away from everyone he blew up asking what was the matter with me. I argued with him about how his lies gotten out of control. He laughed at me saying I was out of my mind to do that and expose him infront of his new friends. I told him he lied about where we live, how did he think he'd cover a lie this big is beyond. He lashed out saying he would've figured something out but now I blew his chances and made him look bad infront of them. I got mad I said I wanted to leave but he said we couldn't leave before them otherwise they'll discover he lied about the car. I told he could wait I was done having to hide who I am as if there's anything to be ashamed of, I apologized to them and left.  He kept arguing after he came home saying I messed up and shouldn't have said what I said and exposed him like that. He's been sulking since then.\n",
      "First off, some backstory. My phone is an old hand-me-down IPhone SE which was my mom’s boyfriend’s old phone before they upgraded to Samsung’s. No problems with that. My Dad (biological, parents are divorced) put it upon himself to put restrictions on my phone (he doesn’t pay for it) that prevent me from viewing NaUgTy WeBsItEs on google. It’s a little annoying but ok. He also put restrictions on mostly everything else, allowing only 2 hours of total use time cumulatively. That’s it. Once that limit is met, the apps brick and I have to ask for time on an individual app for 15 minutes at a time or, if he’s feeling really generous, an hour.  It’s really annoying when I’m listening to music on pandora and I run out of time. Pandora. Is. Restricted. Then I have to go through the arduous task of asking for more time in which case he will either  1.)not get a notification/ignore my request (very common)  2.) ask me why I am wanting to use said app (which is quite frankly none of his damn business) before giving me time (common)  3.) just give me time (maybe 10% of the time)  I honestly feel like I’m inconveniencing him by sending the requests, and he makes such a big deal about me getting time and asking why I want to watch Minecraft let’s plays at 6:30pm that it makes me feel bad for even asking   I need to talk to him about it, and it’s really taxing on my relationship with him. I feel like I’m being punished for nothing, and it’s honestly only going to cause issues if I don’t stop it  TLDR; dad restricted my phone even though he doesn’t pay for it, it makes me mad and I feel like I’m being punished for nothing; should I confront him about it and WIBTA  Edit: I’m 16\n",
      "My (25m) girlfriend (23f) is 7 months pregnant. Before she got pregnant I would have a guys night once or twice every weeek. But now since she is I been doing it maybe once every other week. Last night though the boys to hang put at a bar. I told them yes of course and told my girlfriend i was gonna go later. She had no problem with it then and said it was ok. When I was about to leave she was crying and begging me not to go because she felt sick. I told her she fskt aick all the time because of it and that I have to go. She was still crying but I went anyway. While I was there my phone had died so I wouldn't see anything on my phone because it was dead. When I got in the car I started to charge my phone and I saw a bunch of missed calls from my girlfriend. I called her and told her how sorry I was but she was screaming at me because I was so selfish. I told her I thought that she was selfish for not letting me see my friends. She screamed at me that what if she went into labor but I said that can't happen because its onky been 7 months. She then yelled even more than hung up and told me not to to expect her home for a few days. Im pissed off because I think shes being childish to not let me hang out with my friends for a few hours.  Edit: Idk if people will even see this edit. For people who wete telling me she should break up with me or I should leave for her good I didn't. She has come back and we have both apologized I more than her. We are not breaking up because of my one mistake. Just for if people were curious.🤷‍♂️\n",
      "He said we’d be repaid in 45 days. There have been discussions about repayment but no money has been repaid. It’s been a year plus. He seems to be having money issues. My daughter in law is obssessed with social media & photos of them matching outfits, the whole bit. She insists on a professional photographer at even the smallest events (gender reveal). She had 3 professional maternity shoots, 100’s of pictures. Another when they closed on the house, on and on, Haloween the most recent, it never stops. She also buys props and outfit changes for each. It drives me absolutely insane every time I see another photo. “There goes more of my money”... Why can't a guest be designated to take pictures?  AITA if I call out the thousands of dollars that could have been repaid to us?\n",
      "(We are all 15F)  About a month ago, there was a Billie Eilish concert in my area. I had wanted to see her for a long time, and was supposed to see her just three days after lockdown started two years ago. My friend (we'll call her Elaina) told me about this and I knew immediately that we had to go.  Elaina texted about it in our groupchat, which is me, her, and our other friend (who I'll call Sage). Elaina stressed that we need to go, and she would buy the tickets the next week when presale opened. I texted that I was all in, 100%. On the other hand, Sage said that she didn't want to go at all.   Sage has a lot of problems with her mental health. We figured she needed some space and we were upset that she didn't want to come, but we decided to let her be. Sage said it was fine if we went without her. We reluctantly obliged and started to plan everything without her.  Right before presale opened, Elaina was in the car with her mom. Her mom said she wanted to know for sure that Sage didn't want to come before she purchased the tickets. With her mom there watching her, Elaina texted Sage to make sure that she 100% did NOT want to come. And Sage, once again, said no. We were both sad but wanted to respect her wishes.  Finally, the time of the concert comes, It's me, Elaina, and Elaina's younger sister. We get to the venue and sit down, super excited to see Billie. All of a sudden, we're pinged with a bunch of messages in the groupchat. I open it and see that Sage is going off about how we \"should have forced her to come\" and \"shouldn't have let her sit at home.\" She also said that we didn't check with her multiple times about the tickets, but we did. It made me really upset and I felt so horrible. Elaina was fuming and I tried to help her calm down, but she was screaming about how it was unfair that she said this right before the concert started and made us feel guilty when it was not our fault. Personally, I don't feel it was our fault either. We asked a bunch of times and she still said no. What were we supposed to do? I won't say I wasn't angry, but Elaina was much more mad about it.  Things have been really awkward and although I apologized multiple times things still feel weird. Both Elaina and Sage have been my best friends for years and I don't want there to be any tensions.  So, AITA?\n",
      "This happened back in 2020 but my ex-best friend (15f) randomly texted me (15f) out of the blue today to \"Bring back our friendship\" without even apologizing for this.  We both took the school bus to school, and this school is considered to be a good one that you need to pass an exam to get accepted to. One afternoon after school, a group of kids our age were walking up and down the bus, screaming, \"If you're a dirty jew raise your hand, we gotta finish hitler's job\" and \"I will throw all you swines off of the f***ing bus\". the driver didn't even react, but the worst thing is that my friend \"Samantha\" literally told them that I was a jew. This wasn't my first time facing antisemitism but it certainly was still scary to me. The kids came up to me and starting yelling at me about how I and all Jews are the reason for all the world's problems. I just wanted to cry. My parents helped me report the kids to the school but they didn't get any punishment, just a warning. I cut contact with my friend, but she somehow managed to get my phone number recently.  She just said hey! long time no talk lol how've you been?  I thought that maybe she changed, but then she asked why I cut her off and I told her truthfully. She then told me that I have to learn to take a joke and that I am exaggerating and I was rude to those kids by reporting them.  So reddit, AITA?\n",
      "My mom believes I want to take advantage of my sister and when I told my sister she believed the same... So the graduation of my sister is happening in the end of this July, and she hasn't look deep for dresses or anything, I'm not invited because of the virus is going to be a petit party, but in the first week of August I will have a graduation of a friend, I've been looking a lot for dresses, and today I found this reallyyyyy pretty dress in half the price, and my sister ask me if she can use it and I told her that was alright (we always share clothes), but later I thought for not paying the whole cost of the dress if my sister was going to use it I could share a part of the cost... The dress was 50 usd and I thought I ask her 10 usd, (we don't live in a first world country) and when I told her, she believed, as my mom that I was trying to take advantage... I truly don't see it that way because we have the same salary and she is going to use it first, I've never ask her for money nor her, but I thought it was fair besides for the part that I want to make some adjustments for me after she use it and I don't know if I'm going to have the time... So I'm the a**hole and I should let her borrow it, or is it fair?\n",
      "Before I start some context is I live in a rural area and folks are  usually  pretty friendly around here. I’ve lived here all my life and I’m a white man, I’ve never experienced any trouble and people especially in places like banks and grocery stores are pretty kind and nice to one another.   I was in line at the grocery store and there were 2 or 3 people behind me that I vaguely knew. No one had huge shopping carts or anything as this is a small store.  A girl came up to me, she was African American, and moving very slowly. Despite her color she was very pale and sweating and limping. She asked politely if I minded if she went ahead before me because she had just started her period and was feeling unwell. She looked like she was gonna faint.  She had milk, bread, bananas and sanitary towels and without hesitation I moved back so she could take my spot.  Now the idiots behind me started hollering that they hadn’t said she could cut, I’m physically a large man and turned around and told them to stfu and if they had a problem they could take my spot instead.  Both women immediately went quiet and stated cussing under their breath. It goes without saying they were both white.  I believe they were angry due to discrimination, I’ve seen white women cut the que before and no one blinks an eye, Ive let people cut before, others let it happen, like I say it’s a rural area and folks are usually generous here.   She thanked me profusely as she left and wobbled away out the store.  After she left the 2 behind me started up again, I told em to shut up and paid for my groceries and left.   The clerk who is friends with my wife told her and now my wife is telling me I should have gone to the back of the queue and not made it into a big deal.  Edit: for those asking why I’m bringing race into this, like I said in my OP I vaguely know these people. I’ve seen political stickers on their cars, know what flag they fly outside their home, etc. That’s what formed my opinion that they were huffing over race. I haven’t spoken to either properly but it’s a small town and everyone kinda knows everyone.   Yes they (as in these 2 specific people) have let other people cut before, I wouldn’t usually let someone cut in a different context but in my town it’s the done thing and everyone does it to everyone.   If the internet deems me an asshole that’s cool but between me and God I felt I did the right thing and I’m not mad about it.  That’ll probably be my last update so thanks y’all for taking the time.\n",
      "He had asked if anybody else wanted anything when ordering because he was extremely hungry and really wanted to eat the whole (I must admit, pretty expensive) pizza himself. When the courier arrived, I went down the stairs to open up for him and at that point I opened his box and took out a piece because I didn’t want to ask him for one and i figured he wouldn’t find out as we were all pretty drunk. I then went up the stairs after reorganising the pizza so it looked like a whole one again and gave him his pizza.   The next morning, I told him what I did and he didnt agree with it and said I did him dirty but we could laugh about it. Since then, for different reasons, I brought up that I believed it was mot a morally reprehensible thing to do because if I hadn’t told him he would probably never have found out and because I figured it wouldn’t affect anybodies evening because everyone was pretty drunk. He didn’t actually bring it up, but as I brought it up, he said he thought it would have been better just not too steal it at all. I then reinstated that there was no moral difference between between 1 stealing his pizza and telling him, as he would not have found out if i didn’t tell him. And 2 just never stealing any of his pizza. AITA here? Or is it morally better to not steal his pizza and tell him than to steal it and tell him considering the circumstances?\n",
      "We(9 college young adults) went for a short stay at the beach over the weekend. There were giant floats for rent and most of us were chilling on them on the water while enjoying the sun and breeze.  One of the girls, lets call her Lisa(good friend of my friend, not really close with me), had been constantly splashing me water and giggling away when I told her to stop. She was poking fun at the float I rented, a pink whale, which she said suited me(yeah, I am fat). She then kicked my float repeatedly until it toppled over, and I fell into the water as she laughed. Have to say the sea water was really salty, almost as salty as my feelings.  I swam up to Lisa(guess what, whales can swim!), grabbed hold of 1 end of her jellybean float, and with a sharp twist toppled over her float too. Lisa fell into the water with a scream. That would have been the end of my petty revenge, except that I did not know that Lisa could not swim, and the water was pretty deep there.  With the help of a friend and a stranger nearby we managed to drag Lisa to the shore. She was panicking so hard that she tore the strip on her bikini, and yeah, looked pretty much revealed. She also had makeups on her face which smeared with sea water and tears, guess she never intended to get wet at all. Lisa spent the rest of the holiday indoors and never stepped onto the beach again.  Even though nobody among us openly blamed me for it, I could sense the awkwardness in the air. Lisa completely avoided me and we haven't spoken a word til we parted.  Earlier on the friend who was close to Lisa messaged me and said that I should apologise to Lisa. I am not sure about that. I do feel a little guilty for toppling her float but on the other side, I think she asked for it. AITA?\n",
      "My dad has always believed strongly in the patriarchy and gender roles. He pressured my mom to leave her job to be a stay at home mom, leaving him as the only source of income. She was isolated from her friends and family and was allowed little freedom. He was hostile all the time and  took out his anger on my mom by yelling at her over small things, and usually I would be caught in the crossfire. Then, my dad had an affair. When confronted, he replied all men are like this and it would've been better if she didn't know. He continued his affair while my mom struggled with depression, and even discussed with my mom how flattered he was that woman were interested in him. My mom did not seek divorce because she knew she would be looked down upon in our society, and she would lose custody of me as she was unemployed. My dad has a well-paying job but only gives my mom enough to pay the bills.  My dad's affair continued for 5 years. He does not treat me poorly if I am careful with what I say. However, my mom would always be the butt of his jokes and it’s clear he looks down on her. My mom asks me not to defend her when they argue, because he would accuse her of talking behind his back to me. He was also very unhygienic and I was always afraid of being stuck in the house with him. This evolved into irrational fears and I'm on medication just to live normally.  I aimed for a lucrative degree so I could support my mom if she divorces. Every conversation with him was like walking on eggshells, but I never told him how I felt because I was worried my mom would take the brunt of his anger. We continued pretending like everything was normal.  I turned 18 a few years ago. My dad's affair has allegedly ended but he never apologised to my mom. His temper didn’t improve and my mom says she doesn't care, but I never agreed. Recently, after an outburst from my dad, I told him how much I disliked him for what he has done (with permission from my mom). Though he looked resigned, he still insisted he wasn’t at fault.  While we are stuck in a stalemate, I've been giving him the silent treatment. To give him credit, he has been much friendlier to my mom ever since and she says she is happy. She wants me to see my dad's side and to stop dwelling on the past so we could be a family again. Though he has improved, it's been months compared to decades of emotional turmoil. Just thinking of returning to our facade of a happy family again makes me sick. My mom is not considering a divorce. She tells me that her marital issues do not concern me and that what I'm doing is more for my own petty revenge than for her. I feel conflicted since my mom is the one most affected by him and still thinks this way, but I can’t see myself forgiving him. I feel a bit lost now since my hatred for my dad has influenced how I lived my life. AITA?\n",
      "Anyways, I was on call and we had a difficult case. A patient came in presenting with a bunch of common symptoms. We began the patient on antibiotics with no response.  We had nurses run blood and urine samples. Those came back normal.  Patient was getting worse with no definable reason. A meeting was called and the doctor assigned to the case asked everyone to help figure out what was causing it.  One of my coworkers, who works in psych, said it could psychosomatic. The patient had just gotten back from traveling in a less developed country, perhaps they had an assumption that they'd get sick and their body was manifesting that belief.  It fit with the history and meant they'd likely get better on their own after a sugar pill.  So we went ahead with treatment. They got worse.  They got to the point of not being able to get out of bed due to fatigue.  I go back to my student years and go symptom by symptom to get a differential.  So I suggested to rule out lupus. It's more common than most people think and doesn't always show up on tests.  I got ignored. They continued with sugar pills because it may take time because the patient may have a preconceived idea of how fast treatment should take.  Another day goes by and the patient is still worsening.  Another meeting. I voice again to rule out lupus and am again ignored.  This time instead of being professional I went and told the patient I thought they had lupus and that I was being ignored in favour of treating it as psychosomatic.  The doctor on the case was  pissed  and had me written up. I'm now on administrative suspension and may lose my job. My coworkers are treating me like a pariah and acting as if I was trying to make my coworker look bad.  I know I crossed a line but there wasn't much room for professionalism. I was being ignored. I gave my input twice and was passed over.  So Reddit AITA or not?\n",
      "So I’m 21YOF (who looks a lot younger then that) currently on a sleeper train home (UK). I got on at the starting station and a group of middle aged me are sat in front of me. The seating is like 2 seats and then the others idea is just a single seat. I’m sat in the single seat and clearly not travelling with anyone.   I haven’t had any issues being a lone female the entire trip up until now.   These guys have been drinking vodka and like beer the entire trip which has been since about 21:40. They have been quite like loud but nothing that made me feel unsafe until nowish.   I managed to like half sleep/a light sleep where I could still kinda hear whats going on.  We have stopped at a station for a while now and I took my sleep mask of and have woken up. I brought a blanket with me as I figured sleeper train probably want a blanket. Glad I did. They have made several attempts at like shouting over to me can they have my blanket. Which I shook my head to cos I’m not a big fan of talking to drunk middle aged men.   They then proceed to ask to share my blanket which is uncomfortable. Then like bicker about who I would share my blanket with out of them. (Obvious none of them). Then they were like we can’t get kicked of this train yet were not close to our stop which progressed into what is your stop. One of the guys then said whatever stop shes getting off at. So now am quite uncomfortable because being stalked is not for me. I get they were probably and hopefully joking about that but as a young women who is currently travelling alone I feel like that’s something I should take seriously.   All the seats have reserved like cloths on them so I don’t think I’ll be able to easily move.   I thinking about trying to discreetly speak to a train staff about it but I’m not sure they’ll take me seriously and think that might be blowing this out of proportion. So would I be the asshole if I did that?\n",
      "It was my mom's birthday. We went out for dinner to our favourite restaurant. I was feeling pretty down the whole night.   After food, we continue talking for a while. Mom had drank a lot of wine that night and was considerably drunk. She began speaking about what she wanted to better herself in. Mom's always been talking about going on walks everyday and being fit but her busy job usually gets in the way. She says how she wants to go on walks everyday and better her body and fitness and says I should go with her too. I was on a diet to a lose a bit of weight so I jokingly questioned \"why me?\"  She smirked at me and goes \"your fitness is really bad\". Of course it is, I know this but it felt mocking coming from her and I was hormonal. She keeps talking about my fitness and how bad it is. My brother being an ass chimes in too. After talking so much I tell my family, I feel hugely offended by them talking about my fitness and to stop. It wasn't about my body but my fitness but it felt more about my body.   My family keeps talking about it though, my middle brother says we should race to see who's more fit and mom entertains this. She says I wouldn't be able to run the length better than her. She tells me to be honest with myself. I've clearly stated I'm uncomfortable and my oldest brother and dad have picked up on this aura I was giving off. I really thought my mom was calling me fat. Even when I was trying to lose weight I felt like she was still mocking me. They keep going on about it, my eyes fill with tears.  My oldest brother notices first, asks if I'm okay. I just nod. Mom is still going on with it. Until, I just cry. Everyone seems shocked by this, but my middle brother finds joy and laughs at me. My dad tells mom to stop already. That's when mom finally says \"how dare you ruin my birthday\".  And I sob. My oldest brother scolds her and I go to the toilet.  My family has left and I go out to the car park alone. The feeling is stiff. Middle brother is making jokes about it. I go to my bedroom.  An hour later, I stand at the top of the stairs and I listen, mom and dad fighting about tonight. Mom is in no way apologetic and calling me rude for causing a scene, dad says I'm only a teenager and says what she was saying was taken in the wrong way, mom says it's not about what I thought because that's not what she was actually saying and I should see it her way. My oldest brother hears this fight too, tells me I can talk to him about everything. My dad comes in later.   Later in the night, mom and dad fight in their room about me again. I turn up the music and just lay back. I go to the park at 11pm that night to tell my friend.  The next day I put it behind me, no apology or anything but I pretend it never happened. I ask mom to buy my favourite bands new CD, she says we'll do it tomorrow.  Later, dad comes into my room. Says mom's not over the thing about her birthday and mom won't buy me the CD. So dad buys me it.   AITA?\n",
      "I (23f) have a coworker (27f) from a foreign country. We have been working together for 3 months. We are not friends as she doesnt mix with everyone only a select few. Which is fine, she is not pressured. However the everyone else is a part of a bigger friend group. All of whom hang out often and go on outings, whether it be parties, road trips or just casual hangs ( we are from the caribbean so the culture is very friendly and people oriented)   The company has an outing this weekend. Which she was refusing to attend with reasons like she has no clothing, the bus ride will be too long, she doesn't wanna go on a boat, what will she do when the reaches the island, she doesn't like the people in attendance,she doesnt wanna hike etc.  I had offered to take her to buy clothing as I drive and can find things that are cheap as it's my home country.  But she refuses saying she hasn't made up her mind.  So we dropped the issue stating she has to make up her mind if shes coming and stop going in circles.   But the problem is every two hours she approaches me asking if I'm going on the trip. Admittedly I was already annoyed so I responded with \"for the 50th time yes I am. Please stop asking me. Are you going\" to which she responded that she doesn't know. Saying her problem was that if she schedules a pick up from the company vehicles she will be there at 6( we leave at 7) and she doesn't want to sit and wait for one hour.   At this point we already told her if she doesn't want to use the company vehicles, she can use a local taxi, or ask one of the dozen managers from her staff house for a ride. All of the options which she refuse.   She asked if I can pick her up. My response was \"No. I'm not going to pick you up. You're not going to jump in my car when it's convenient for you and out of my way for me\". I said this for a few reasons:   In the first month of her being here and constant complaining I have offered to give her rides many many times to places she was having a hard time finding or for things she needed but she always refuses saying she doesn't want a ride from me. She rather go with the company vehicle. Which is fine. I mean we just met and the country is foreign to her. But she would constantly approach me and complain instead of trying to help herself. We have tried to include her in the bigger group of activities but she always refuses (which again is fine) but you can't expect us to now go out of our way to help.  Her approach to life irritates me. Her permanent mode is complaining and not looking for solutions. She expects  everyone else to offer a solution. Which she then turns down and continues complaining.    Anyways, after I said no she got upset (because apparently she has no other options) and now the rest of coworkers are saying I'm an asshole.  AITA?\n",
      "My mom (72F), has always been judgmental about my (37F) overall looks and weight. In 2003, I developed chronic pain disorders and was misdiagnosed for10 years, gained 115lbs due to medications/surgeries regardless of exercise/eating. After proper diagnosis, I was told I would have issues losing weight.  I married in 2013 and stayed in the abusive relationship for almost 10 years. Before Covid, I lost 75lbs. I got to a M/L or 10/12 (5'7\"). During Covid, I gained 25lbs. Towards 11/2021, I was again losing weight. Until I moved in with my parents.  I have told my mom dozens of times over the years to leave me alone about my weight and looks. She has been extremely hurtful my entire life regarding what she perceives as ugly (an extra 5lbs in HS, not wearing makeup, etc), and she is aware. We have had huge fights about the way she treats me before, and I have reminded her recently to keep her thoughts to herself.  Friday, I receive this text: \"I just had a fun memory flashback....probably a year after your surgery and we were in my bedroom trying on different size pants and when they fit we were hysterical laughing with joy!! Do you remember the feeling!!! So much satisfaction! So much pleasure! Success. Just a sweet memory. Maybe we can challenge each other again?\"  Again? I work out with Apple+ (dance classes) and have invited her to join me. She declines. I told her that while this is a cool memory, I didn't need her bringing up memories as an obvious excuse to chastize me for my weight. I told her I do not feel supported at all by her, that she puts me down all the time for my looks, that I would NOT tolerate forcibly micromanaging my diet/judging me/shaming me and that it isn't \"challenging\" me and I won't participate; but mutually beneficial motivation and support is great.  She says it sounds to her I'm not on board to lose weight if I want to continue having 600 calories every day in cookies (false) and that she hoped I would be tired of being fat after a while, that my exercising would lead to better habits. She can’t help if I don’t want help. She then says she gained weight but not all of it back and falsely claims she watches her diet. I said I was losing weight before I moved in and she responds, \"Still or have you gained?\" I said I had nothing to prove to her, \"F*ck you for being so judgmental and acting like I am such a disappointment to you. Go to hell.\"  She answered by dismissing me, \"You will feel sorry when you let it continue.\" I said, \"You are a judgmental, rude, ignorant, unsupportive, b*tch, and you need to go to therapy.\" She then guilted a friend into talking to me for her, and said I can't expect to find an attractive man to want me if I am fat. I can't believe I don't have an ED.  I am not going to apologize. Not for cursing nor standing up for myself. She thinks I am rude. I don't feel that curse words are profane. What I find profane is a mother so intent on tearing down her own daughter. Why did she even have one?  So... AITA?\n",
      "(throw away account cause I feel uncomfortable with my friend knowing of my account and stuff)  Ok, so EXPOSITION TIME, please read tho for context:  &#x200B;  I go to university, and I spend long hours and work pretty hard. A regular day is from 9 to 5 and that doesn't account for travel time.  I get that everyone has to deal with their struggles, but my point is, is that I'm exhausted by the end of an average day. Recently I . just got of Christmas break which wasn't much help as I just studied and worked the whole time, but we got assigned a lot of projects.  &#x200B;  Anyway, the first day back I was feeling irritable and tired as it had been a tough day. I stayed later than usual and the traffic was horrendous, I also have a trapped nerve in my back and it made working hard. I was meeting up with my friend and my father for dinner ( I met my friend through my dad and we became very close, she's a senior lady)and she's got a few of dogs. One of them is not quite the ticket and had not been trained (Pepe)  We think he'd been spoiled his whole life, and always got food whenever he barked for it, cause that's exactly what he does, he barks and barks and barks until he gets what he wants, basically And when we try and eat dinner he'll bark so loud I'll sometimes get a headache and have to put him in another room, but that won't stop him.  &#x200B;  I don't blame people for behaving the way he does like I said he was never trained, and I do feel bad for this guy, he was made stray for a few weeks after his original owner died.  so anyway, this Monday I was feeling like shit from having a really bad day and went over to her house at around 7.  Now Pepe was particularly yappy that day and it was getting on my nerves a bit, I had a pounding headache and i just wanted him to stop. There are some days where he begs for food so much that if you stand up, he'll think you're going into the kitchen and just immediately start barking and will not stop unless you give him what he wants.  He was following me around a lot in particular because I was helping cooking and setting the table. my friend was sitting down just watching this the whole time, And several times I told him off, the usual \"Pepe, NO.\" sternly.  It came to such a bad point. that my head was pounding bad, the barking was getting to me. I was trying to drink some tea and he was just watching me yapping his head off. I finally just had enough and started raising my voice yelling at him to go away several times but as usual to no effect. (picking him up didn't help he just tried to get away) Anyway, the next day my dad who was there, told me that me yelling at her dog upset her. she is very protective and I probably should have known better, but my dad told me I was in the right and that he needs to be told.  I was pretty harshly stern (not aggressive, but just slightly below that) in the way I yelled and I'm not sure how Pepe is going to see me form this point on.  AITA?\n",
      "My roommate A[20F]  and I [21F] have been planning an end of term barbecue to celebrate finishing a gruelling summer term. We invited a bunch of our friends (aged 20-25) and are borrowing a bbq from one of them, let’s call him C[21M]. Since we are borrowing C’s bbq, we decided to invite his roommate R[21M] along as well.   I’ve known C for about 3 years and he is one of my best friends. I’ve known C’s roommate R for about a year, and though we have had our differences I consider ourselves fairly good friends. R and C are very good friends.  R has recently had his long term distance girlfriend move across the country to live with them. I have only met her once and she seems very nice. I told R he could bring her along to the party as well since they are living together and I wouldn’t want her to be left home alone while her bf and roommate are gone to a party. I also know she loves partying and is an avid drinker, something I have no problem with.  This brings me to my dilemma, C has recently informed me that R’s gf is only 17 years old. The drinking age in my country is 19 years old. I’m kind of uncomfortable with having an underage girl drinking and partying in my home as if something would happen I would be liable. My roommate A feels the same way.  My friends group is split on the matter. Some of them understand where we are coming from, but others say we are treating her unfairly, treating her like a child and being disrespectful of R’s “adult relationship”. I know the gf has had a hard upbringing and had to grow up fast, but she is still 17 and I would legally be responsible for her in my home.  So AITA for treating my friends girlfriend like a child and telling her she’s welcome to join but she is not allowed to drink/smoke at my home?\n",
      "Keeping this somewhat vague to protect my identity.  I (16f) recently had a friend (16f) end up in the hospital. I won’t state exactly what was wrong. However, she was diagnosed with a lifelong condition that is 100% treatable as long as she takes her medication as directed. As long as she takes her medicine every day, she shouldn’t be affected by her condition anymore.  She was checked in to the hospital around 1am, and her mother (~45, I don’t know her exact age) and brother rode with her to the hospital in an ambulance. This means neither of them had their cars. She lives around 45 minutes away from me. They were originally taken to a hospital near their house, but she was transferred to a different hospital that had a specific type of specialist that she needed. The new hospital was about ten minutes from my house.  Now, I would like to say a few things at this point in the story.     I am a relatively new driver, having only driven for a few months. I’d never given someone a ride before this, apart from taking my friends places (which I don’t really consider giving a ride since we were both going to the same place to have fun.) My parents never really instructed me on etiquette for this situation.    This girl is one of my closest friends. I’ve known her since we were 12, and I tell her everything.    This was about a 30 mile round trip, and between an hour and an hour and a half of my time (this was a few weeks ago at this point so I don’t remember exactly).    I had zero intention of asking for money.    Anyways, because they didn’t have their car, my mom told me to go pick up my friend’s mom and drive her to her house. I don’t know if friend’s mom asked or if my mom offered. In any case, I was woken up at  9am (it’s summer) and told to be at the hospital by 9:45. I showered, stopped for coffee on the way, and was there on time. Friend’s mom got in.  We drove to her house, making some small talk and talking about friend’s condition. I pulled up in front of their house. I told her that if she needed anything else to call me. She asked if I needed gas money, I said something along the lines of “if you don’t mind, you don’t have to.” She gave me $20, we said our goodbyes, she went inside. Honestly, even immediately after I felt kind of bad.  When I got home, I found out that my mom and her mom had been talking about it, and friend’s mom joked that I “made $20 today” and that she was “expecting me to say no”. It honestly just made me feel really guilty and uncomfortable, and my mom ended up sending the money back via Venmo.  My mom ended up telling me that I probably shouldn’t have taken the money, but that friend’s mom shouldn’t have sent the texts.  TLDR: AITA for taking gas money that was offered to me during a difficult time for a friend’s family?  Edit: My mom only told me not to take the money because it was an emergency in this case. She was 100% on my side otherwise. She only sent the money back because I felt uncomfortable.\n",
      "I'm (a F teenager) angry and i don't trust my mom anyomore for never taking something serious seriously.  For example a month ago or two i saw that my cat had problems with peeing, also was peeing with blood, i told my mother about that and she didn't want to take her to the vet (you don't want to hear her excuses REALLY) (we had the money, and if necessary i would use my money) i was really scared that something could happen to my cat so i told my dad and other family members ( i didn't want to told my dad before because he takes things TOO SERIOUSLY, and when i do that they always fight) my mom and dad fighted and my mom blamed me and didn't treat me well, y'know what i mean. We taked the cat to the vet now she has a urinary problem and needs special food for life.The drop that spilled the glass is that she doesn't want to take me to the doctor because i didn't have my period FOR FOUR MONTHS, i don't have regular periods because i didn't end my developing so it should be around one or two months MAX, but my doctor said if i didn't have a period for more than 3 months i should go for a revision because that never means something good, but my mom still doesn't want to take me because \"you maybe don't remember if you had another period in those four months and blah blah blah\" i can't bring that topic again because she gets angry and yells at me. I'm scared that is something wrong with me and i just want to go to the doctor to be sure or maybe i don't need to care like she does.Many other things happened that she didn't take seriously  and never end well, even my dad said to her that \"YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT NOTHING, EVERYTHING IS THE SAME FOR YOU!\". I have more examples like:I have problems with my feet and i need orthopedic templates with good shoes (i can't use sandals and those types of things) the doctor said that i need to use them most of the day because if not the problems i already have with my spine could go even worse, but my mom doesn't let me use them in the house because \"you don't walk here and BLAH BLA BLA\" and yells at me if i'm using my shoes in the house ( i told my dad about this but things didn't change really).I'm also a bit angry because i don't have much privacy, like she takes my phone in secret and sees all the messages that i send with my friends (i don't have many friends and rn i feel really alone and this just doesn't help, i feel like i can't talk about nothing with the few friends i have, i used to be a very happy person and liked to talk with everyone and be friend of everyone but i feel like i just can't talk to anyone now because my mom would see it and judge me, also i have many fake friends that just despreciate me and make me feel very bad) Am i the asshole for being angry with her?(I thought that i may be the asshole because when i try to solve the problem i cause a fight betwen my mom and me/my dad). Sorry for the very bad english\n",
      "I'm  M(32), Been working at this company 7 years.  I'm sort of like an engineer/analyst/manager and I'm heavily involved in everything from supporting sales people to managing product development. I've been told I'm being considered for promotion in the near future. I'm going to FINNALLY be officially recognized as part of actual management. This is huge for me since I'm the only one working. I have no degree, but I make about 70k a year and my wife F(33) stays chooses to stay home with our 2 kids (she has an associates degree and is able bodied). With house prices and food being what they are its been difficult. So I REALLY need to kiss some ass and get this promotion.  So that being said, there is a new product launch happening. I work remotely but I'm near the factory we make or will make the product. My boss, his boss, and the Higher ranking sales people are flying in to see and discuss the product. My boss wants me to meet them for a corporate dinner after a sales training/meeting at the factory. So I can meet his boss and upper management who have flown in. Mostly because everyone happens to be here (he lives in an entirely different city and the sales people live in different states throughout America).  I've told my wife that I need to attend this dinner on Monday, and then go physically to the factory the next day and train people during the day and evaluate some software we are developing to accompany our product. She is PISSED that she isn't invited to this dinner, She claims I don't love her and other men wouldn't do this to their wives. My being physically at the factory is also preventing her from getting some pictures taken of one of our kids (she won a photography thing) That she wants me to drive her to. She is unwilling and uncomfortable driving downtown and would rather me do it. But these pictures are scheduled to be taken 1:30 pm to 3pm during working hours. (normally not as issue because I work from home and can drive places during the day if I need to.  She is now blowing me off and acting as if I'm conspiring to make her miserable. I've told her that this seems really unreasonable and asked her why she is acting this way? I do not understand why is she not supporting me in this, it seems very unfair that I'm the only one working and doing what I'm asked to do makes me a bad person apparently.  Her response was to accuse me of narcissism for questioning her actions. She's told me that \"it isn't normal and there are men out there who wouldn't do this to their family\".  Am I the asshole?\n",
      "AITA?? A bit of context, I 23F and my husband 26M invited a friend to live with us in a free room we have since he was living with his mom and was feeling awkward as he is 27M about a year ago.   At first he helped us beside the rent with the groceries and other services we have to pay at home. He has a part time job and sice he was in prison before he can't get like a well pay job, in the other hand we get a good average of money monthly since we both work full time and my FIL help us with some money monthly since he is well paid and do not have much to pay monthly. Well my husband and I do not mind whenever he has to pay the rent late or cannot help with the services ( gas, electricity, water, internet etc) however since a cooler of months back he stoped helping with the groceries I do not mind at all if I cook give him some food since I do not want food to get waste or him to be hungry BUT I'm a picking eating person and some days I just want to eat sandwiches the hole day or just eat cereal with milk or eat quesadillas the whole day etc. Also I am lactose intolerant and I have to boy special cheese and milk. Lately I have notice that the food I buy just for me that not even my husband touch bc he knows how I am regarding eating has been desapearing and I'm not the one who is eating it, then I discovered was our Friend as one morning I woke up craving a sanding and the last cheese and ham I had was gone! And he was eating it before going to work. I didn't told him anything at the moment but I was really mad at him. I told my husband and he was so sweet of going to the super and get me more then he marked all out food at DO NOT TOUCH and his name also I stop cooking for him this whole week and only making a small amount of food for my husband only. I haven't seen him in the whole week and I think he  is mad at us but Ido not care I am a really nice person but even if he has a part time job and he does not earn too much I'm not his mother to pay for his food as well. So Reddit IATA?? Sometimes I feel like that.  Edit: I talk to him last night and express how I was feeling and he agree to bring some groceries and do not eat the items are marked as mine. Ty all for your advices\n",
      "I got married last year and I can really understand how frustrating it can be when people are no-shows especially when you're paying per head and have requested RSVP's. I'm not one of the hosts but I've been helping out with my friends bridal shower as the hosts were really busy and needed help. They are making name plates for everyone and specialized guests favors as well as paying per head at the venue. The price per head is $52 (that they pay upfront with a 48 hour cancellation), favors, $11, name plates, probably about $2. They are also playing games and have pre-arranged the teams so people mingle. They requested an RSVP 1 month ago and the shower is this upcoming weekend. I'm responsible for putting the favors together and getting the name plates printed at a custom shop. The shower is from 10 am to 2:30 pm, we're brown and have morning weddings that usually go from 9 am to 1:30 pm.  &#x200B;  My other friend who RSVP'd yes, told me Friday that she has a wedding that day and wont be able to make it, I told her she should let the guests know because it's a 48 hour cancellation so they can get back to money they spent on her and re-organize accordingly. She said that she'll just go to the wedding and make it in time for the shower even if she only makes it for the last half hour. I explained to her that she can let them know, so they don't have a spot for the seated dining because it's pretty expensive. She told me that she would, and I left it. Today the hosts and I were confirming the guest list, and her name was on it, I asked them if she had msgd them at all and they said no. I texted my friend to ask her to let them know, she said that they could save her her plate and  she'll drop by the brides house after the shower to grab her food (from a 5 course seated brunch) and drop off the gift.   &#x200B;  I let the hosts that she told me she wont be able to make it but will drop by at the brides house after, they texted her (while I was there) to confirm if she can make it, she told them she can't but will drop by after, they let her know that they can't just save her a plate so they will cut her out from the shower itinerary and just save her the party favors that are already made. My friend is now pissed off at me because I went behind her back and told them.  &#x200B;  AITA?\n",
      "My gf doesn't have Reddit so this is her:  So today I was really upset and It was very clear I was upset. I was nearly crying and not speaking to anyone. I was even in a separate group in the sport we were playing even though we could chose your groups but they didn't bother to even ask if I was okay or talk to me at all. They pretty much just pretend I wasn't there but then whenever I hang around my boyfriend (who actually asks if I'm okay and supports me) they get all mad at me because \"oh you're ditching us for him?\"  If I had a choice, I would chose my boyfriend over my friends. Does that make me an asshole?\n",
      "So my husband (m26) and I (f26) were coming back from our family trip from Costa Rica. We had a layover in Miami. We had to pass TSA again to get to our connecting flight. We had about a two hour layover. The TSA line was very long and my husband doesn’t have a lot of patience for waiting. It’s been a problem in our relationship because he always blows up for waiting. The guy who was helping people put things in the bins was taking his sweet time and looks so confused with things. So at this point my husband was pissed. I was putting my shoes and stuff in the bin while was husband already pass the metal detector. For some reason the guy at tsa moved my bin to a different machine and didn’t tell me. I had already passed the metal detector and was waiting for all my bags. When all my husband stuff and bags came out we didn’t see my bag. A lady told us the guy was moving bags to different machines. So I went around looking for my bag. My husband at this point was so mad he started yelling and cursing. I told him to calm down because he was going to make things worst. He then went up to a TSA agent and asked where my bag was. The guy said idk and went to look but my husband started yelling at him and cursing so the guy stopped looking and told him to F off. I turned to my husband (now I was mad) and I yelled at him to go away because he wasn’t helping the situation but making it worst and I’ll deal with it. He got mad and walked away. I asked the agent again nicely about my bag and he found it. Once I got my stuff I went to meet him by the gate and he started yelling at me for yelling at him in front of everyone. He said how I never let him handle situations how he wants and I made him look bad. He went on to say that I can never ask him for help when things like this happens to me because I always make him look bad. I told him I understand and I won’t ask him. My comment made him even more mad and now he’s not talking to me and wants me to apologize for making him look like less of a man. So AITA for yelling at him and saying what I said?\n",
      "Yesterday some friends were over at my (27, F) house. For game reasons, we needed to move my plant shelf away from the window so I could close the blinds. My friend Joe (27, M) asked if I wanted help, and I didn't say yes or no because I was still assessing the best way to move the shelf (The plants are on a bookcase with loose shelves that separates into two parts in the middle. I really don't want my plants to fall so I'm being cautious)  Joe gets up and I tell him \"no\" repeatedly (I might have also said \"stop\" or even \"wait\" but I think that multiple \"no\" should have been good enough).  He starts moving the shelf while I continue to protest.   He reassures me that he knows what he's doing.  The shelf starts to come apart, because he is lifting it from just the top part.  I yell a singular \"STOP!\" at him. Very loudly and angrily.   He stops lifting, but everyone is mad at me for yelling. Joe says that yelling is a bad way to communicate, and says that I shouldn't be upset because I asked for help in the first place. I never asked for help, he offered and then started helping before I responded.  I explain what actually happened to everyone, Joe agrees with my story, and I think that's that. We play our game (skeletons, like reverse DnD where you pretend to guard a tomb instead of raiding it)   I thought that Joe understoond what he did wrong, but it came up again today in conversation and he says I still wasn't communicating effectively and instead of saying \"No\" I should have said \"stop\" or \"wait\". I'm pretty sure that I used an assortment of words to tell him to stop, but I honestly don't remember. Whatever I said it wasn't complete sentences, whiich I get would have been better, it just takes me a while to gather my thoughts to speak.  Either way, I think I'm right and I feel like I'm going insane. Moving a shelf should be such a small thing I don't know why it has to be an argument, and why he's digging his heels in about it. Is he right? Am I the Asshole?\n",
      "My thoughts and feelings are everywhere right now because I'm pissed so I might be a bit all over the place.  A few days ago my brother (22) told me that his girlfriend (23) is pregnant. They have known since October but didn't want to tell anyone. Besides her parents, I was the only one that knew. The next day he told our other brother. He didn't tell our mom because 1) she can't keep a secret and 2) you never know how she's going to react to things. He asked both me and our other bro not to mention it, and of course we didn't.  So yesterday he finally told her and now the whole day today has been my mother bitching at all of us, saying how he is rude and selfish to not tell her as soon as they knew. She said she has the right to know. I'll give her that...she does have the right to know. But I ignored her texts about it because I figure it's their baby, their business and they can tell whoever they want whenever they want. Anyway, he told her not to say anything to anyone or post about it on facebook and she said okay.  I thought that was the end of it but tonight my husband, my other brother, and I were helping my parents move some stuff. She went on and on about how brother with the pregnant girlfriend was selfish for having a baby when she doesn't live in the same state as them and how she is more excited for the baby than he is. She then said that she talked to our grandparents and our uncle and aunt (who are due around the same time as bro and gf) about it. It pissed me off, as I thought it wasn't her place to tell them and I told my brother what she said.  He went off on her and she came to me saying that I shouldn't have \"tattled\" on her. That I just wanted to stir up shit and cause drama because I am resentful of her and I want everyone to be miserable. She said he doesn't trust her and is mad at her because of me. I told her no, you promised not to tell anyone and you still did...You broke the trust, not me. She called me an asshole, said I act like a child, and said I'm selfish. She keeps telling my brother that I told him because I wanted to create hate and that I want to drive people apart. She said it wouldn't hurt him if he didn't know that she said something.  My brothers are both on my side, and say if she wants to be trusted, she should've honored their wishes. I didn't want to hurt my brother at all, and I don't want there to be any tension between everyone. But the things she said didn't sit right with me, and she is known to talk about us to each other. We always tell each other the things she says.  Still, I can't help but feel guilty. That maybe I should've just let it go and ignored her. What do you think, AITA?  Edit (already!) just to add that now she has asked my brother if she can talk to her sister about it because she has no one to talk to now that we are all in the \"I hate mom group\". I know this doesn't add anything, just thought it was hilariously ridiculous.\n",
      "Let me start this off by saying that this is a throwaway, and my last post gives quite a bit of insight into my current situation. I'm sorry that I couldn't reply to everyone at the time, but I am taking the advice to heart.   A few nights ago my husband happened to be off from work so we decided to order pizza (while the cousin/roommate was at work). I didn't think much of it at the time, but we were really enjoying our \"date night\" and ended up finishing the whole thing. As it got close to time for her to get off from work, we steeled ourselves for the impending confrontation. Not 5 minutes after she walked through the door, she started complaining about how inconsiderate we were for not leaving her any.   Here's where I should explain that this happens  constantly . She rarely ever offers to pitch in for the cost of food, and I don't feel obligated to make sure she has leftovers. We aren't her parents, after all.   AITA for being inconsiderate?\n",
      "Home inspector came, I was sleeping, I let my boyfriend know I was gonna nap through it. Last time they were here I was home alone, so I just watched and chatted with them while they went through the house. Asked questions on if there was anything I needed to do, if they wanted water, if everything looks okay. Just basic small talk. But I watched them to make sure I knew exactly where they were going to make sure they didn’t have any sticky fingers or anything else.   So today happened. I told him to do what I did to keep ourselves safe from any possible weird wacky bullshit. At most, just keep an eye on them DONT even chat if it’s too much.  Well; I woke up to the inspectors. Who were all ALONE walking throughout the house. Apparently they needed two people for this for  once.  So when they left I was furious and told my boyfriend he’s such a dickhead for not watching him. Because they worked specifically in the bedroom hallway I was sleeping at (how lucky)  Now I don’t know if it’s just a family thing for me, but we NEVER let strangers into our home without keeping a close eye on them. Anything could happen from them having a heart attack to them wanting to steal. Stranger danger type of deal. It also feels impolite to let someone into your house then just sit in the couch like you don’t exist.  I’m pissed off my boyfriend defended himself with “I thought the door was locked” and “I told you when they were coming!”  I was fine with everything until I knew he wasn’t watching JUST IN CASE. Yes, I do have some traumatic history when it comes to strangers and he KNEW THAT. He knows how I really really struggle with paranoia, my home was the one place that felt safe and now I lost that because I don’t know what they could’ve done. Did they map the layout in their heads to eventually rob us? Well I would’ve known if he did the thing he’s usually good at, which is helping me confirm that I’m safe.   I trusted him to keep an eye out for me and he failed. He sat back on the couch and played video games.\n",
      "EDITL: clarification  (TLDR: Friend interrupts me multiple times, I respond angry, get told I'm the asshole.)  I met up with my friend (I will refer to them as Alice) and we had a good chat, they made jokes I made jokes. It was a positive interaction, until we get to the bike rack. Alice start asking about finals and if I'm prepared, then while I'm answering they interrupt with a unrelated topic. I tell them to shut up as most friends do, but when they interrupt again I say shut up in a way to send the message that I was upset. And when I start talking Alice started mouthing the words and explained it as \"Taking shut up literally\" and keep going. Thinking I was to aggressive somehow I ask her to please stop and when Alice doesn't I storm off before not so nice words are exchanged.  After explaining the situation to some friends they say along the lines of \"Just let them talk\" and \"That was rude\" (<- toward me). I just genuinely want to know, am I the asshole?\n",
      "(There was another post like this a while back, this is basically like that but toned down a lot. Props to them for sticking through their experience)  I have always hated my sister. She somehow manages to be everything I hate combined. She loves herself, talks shit behind peoples backs, can't do anything by her self even though she could.   Attention whoring   She vacums up my parents attention like me eating some chicken. She thrives in it. I am so overshadowed because she needs So. Much. Care/attention for the smallest things.  Whenever my family all sits down to eat, she launches into one of her BS stories (making her seem like the victim when she initially antagonized the other person, finding ways to shit talk other people) and my parents eat it up! They are so caring and stuff when I can't share my opinion with out my sister making a pouty face then my parents tell me to be quiet.   Judging   My sister loves to judge people for minding their own damn business. Earlier today she said exactly \"those people who just sit at starbucks talking should go away. I need to sit there too people! Go find a different place to sit!\" Remember what I said about her stories? She always finds a way to add in a snarky comment about ___ being ugly or their opinion being wrong. She comments on people walking by as we go through public places   in ah,  unkind ways  for no reason besides.. well actually I don't know why.   Whining   I know this is simular to attention whoring but it would be super long.  My sister acts so fragile all the time. She  needs  food NOW or  needs  to sit down and rest NOW! When she doesn't get her way, she starts whimpering and groaning louder and louder until you can't take it anymore. She complains about anything and everything, and demands it. Its obviously taking a toll on my parents but she doesn't care.  But here's the problem. My parents have said that she has a mental illness that she even takes meds for and she goes to a therapist. The thing is, they have not told me exactly what the illness is. I can't tell if I am being a piece of shit or not because I don't know how much the illness affected her, is she being controlled by something the can't reach or is she just an asshole?

      "Title is condensed. Alt acc. On mobile. I don't consent to this being posted to any other platform.  Cast: Me22F, SO23M, His mom(MIL)40sF  SO and I have been together for 3 years, living in a Southern state for college. Throughout, I have been very entwined with my SO's family. I lived with them for a time, and in a rental property, MIL owns. She and I had a very wonderful relationship at the start.  A lot of life stuff happened around Summer of 2019. MIL coped by steadily increased her alcohol intake from a glass per night to multiple bottles. Her behavior started changing too. She often talked badly of SO to me, and it started several fights between me and him. She would make little comments here and there that belittled me, she would say one thing and then deny it and call me a liar. Anytime someone called her out on something she did, she would play the victim and we ended up apologizing to her.  I recognized she was going through a lot at this point in her life, but I didn't feel comfortable saying anything because \"Until I have a ring on my finger, I dont have a say in this family\" as I have been told.  My breaking point was my dog. All was well until March 12 this year. The dog Ive had since I was 11, got out while I was at work. It was about 4 hours before SOs family realized she was gone, and by then she was already dead. I was devastated. She was the first pet I ever had and she still had a lot of life in her. 3 days later, my SO made a marker for her grave and I came over to pick it up. MIL was discussing getting a new dog to replace MY dog. I broke down in tears, left, and didn't speak to her for a month.  Right before moving back to my home state, I wrote her a letter to explain why our relationship became so fractured. I wanted us to be on the same page, and I was as open and honest as possible. I started and finished it saying I loved her and want the best and hope we can have a good relationship in the future. (I saved a copy of it on my phone. It was about 5 pages on paper so it won't fit the character count for my post)  I literally handed it to her, left the house, and moved to my home state the next morning. We haven't spoken since. My SO and I are long-distance till December, but Im scheduled to visit next weekend.  SO and MIL work together, and SO just called me saying his boss doesn't like me because of the letter I wrote. Apparently, MIL showed it to him and denied everything, boiling it down to me being disrespectful. Thing is, SO read the letter before I gave it to MIL and approved it, which he cleared up with his boss. I told SO in light of this I dont want to stay at their house during my visit. I wanted no malice in our relationship, I was as honest as I could have been, and she goes off and bad mouths me to who knows how many people, denying everything.  AITA for even giving her the letter? Or not wanting to see her during my visit? WAS I being disrespectful? I am ready to accept my judgement.\n",
      "In a few years I’m going to graduate and my grandmother (dads side) has distanced herself from our family we were supposed to have a reunion for my brothers graduation but she decided not to go due to her being upset with my aunt who wasn’t even going because of her new child and she even missed my aunts child’s birthday because of her differences I saw this as a dick move but if you see otherwise please inform me also my parents and my grandma don’t have a great relationship.So reddit am I the asshole?\n",
      "Throw away, boyfriend knows my main.  Me (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been together for just under a year. Since the start of when we were together, I've been on the pill and we've always used condoms. Unfortunately both methods failed and now I'm pregnant.  I have told my boyfriend from the start that I would probably get an abortion if I got pregnant, but told him that I was not 100% as I could not be certain how I would feel at the time and I didn't want him to feel like I lied to him. He on the other hand has always told me that he fully wanted me to get an abortion if I got pregnant. I never once told him that I would get an abortion, just \"probably\" or \"maybe\" whenever he asked.  Now that I am pregnant I really do not think that I can go through with an abortion due to a variety reasons. I feel as if I will regret it and feel guilty for the rest of my life if I do.  He is not happy with my decision. He says that I am ruining his life by doing this when he is just about to start at law school and I'm in college. The thing is I go to a college very close to home and my parents are very well off. As my mother really does not want me to get an abortion (though she would support me if I did), her and my father have agreed to take care of 100% of the expenses of the baby while we both finish college. They have said that they are ok with him paying no child support until he has a stable job, or if we stay together they will help support the child until we both have a place of our own and jobs. My mother doesn't work so she can take care of the baby when I have classes (she loves babies and is very excited for this).  He is still upset. He says that he still wants to be a part of the baby's first years of life (he is going to law school abroad). I told him that is fine, and that he can get a job close by with his current business degree if he doesn't want to go to law school anymore. He says that this is not fair either as he wants to go to law school but doesn't have good enough grades to get into a school here, and it's not right of me to expect him to give up his dreams just because I want to keep the baby.  I think he's being a bit of a jerk seeing as I have NEVER told him that I would 100% get an abortion as well as for the fact that my parents are offering so much support so it doesn't have to ruin his life. He says that he shouldn't have to pay child support once he has a stable job for a child that he never wanted. However, even when I suggested adoption, he told me that he did not want some random person raising his child. I don't really understand where his head is at. It seems that he just does not want the baby to be born right now under any circumstances. I get that it isn't ideal, but things happen, and it seems selfish to me to end my child's chance of life when my parents are offering so much support. I'm hoping he will come around. AITA?\n",
      "So recently my mom has been talking about how my grandma is coming over and asked “if grandma doesn’t want to stay at your cousin’s house do you think you could let her stay in your room?” And my response was no. Don’t get me wrong I’m very glad my grandma is coming over to spend time with us but if she has the option to stay over at my cousin’s house then I don’t want to give away my room especially now that school is coming up. I’m heading into high school and I want to get good sleep my options are I sleep on the floor with blankets or I sleep on the couch. This is for a whole month. I have a puppy to take care of and I have all my needs in my room I can’t just give it away. I feel really bad and I might actually end up letting her keep my room but I need opinions AITA?\n",
      "Okay. I've had this friend for 11 years. I really liked her and thought of her more as a little sister than anything. After we graduated high school, we went to the same college and I felt like that made our relationship continue to blossom. Recently, she's been going through this moment of self-actualization and growth, really working with a therapist and getting to know how to be her best self. I love that for her and admire the strength it takes to do that.  Once I asked her to be my bridesmaid, however, things between us started to change. First, she had an issue with one of the groomsmen because she hooked up with him once 5-6 years ago and it made her uncomfortable. Then she claimed that she didn't like my fiance but admitted that she rarely spent time to get to know him over the past 7 years we've been dating. She stayed totally silent in the groupchat with the other bridesmaids where I update them, ask their opinions on things, and plan. Then she claimed that she thought he wasn't a good fit for me and that she thinks I deserve better. She had other reasons and explanations; she said that I made her feel uncomfortable years ago about interacting with him. We tried to work through it even though my feelings were hurt. For the most part, I took it as her caring about me and just trying to look out for me. I tried to give her opportunities to interact with him more like a big games night or offer a dinner get together. I gave her roles to feel as included in the wedding as I could.  Yesterday, we had to buy tickets quick for the bachelorette before the reduced Covid prices went up. Granted she was at work when this was happening, but she emailed the bridesmaid who planned to say she couldn't fly because of a medical issue. She never reached out to me or informed anyone of the medical issue when we started planning months ago. I reached out to her and after 2 hours, she responded and said that she'll still pay for her ticket and plan to drive down if she can't fly. I had decided then that this was the last straw for me even though it was the most miniscule thing. I was still hurt by her previous feelings and inclinations about my fiance and had been thinking about cutting her for a while. It came out that she still felt this way, and so I decided enough was enough. I extended that she could still come to the wedding as a guest, but she declined.  AITA? The amount of stress it caused me to know that she was in the bridal party while not agreeing with the wedding and basically faking it the whole time was causing me a lot of pain. Now, I replaced her with another friend who I haven't known as long but has been very excited about my whole engagement and instantly said yes when I asked her to step in. I guess I'm looking for validation that I did the right thing because I don't think my 11 year friendship will bounce back after this.\n",
      "I adopted my dog from the humane society a decade ago when I was still starting out in my field. We didn't have that much money. We lucked out. He was the only dog there and hadn't been put on the website yet. We were able to adopt our 4 month old puppy that same day. He's our best friend.   Rescue dogs werent as popular back then and it was still possible to adopt one without too much effort or time  Since then, campaign to sensitize people to puppy mills have worked incredibly. Most people have stopped «buying» dogs at pet stores or with sketchy breeder. Spaying and neutering campains are working really well.   But the downside is: there aren't enough puppies or dogs to adopt. Waitlists for an adult dog is a year and puppies, about two years.   I'm planning on adopting my second dog in the next couple of years. Since we are making a lot more money now, we have the means to pay more.   I was talking to a friend and explaining that I was reaching out to registered breeders to adopt a pure breed dog. I actually don't care about the pure breed part. I care about the puppy part. My kids are younger and I want to be able to train my dog from the start. I was also bitten twice as a child from dogs we adopted when they were older (3-4 years old).   My other argument is that if I was to register with the humane society or another rescue organization, we would be taking away a dog from a family that doesn't have 3000$ to pay for it. Most rescues charge 400$ which is not affordable but a reasonable price when you don't earn 6 figures.   She was arguing that registered breeders are still a plague and we should only adopt rescue dog.  I told her that since the governement has been shutting down more and more puppy mills and that people are spaying their dogs more frequently, there won't be enough rescue dog for people to adopt. Where ae the puppies going to come from?  She is refusing to talk to me and is bad mouhting me to friends. AITA?\n",
      "My step daughter just started working at a smoothie chain and is making $9.00 an hour. She just came home and complained that they only made $3.00 in tips tonight, and they were pretty busy. Apparently one of the registers wasn’t working correctly to this was also a factor in it.  I basically said oh honey, that sucks, but it’s not sit down service like a restaurant. I reminded her we don’t tip at McDonalds, Chipotle, Five Guys (burger chain) and places like that, and my husband interjected and said he tips at those places.   He doesn’t though, any time we go to a restaurant he hands me the receipt to figure out the tip anyway, and like I said, we don’t tip at fast food places. I had also explained why we tip there and not at her place of employment, and how she makes more per hour than wait staff.  Anyway, step daughter huffed her way upstairs, and now I’m the asshole for pointing out reality.  What do you think Reddit?\n",
      "Yeah, me again. My second story here, sorry if it's short. Anyways,  I was just playing bat and ball and the teacher left, so this boy grabbed the bat out of my hands WHILE I WAS STILL HOLDING IT.  So I clearly got upset, because I was going to roll the ball around and hit it with the bat. Eventually, he gave it back. All good right? What I thought.  He threw a ball at my and missed me barely, so I grabbed it and said I wouldn't it give it back because he did that to me. He runs up and grabs it out of my arms. It was a basketball by the way.  Then later, he threw it at my forehead and actually hit it.  AITA?\n",
      "My wife and I are in our 40s. She hasn't been feeling great lately (low energy, occasional nausea/headache). She's gone to the doctor and had a full workup. They didn't find anything and suggested it was stress. A few months later she's having some chest pain, nothing too severe. It lasts for a few days. Then she gets some numbness in her left arm, so she calls the doctor, the doctor says go to the Emergency Department. She says ok, so she goes to the ED, and messages me saying she's leaving for the ED. I'm at work at the time, my work is an hour away. I ask do you want me to come with you? She says no. She's in the ED for several hours, I'm messaging with her while she's there, asking how she's doing and what's happening. They run a bunch of tests, CT with contrast, ekgs, blood tests, everything comes back negative. They chalk it up to stress and send her home. I get home and she's angry at me for not going to see her in the ED. She says she shouldn't have to ask me, that I should have just gone.  AITA for not going to the ED?\n",
      "I(28m) and my sister (30f) both recently fell into financial/ relationship issues around the same time and decided to share a 2br 2bath apartment.  The master bedroom has its own bathroom suite and is my sister's room.  I have a  slightly smaller room and use the second bathroom. We split the rent 60/40 because she has the master bedroom.   The problem comes in because she has started having guests over and they've been using my bathroom. I've told her that I don't feel as though I should have to share my bathroom, toiletries or shower with her friends. I didn't invite them over so I should not have to clean up after them.  She doesn't see anything wrong with it because it's the closest bathroom to the livingroom and she doesn't want to have some of her friends going through her room to use the toilet.  I put a keyed lock on the door a few days ago before I went to work. When I came home, I found that she had taken it off. At this point I was pissed. I told her that she can either respect my space or I would move out. She called me petty and childish. AITA?  EDIT: I don't invite anyone over to the apartment.  Every guest is a friend of hers. In total,  I'd say there are 4 women who visit. Rarely is it ever all 4 at the same time.  At most, 1 or 2 at a time.  EDIT 2: It was suggested that I make another edit to clarify things.   I can afford to live on my own, she can not. At least not here.  We buy our own toiletries and paper products for our bathrooms. She likes different brands than I do.  We have had multiple conversations about this subject, at least 8.  Her friends have used my shower and body wash when they stayed over.  They sleep in her room when they stay.\n",
      "Backstory: My maternal grandmother had 2 sons and 2 daughters. My mother passed away in 2020, and the uncle who was still living with my grandmother passed away last summer. My aunt lives in a different city and has a husband and 3 adult sons. My remaining uncle lives in the U.S. with his wife. I live in the U.S. and my sister still lives in P.R.  After my mother's passing (when my uncle was still alive), my aunt took my grandmother to live with her because she has dementia or Alzheimers (no one has took her to a doctor to be properly diagnosed). About two months later, my aunt brought her back to stay with my uncle because she learned that taking care of her was difficult and apparently was causing issues with her social life (she's always at social events that scaled down during the pandemic and are scaling back up). After my uncle's passing, she has resorted to ask my sister to watch for her at days that my aunt has some social event or whatever.  My sister was talking to me last Saturday and sent me a picture from grandma's house, and she told me she wears a mask because my aunt is scaling up on her social outings and she's concerned (my sister and her partner are still taking the pandemic seriously and rarely go out). My sister told me that our aunt was attending a wedding on Saturday and she asked her to watch for grandma that day.   Later that night, I see status updates from my cousins, with pictures of his wedding and talking about how great it was. I was unaware that he was getting married, and when my sister called me the next day, I mentioned what I saw, and she sounded very surprised and asked me several times if I was sure that our cousin was getting married. My sister really didn't mind not being invited, but I could hear the disappointment in her voice that my aunt didn't tell her the truth, at least to send her regards.  I told my sister I could call them out, but she told me not to say anything, because my aunt will twist everything to make herself look better and make everyone else look bad, and my sister insists that my aunt is crazy based on some other incidents she had experienced.   According to my deceased relatives, my aunt has been acting really strange since my grandpa passed away and they weren't on speaking terms, but I know that they also had mental issues (which runs in my family. And maybe I'm speaking from an outsider's perspective, but my aunt has remained friendly to me.  Most likely I won't do anything out of love and respect for my sister, but I'd like to hear an unbiased opinion.\n",
      "My roommate and I are both 18 years old. We stay in dorms. When people knock on doors down the hall it can be heard in almost every dorm room.  On this day, I had my 8 am class. This class was in-person originally but my professor had to move it online. When I informed my roommate, she asked if I could go to one of the study lounges or libraries to take the class. I said yes, but if they weren't open, I would have to come back to the room. She seemed fine with this.   I went to the study lounge in my hall to take my class. I returned to my room about 10 minutes before the class ended because the lounge was cold. My roommate was getting ready for her class and everything seemed fine when she left. I started my laundry after my class and had just moved it to the dryer when the fire alarm went off.  I live on the top floor of my building and I have pretty bad knees (my roommate knows this). We all walked down the stairs. My knee was hurting but that was pretty normal. The problem was that it was about 40 degrees outside. My knee was already starting to swell up. While we were standing outside I texted my roommate to let her know about the fire alarm just in case she got out of class while we were evacuated.  By the time I was walking back up the stairs, I could tell there would be a problem. My entire leg was starting to swell and my laundry was finally dry so I would have to get my bag from my room and go back downstairs to get my clothes. I decided to wait about 30 minutes and go back down using the elevators. At this point, I could barely walk. My roommate came back from class and I told her that I didn't know if I would be able to go to class because of my leg.  I ended up going and when I got back my roommate was gone. We were supposed to have a floor meeting so I texted to ask if she would be there. She said she wouldn't because she had gone to the mall. When I got back from the meeting, I got in bed with an icepack and called my mom to tell her about my leg.  My roommate came back from the mall and knocked on our door (I didn't know it was her at the time). I was still on the phone with my mom, in bed, with my knee being iced. I thought someone was knocking on another door. She let herself in with her key. She had 3 or 4 bags so her hands were a bit full. She asked (kinda yelled) why I didn't open the door and I told her that I was on the phone with my mom and I didn't know it was her.   She came back later that night when I was starting to go to sleep and said she had to talk to me. She told me she was upset that I didn't open the door for her. I told her what I had said before. She dismissed me and told me she was also upset that I didn't text to check on her whenever she went out to make sure she was ok. I told her that I didn't think she needed me to do that because she's an adult but I would start to do it if it would make her feel safer. She said not to bother because it wouldn't be genuine.  AITA?\n",
      "So at the moment I'm writing a story I worked for a very long time. I thought about the story and the plot a lot, wrote it down on paper, made changes etc. and at the moment I re-write it on computer. And not only that I had the wish to write this story (or book if everything would work out well) for a very long time but I also write it in english (not my main language) so it helps me a lot. I do some practice and something I like in the same time. Well, the thing is that many times when I write at it and I enter in a very serious state, being concentrated at what I do, it happenes to be interrupted by my family - mostly mother. That is why sometimes I ask them from before to give me 2 - 3 hours alone so I can write, but she is saying that it's not such a big deal. After more time when she saw I'm serious about this she started making jokes or being ironies. Things like \"I'm sorry to disturb you from your veeery important things you were doing *snicker*\" or when I say that I was writing \"I'm sorry you were writing. Ups, I meant to say sorry for interrupting you from writing\" etc. Many times she does it in front of others and of course, they all start laughing or hold back laughter. Now, she's saing that it's inportant in life to do what you want as well and that she'll support me, but what she asks in return is to ask for her help when I need and to keep her posted with what I'm doing. The thing is...she is saying that she supports me, but I can't see the support and many times her remarks made me to almost drop it (I'm sensitive with what the ones I love say about me or my work). I'll soon move to my own appartment and I know that because of being far from her, she'll want even more details about what I'm doing and writing. I know she doesn't realize how much it hurts what she's doing, I have the same problem on some directions after all, but even if I explained everything to her and asked her to stop she didn't and told me how much I overreact. So AITA if when she or asks about what I do/write I tell her that it's my problem?\n",
      "Little context, My(26M) brother(27) got married to his long distance girlfriend (26) for 7-8 years a year. He's a chef, used to work in a cruise line in the US and she's a nurse. Unfortunately due to COVID all his plans to migrate to some other country and have a job in the mainland got shattered. One thing to note is that, these jobs are paid pennies in India compared to the effort they put in. Anyways, during the break he had, he started out a take away service during COVID and it was going well (I've helped him with this, both financially and by other means).   Last year, her family started plans to get her married and he had to make a move. I was of the idea that have a word with her family and get married after a year or so, when he'll be financially stable. On the contrary, this didn't happen. Along with that he was pestered by her to move this as an arranged marriage thing (this is common in India). Her family still doesn't know that they're in a relationship for years. I was really pissed off after hearing this, my parents didn't say anything against this as they didn't want to hurt their son. Finally I kept silent and let them do what they feel, I didn't make any fuss about it.  They got married 1-2 months after this, and she resigned at around that time period( I still don't know why). They got married and things were okay initially, but after few months she started behaving strange, started making issues at home, between them. Accusing my mother of silly matters etc. After few weeks, they told us she's pregnant. I was really worried about them, both of them were unemployed at that time and to bring a kid in that circumstances made me worry. I couldn't even think of placing myself there. I didn't ask them about what's their choice and all, it's completely their choice, I don't have a say in that.  Later when I came home to visit them, me and my brother had a couple of drinks, and I started asking what's his plan? What were you thinking etc. To the context I'd like to add that, my brother was in fact losing money on stock markets, that too in options trading, when I asked him do you know what options are? He said he doesn't know. I was very much worried and rubbed the fact right into his face that he isn't going the right track.  I live in another city.  AITA?  Edit: some grammar corrections.\n",
      "My wife is a veterinarian and started at a new practice a couple months ago. This practice is much larger with a more formal structure than the one she left (left a one owner practice and went to a mid sized corporate group). Today was her day off, except she had to attend a doctor's meeting in the late afternoon. These meetings can take up to two hours.  She kept floating the idea of taking our oldest to the meeting, which I kept saying was unnecessary as I stay home with our other two kids and regularly get him after school on days she's working. She eventually told him he might be able to come with her, which in his mind means he gets to go with Mommy to work. At this point I flatly told her no, he's not going. This upset him, as he doesn't understand that neither an hour plus meeting of professionals nor an active vet center is somewhere a 5 year old should be.  I know she wants to spend more time with the kids, our son especially, but bringing him to a doctor's meeting where she needs to be actively participating isn't the way to do it.  TL/DR: wife wanted to take our 5 year old to a doctor's meeting, I said no. AITA?\n",
      "Context:  He and I were met online over a game and became close friends and developed feelings.  We met twice, had sex a couple times during one of those trips, and I broke things off after around 7 months.  I'm not interested at all anymore. He has told me has feelings but he is able to accept being friends. We used to talk every day but that has slowly tapered off as I've moved on.  Not sure if that is relevant to the story but it might help.  I've been sick for over a month with a bad cough.  He has asked me once or twice before if I thought about going and seeing a doctor to have it checked out.  I didn't sleep well last night and was in the middle of my work day when the exchange below occurred:  --------------------------------------------  [5:49 AM] Him: Morning, hope you had a good night.  [11:31 AM] Me: Good morning!  [11:32 AM] Me: I did not sleep well, I kept coughing  [3:55 PM] Him: You should go pick up a cough suppressant on the way home, it'll solve that problem.  [3:55 PM] Me: Yeah, I have a plan.  [3:56 PM] Him: Does it involve seeing the doctor or just chancing it for another month?  [3:56 PM] Me: Alright, have a good day.  [3:56 PM] Him: ?  [3:57 PM] Me: Your snarky shit  [3:57 PM] Him: Not at all?  [3:57 PM] Him: I didn't think that would offensive  [3:57 PM] Him: my bad  [3:57 PM] Him: I wasn't throwing shots  [3:57 PM] Him: I told you I've had a cough for over a month  [3:57 PM] Me: LOOOL  [3:57 PM] Me: Whatever  [3:57 PM] Me: Im not stupid.  [3:58 PM] Me: I dont know what your deal is, or where this is coming from.  [3:58 PM] Me: But it's not helpful, you sound like you're just trying to be a shit for ???? reasons.  [3:59 PM] Him: Well I'm genuinely sorry, that wasn't my intention.  I was trying to be helpful by saying take a cough suppressant so you could sleep.  Honestly wasn't talking shit or throwing shots.  I have no reason or motive, like why would I just come out of nowhere to do that?  Literally, there is no background there at all.  [3:59 PM] Me: You are  [3:59 PM] Me: literally  [4:00 PM] Me: making a jab  [4:00 PM] Him: Am I giving you a hard time for not going to the doctor?  [4:00 PM] Him: yea  [4:00 PM] Me: for me  [4:00 PM] Me: trying  [4:00 PM] Me: to  [4:00 PM] Him: but not talking sh it  [4:00 PM] Him: or being mean  [4:00 PM] Me: wait it out  [4:00 PM] Me: you have  [4:00 PM] Me: made  [4:00 PM] Me: the same  [4:00 PM] Me: comment  [4:00 PM] Me: before  [4:00 PM] Me: how  [4:00 PM] Me: are you not  [4:00 PM] Me: getting it  [4:00 PM] Him: because you're telling me I tried to do something I didnt, but my bad  [4:00 PM] Him: I get it.

[4:02 PM] Me: What is the difference between \" giving you a hard time for not going to the doctor\" and \"but not talking sh it\", because they are synonymous.  [4:03 PM] Me: Giving a hard time = talking shit.  [4:03 PM] Me: ???????????  [4:03 PM] Me: Him Today at 1:00 PM  Am I giving you a hard time for not going to the doctor?  yea  &#x200B;  HimToday at 1:00 PM  but not talking sh it  [4:03 PM] Me: LOL  [4:06 PM] Him: Ok, I'm going to just back up.  I'm not taking shots at you.  I'm not trying to be mean to you.  I have no motivation nor reason to do that. I was making a light hearted comment about not seeing the doctor, yes, but was it ill intention or meant to upset or degrade you?  Not at all.  &#x200B;  That isn't talking shit, that is poking fun/teasing like you and I do all the time.  It isn't malicious, I'm not trying to make you mad, or be mean.  I have said it before and in that same breath I said \"I've had a cough for over a month before and didn't see the doctor\".  I' have no reason to talk shit or start something over your cough.  And now you're trolling me with emotes??  Wtf?? I said my bad, it wasn't my intent to sit there and rile you up and talk shit.  How did that comment boil into this?  I'm so god damn confused.  Fuck, my bad, I was trying to shoot the shit and tease you a bit but god damn not attack, insult, and fight you over seeing the doctor of all things.  --------------------------------------------  There is more but wont post it unless an update is requested.  You can imagine the rest - basically I just repeated myself and he couldn't understand or accept that he was giving me shit and coming at me.  &#x200B;  Am I the asshole?\n",
      "My ex texted me yesterday saying she needed to talk to me about something about our son. I wasn't able to reach her yesterday, so I called today at Disney World while I was sitting alone while my GF and her friend and her friend's husband were in line. It was a 7 minute call.  She told me some very important news. After the phone call my GF and our friends sit down. I mention I just found out my ex wife and son are moving nearby, like matter of factly. My GF complains that somehow my ex always ruins her vacations and why couldn't I just call her later. I say because I might never know what it is she needed to tell me then. She calls my ex a bitch in front of our friends. I try to motion to her to just cool it, like that is not classy. Then she starts crying, but stops after a second. We get up and start walking and we're bickering as the other couple walks a bit ahead. She says I always \"put my ex before her\". I say that's not true, I just wanted to know my son's whereabouts. She just dismisses me. I tell her I have responsibilities. She repeats that I should have called her later. That's when I walked away. She still refuses to apologize and blames me for everything, so I am refusing to meet them again. I'm about to leave the park. Am I the asshole? PS: GF does not have kids.  EDIT: she said i should have called her later, not that i shouldn't have called her.\n",
      "So there's a en more bench press machines or incline/decline benches) and it was a super busy day, so this guy was standing off like ten feet away, I didn't even notice he was there for the benches because of how far away he was.  I overheard him telling someone that there was a line for the benches and he was waiting next.  In the meantime all the people benching were just sitting there taking a breather, so I asked one if they were saving the bench for anyone or if I could workout in between their sets.  I nodded over to the guy who was supposedly in line and the guy told me that he had no idea there was \"a line\" and that I could jump in since he only had a few more to do anyways.  The guy ended up only doing one more set after I set down and then I was on my own, I then overheard the same guy who was in line talking shit about how \"there's a line but some people just don't care I guess\" to someone else.  Am I the asshole for working into someone's sets instead of waiting for this guy's \"line\"?\n",
      "Hello,  Throwaway account so my friends don't find out about my \"secret.\"  I(M, would prefer to not disclose my age) am a \"closeted homosexual\". I live in an apartment complex, and am roommates with my best friend Nicky (M, forgot his age but somewhere in his twenties). I am very picky and a perfectionist about cleanness, while he is messy, for example, leaving his clothes everywhere. I pay for most of the rent, due to my high-paying job as an investment banker.  He has suspicions about my sexuality, and has assured me that if I  were , then he would accept me for who I am. He tells me this all the time, despite me telling him constantly that I am not gay. I have tolerated him so far, but at our neighbor's wedding, he announced, much to my chagrin, that he thought that I was a \"closeted homosexual.\" This led to an extremely heated conversation, and I was able to temporarily cover up the fact that I am indeed gay. Upon getting home, I immediately kicked him out. He is now homeless; after trying to stay in our neighbors' apartment, he was kicked out due to his messiness. He has apologized sincerely, but I am not sure that I can forgive him for sharing his suspicions about me.  As to why I feel as if I cannot come out to my friends, I come across as very uptight and conservative, and it just feels weird for me to like another guy.  I forgot to mention, I have somewhat of a \"crush\" on him.   So, AITA for kicking out my roommate?\n",
      "I took my kids and my nieces out for dessert recently. I let them order what they wanted and my niece, Melissa, ordered a huge sundae that could’ve fed all of them and that I knew she would never finish. I told her if she was going to get it that she would have to share with my daughter who also wanted ice cream. She said she would after some sulking but when the sundae arrived, she kept trying to stop my daughter from eating any even though she barely got through half of it, so I had to tell her off.  When we got home Melissa started complaining to her mother and my mother-in-law that I was mean to her and didn't let her eat her ice cream. Her mother thinks I should’ve bought all of the kids separate desserts even though that would’ve been a huge waste since my daughter is only 3 and barely ate any of the sundae anyway. Melissa also mentioned how nobody else had to share so it wasn't fair but nobody else ordered a dessert that big.  This has turned into a huge thing because I refused to apologise for not buying Melissa her own dessert and my brother-in-law and husband have been dragged into it too.   AITA?\n",
      "Growing up I (25M) didn’t know who my dad (56M) was. I was told my mom didn’t tell my dad about the pregnancy. I would always ask about who my dad was, and I would ask so many times. When I was 12, my mother found my dad’s cousin on FB and reached out to him about me to get into contact with my dad. The next thing I know I get to know my dad and his side of the family. Throughout my teens, i got to know my aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins… and I would visit them out in CA anytime i was off from school.  My dad lives overseas for work and comes back to the US (CA) to visit his family. I would usually meet up with him in CA to spend some time with him. With the extent of our relationship, I will send him a message on WhatsApp but that’s about it since the convo doesn’t go anywhere. He usually never calls me for birthdays either and just sends money as a gift. He’s never visited me as it was always me going to him in CA.   A year ago, I was visiting my dad and his side of the family. This was the first time seeing my 7-year-old half-sister and 1 year old half-brother. One day I was in my guest room just chatting with my half-sister and she asked what my relation was to the family. I told her I’m her brother, but she didn’t know that and thought I was joking. She asked him about it and he confirmed it. A while after, my stepmother tells me she and my dad just wanted my little sister to meet me before telling her she had an older half-brother… even though i had been with them for at least 2 days at that point.   Here’s a twist. So, I recently visited my mom’s side of the family. I went to visit my mom’s best friend, who is an aunt or second mom to me since she practically helped my mom raise me until she moved out of the country when I was 7. One day we’re talking, and the topic of my dad comes up. Especially my mom’s pregnancy with me. Apparently, her and my mom called my dad (mom had terrible English at the time) and DID tell him about the pregnancy but he didn’t want to do anything with me. I was incredibly confused and told her that my mom didn’t tell him until years later, she corrected me and told me the truth. My aunt didn’t know my mom was hiding it from me so i doubt there was any malicious intent in telling me that.   Given recent happenings and how my relationship with him has been throughout my life, i feel guilty in some ways for putting expectations on him that I probably shouldn’t of. But maybe it was also my paternal grandparents for putting pressure on him to keep a relationship with me and pay for child support + college. I’m not sure how to view the relationship since i have my own biases and a stranger’s opinion could help. Maybe he was trying but didn’t know how but I don’t know since I never really saw much of an effort.\n",
      "On mobile, therefore I’m sorry for the formatting.  I (F29) have got 3 sisters. When younger ones stopped believing in Santa, we switched to Secret Santa. Especially, after my SO started celebrating Christmas with us - we figured it's better to get one large, thoughtful gift than a lot of small ones. This year, around November, my younger sister asked in a family chat if we are doing Secret Santa again this year. Everyone was on board, except my older sister, F. (F30). She and my BIL have 3 children and claimed that there is to much cost involved in buying presents for the kids and they wouldn't be able to afford additional presents. Seems fair, same thing happened twice already. But previously we chipped in to buy them something, so they wouldn't feel left out. Christmas Eve comes, gifts \"magically\" appear under the christmas tree, everyone is happy. It turns out I got two gifts - one from my Secret Santa and one from F.'s family - a quite expensive wollen hat, because I don't wear hats in winter and she was worried I would get sick. Suddenly, F. started crying, excused herself and left the room. She returned few minutes later and behaved like nothing happened. I strongly believe she was devastated she didn't get anything. I feel like a complete AH, but they were asked if they want to participate and refused.  F. struggles with many insecuritis and mental health problems and didn't want to stir the pot with talking with her about it. You know, maybe that wasn't the issue and I will draw her attention to it and it will become an issue? My husband says it's her own fault, but still... AITA?\n",
      "so recently the brawlhalla mobile closed beta was released. I luckily managed to be chosen as a beta tester to help. However, I found out that my device was not compatible for the game (I gave feedback about lowering bit rate required).  My friends are avid fans of the game. For reasons, the only way I could play brawlhalla would be on a mobile device. My friends often play with each other on other platforms. However, seeing as you can only install the game using the email signed up with, they are trying to convince me to give them my email account so they can play instead of me. AITA for not doing so?\n",
      "Hi everyone,  Let me give you some background information first: I live at 140km (european kilometers so that means a large distance to me) from my parents and the only way for me to get there is by train + bus/tram (around 2hs). I'm the second of four sisters and only the two younger ones still live with my parents (I moved out about 3 years ago). The youngest sister has been dealing with a mental health problem for the past few years but is finally getting better now.  The situation is the following: I went to international school so all my friends are from abroad and always go back to their respective countries for the holidays, leaving me by myself and this year is no different. Because of this at my 24 years of age I've never gone out for NYE and it's sort of a sore spot because my family and I, though we are very close, have not been the most functional the last few years.   Every year I spend the holidays with them, get depressed that I have to start a new year alone again and promise next year will be different but it never is. This makes me a quite bitter and ngl drunken person to be that night usually. So this year I decided to stop this cycle and spend it by myself at home where I have the freedom to do whatever I want (e.g. drink and smoke until I pass out either on top of my vibrator or in front of an episode of sex and the city) instead of having to go to my parents' and spend it with them and my youngest sister pretending to not be miserable, since I already did that for Christmas (and stayed at their place for a week) and neither my older sister (who doesnt live in this country) nor the third sister (who is going on a trip with her boyfriend) are spending their NYE with them.  Now, I know maybe not being happy to spend the holidays makes me an asshole but I cant change that at this point. I asked my parents whether they'd be ok with me not coming over and they said I should do whatever I want, but the third sister (the one going on the trip) is judging me for breaking their hearts for staying home.  Taking into account trains stop working here after 6pm because of the holidays (so coming over just for dinner and then leaving is out of the question) and I'm busy the next day, am I an asshole for not spending New Year's Eve with them?  Thank you and sorry for the long read.  EDIT: Thanks to everyone that replied! I feel better standing up for myself now and my sister apologized and told me to do my own thing, which I will do comfortably at home.\n",
      "A little bit of backstory, MIL (F50s)and I (F20) work at the same daycare.  She’s been there a lot longer than I have.  This past Friday I was called into our directors office to have a chat with her.  The gist of it was that my MIL had been causing my son (M2) to have meltdowns because she would go down there during the day and disrupt his schedule, and when she left the caretakers weren’t able to console him.  The reason he becomes inconsolable is because he thinks he’s going to get to come home every time one of us appears in the classroom.  My director asked if it was okay if she talked to my MIL about this and asked if I wanted her to be able to go in there.  I said no, that my sons mental and physical well-being is more important to me than her seeing her grandson when she’s supposed to be working.  I thought they were only going to have a little chat with her and ask her to stay out of the room.  Instead, they gave her a letter of reprimand, which is a big deal and stays on your record.  Instead of coming to me and asking me about it, MIL decided to blow up my fiancées (M20) phone while he was at work.  She harassed him for about 3-4 hours.  Then his dad, my FIL (M50s) texted him saying to enjoy his new family and that they want all their stuff back, which we have maybe 2 things of theirs that we had been planning on returning already.  Now no one is speaking to each other.  I feel bad that my fiancée is in the middle of all of this, and the whole situation is so messed up.  AITA for getting my mother in law in trouble at work?  Edit: Just wanted to clarify.  This wasn’t MIL’s first time hearing this same complaint.  I had asked her before to stop going in his room.  My son is autistic, so he has some behavioral problems we’ve been working on.  She knew that they talked to me because apparently on the letter of reprimand, it stated which child she had to stay away from.  I don’t know this for sure, this is just what I heard from her and I’m going to request a copy today since if my child’s name is on it, I should be able to have a copy.  Edit 2: Y’all I can’t just move daycares.  Since I work at this one, I am getting childcare for free and there’s no daycare that’s gonna beat that.  Also I’ve been promised by many members of upper management, including the director, that if anything else happens with her at work then their doors are always open.  I’m fortunate enough to have enough people on my side that see her behavior too.\n",
      "Recently my husband told me he was going to a work meeting at around 11am. He returned home and I asked him how it went, he told me and we proceeded with our day. I fell asleep at around 10:30pm,he then came to bed about 11pm. He woke me and asked me to turn on the light, I said what for? As I was in a real sleepy state. He said he needed me to look at something. I immediately put the light on thinking he had some injury or a funny mole or something! Anyway, he revealed a tattoo which I genuinely thought was drawn on, he has never had a tattoo in his life. My eyes were barely focussing as I'd been asleep. Turns out he didn't go to a work meeting and he instead went to get a tattoo.  It was a design incorporating our two daughters initials, it's nice, I like it but for a few days I felt hurt that he didn't tell me, and if it was a surprise why on earth would he keep it from me the entire day, eat dinner together and watch tv together only to reveal it when I'm half asleep at 11pm at night?  Anyway I'm over it. Now he has started to design something for the other arm. I've never really seen him as a tattoo guy but I'm happy he's doing something he wants to do. He's a mega film guy, loves movies so wanted to get a clapper board which I thought was cool. He was going to get our wedding date on it which I thought was a nice touch. However, now it's turned into TV and music on top of movies and one of his designed I didn't think looked great, so I just made a comment that I wasn't keen on it.   All hell has broken loose, he's said I never support him in things he wants to do (I'm really hurt by this as I love him, in my mind I've got nothing but support for him) and he also said because I don't like it it makes him want to do it more...am I being unreasonable to think that as his wife my opinion matters? If I wanted to cut my hair off or get a nose piercing I would 100% be looking for his opinion.   If you're still reading, thanks.  AITA?\n",
      "I'll try to keep this simple, English is not my primary language   Small background : I'm a teacher, and in my country (as in any other country apparently), there's a shortage of teachers.  Back in February, I was overwhelmed by a lot of things, and one of those things was my principal and the number of children I had to manage (32, on my own, 3d and 4th grade).  Without any support from my principle (some of my colleagues helped, but it wasn't enough) I ended up completely burnt out, and my doctor stopped me. I spent 2 months in my bed doing nothing but sleep, I was a total wreck. The mere thought of school was enough to send me spiraling again and again.  Today, I feel better, but as the end of the school year is near, I'm starting to feel anxious again. In those 6 months I spent home, I had some time to think, and I know I don't want to go back, I still have panick attacks just thinking about it.  Where I think I could be the asshole, is that I know we don't have enough teachers. I teach in a small school, with a small team, and I teach in a foreign language, which means it's even more difficult to replace me. I feel like abandoning them, abandoning the children and the school. I know there's another teacher leaving at the end of the year, so the school is going to have to replace 2 people, instead of one if I decide to stay.  But if I go back, it's certainly going to damage my mental health. I don't want anything to do with my principal, ever again.  Even knowing that, I can't help to feel like an as*hole for my decision, especially since my principal doesn't want me to tell the team before the last day of school.  So, WIBTA if I didn't go back to work next year ?\n",
      "i respect my pops. i look up to him and know he has done much for me. (helped me buy a car, gave me a place to live after i was 18, got me a career oppotunity job, granted me the gift of life) he has admitted to me that he neglected me during my upbringing and has apologized for it. he now lives about 20 miles from me. im not sure if its because im the only single adult child, but hes always asking me for favors. like babysitting my little brother and sister. helping out with work on the weekends. staying after work to help him with his own work. i say yes because i feel obligated and he literally guilts me into saying yes sometimes. but imo i have my own life to live now. im trying to live my own life and i dont want the stress of his problems. ie) kids, house work, his job. i want to spend my time doing what i like. working out. painting. drawing. writing. hanging out with someone whom im starting a relationshion with [23F] but he’s constantly bombarding me with “favors” he needs. its gotten to the point where now im annoyed and upset and i dont want to talk to him but i dont want our relationship to suffer. i feel like im being petty and disrespectful but i also feel like hes not respecting my time. what do?\n",
      "is going to be a long post sorry in advance. Back in March, my s/o and I got laid off from our jobs at a moving company because of corona virus. Not long after that, a distant relative messaged me on Facebook. She knew that I worked for a moving company and had some questions about how much they charge on average for moves that were similar in size to her situation. She wanted pack, load, deliver. She had roughly 10,000 lbs worth of stuff, which would fill up a 26' moving truck. She told me that she had estimates from two different moving companies and they both quoted her roughly 3,000. I told her that was average and that the reason they are charging so much is because of all the packing labor and the weight of her shipment, plus the distance. She said that she had didn't want to spend more than 2,300 for her budget. So I told her that my s/o and I would do it for 1,000 for our labor. That includes packing up all her stuff into boxes, loading truck, driving it todestination, and unloading truck and putting together furniture.   Told that she would have to pay for her truck rental and gas out of her own pocket. Calculated the rental and gas fees, came out to roughly 800 for everything. She didn't like that idea which was fine. Asked me how much would we charge her if she just to load a trailer. Told her 400 and  she agreed. A few days before her moving date, I message her just to confirm that we are still on for the move. She says that her husband hasn't gotten whatever money he was counting on and that they don't even have a house yet??? I said okay it's no problem, just message me later if she was prepared and still wanted my services. I started getting really uneasy feelings about the whole situation.   Another story that kinda ties into this one. My s/o and I had moved another much closer relative that I knew very well. Their move was much, much larger than this other woman's move. They were older and at the time they were having health issues. So we felt bad and went to their house, packed up all their stuff, and loaded everything into a 40' livestock trailer for them. They had so much stuff that we PACKED that trailer 3 times before the house was empty. Now I wasn't expecting any money from them, nor had I asked for it. They told me after the move was done that they wanted to give me $500 to split with my s/o. Turns out that never happened.  Point being, I have been ripped off by people I have helped move before. So I am wary.... Today the relative who wants help sends me a Facebook message. It reads \"Ok so my husband started getting his payments but he hasn’t gotten all the back pay they owe him. We have enough for our house and the move right now but we won’t have 400 for you guys to help unless he gets another payment.\" Huge res flag feels like she's trying to make me feel sorry, do the job with promise of payment and then never pay.  AITA for not wanting to do the job now?\n",
      "My friends and I are having a conversation about how I handled a situation at the club last weekend.  On Friday night we went out to the clubs and when we where in line a girl tapped my shoulder and told me I was cute I said thanks and then ignored her because I was in conversation with my friends. We get into the bar and see that the debit machines broke (classic now you need to pay the 3$ atm fee) I go to the atm across the bar because it was empty.  While getting my cash the same girl threw her body in front of the machine and tried hugging me I brushed her off and told her I wasn’t interested.   Fast forward about 30 minutes I ran into a girl who is in one of my classes but haven’t really talked to that much so I offer to buy her a drink.  At the bar ready to order the crazy girl comes back and asks if I’ll buy her one. Now I’m kinda getting annoyed with her and tell her to leave me alone as I’m trying to talk with the other girl.   Another 10 minutes goes by me and the girl from my class are dancing together and at this point I’m not even thinking of the crazy girl anymore until she comes up to me from behind and starts hugging me. Now I’m really pissed and without even thinking I turn around and tell her “I’m not even remotely attracted to you so fuck off”   After that she never came back to me and I enjoyed the rest of my night.   TLDR: girl kept on trying to hit on me/hug me at the bar so I told her I’m not remotely attracted to her.  AITA?\n",
      "I sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender \"new skin\". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline.   In some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.  But in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as \"the girl with the scar\" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.  This week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.  I'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist.   It also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.  So I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.  I wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about...   His father said to me, \"Can you cover that injury?\"   I said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will.   He started snapping at me saying \"there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.\"  I said \"this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.\"  He started to backtrack saying \"just until it's healed\" and I said \"it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude.   He actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.  AITA for not covering my healing scar, and for being confrontational about it?\n",
      "One of my (23F) friends (21F) has almost no boundaries. She shares very personal information, including her insecurities, whether she hates someone or has a major crush on someone, and almost every thought and feeling. She’s also very loud and loves filling every silence.   I see her as someone who needs better friends in life because she tries very (if not too) hard to make friends. She seems pretty naive and innocent and really just seems like a lot goes over the top of her head.   Recently on a night out, another girl in the group was talking shit about a very popular boy. He’s actually a great person, he just sleeps around a lot. He’s a very good friend to me and this friend of mine, but this other girl doesn’t like him. She was saying all kinds of nasty things about him and his new girlfriend, most likely out of jealousy. Instead of defending him, my friend very loudly and laughingly mocked his new girlfriend and him. She was basically just saying she didn’t like his new girlfriend from first impressions and then listed the very few bad things about him. Remember he is a great person and friend, but yeah he does have a bad quality or two.   My biggest problem was that she was only talking about the worst in a great person and talking shit about his girlfriend from meeting her ONCE, to befriend this other girl. It just comes across like she has no loyalty by throwing him and his girlfriend under the bus, even though I’m fairly sure she didn’t mean it that way.   WIBTA for telling her exactly how it is?\n",
      "My husband was going sailing with his brother and a few others. He was supposed to take our son, who is 3, with him but he had to take a call when they were supposed to leave. My brother-in-law offered to take our son but I said no as I was worried he would get scared if his dad wasn’t there as this would be his first time sailing.  My brother-in-law tried to convince me to let him take my son because my husband was planning to join them later anyway but I told him if my husband went, our son would go with him. He was offended and asked me if I didn’t trust him. I told him I did but he was still offended.  I explained what happened once my husband got off the phone and even he asked me if I didn’t trust his brother and was upset I hadn’t let our son go with him.  AITA?\n",
      "Okay, so, I’m currently 18/M and the friend in question is 20/F. We had met at a comic-con in 2018 and immediately hit it off (due to our matching Gorillaz cosplays).  We spoke nearly everyday for hours on end, and she even let me talk to some of her friends as well (one of which i am very good friends with to this day). She had her own Discord server that I’d joined, and we had a voice call in there one night, where we’d all bonded quite a lot. We made a private group chat just to voice call, and it was full of bullshittery and banter. We even created our own YouTube channel, because we thought we were hilarious (and we were!)  Back to the one friend though. After maybe 3 months of this little YouTube career (and only 1 video) she started to become more distant. I asked if anything was wrong with her, and she said no. I told her that she seemed a little bit more distant nowadays, which she apologised for.  I found out she found a new boyfriend after he was live-streaming on insta. I thought ‘Ok cool’. He was now also in the Discord server, and he was also a cool guy. Really liked him, we talked about baseball.  The issue with their relationship was that it was LDR (She lived in Britain and he was in America).   She drifted more and more from our friendship, evading my texts on purpose. It kinda hurt, I won’t lie. I knew she was okay and stuff because she wouldn’t stop posting on her story about this new guy friend she had. I thought maybe she didn’t care about our friendship anymore (and to back this up, the aforementioned other friends said they’d noticed that she’d started to talk less to them)  I had my thoughts, maybe her boyfriend had manipulated her into focussing more on him than us. But that’s gotta be ludicrous!  If we were friends, she’d drop in to say hi at least one or twice a week just to say hello or whatever, but I didn’t really get anything off her, except for one worded answers that showed she couldn’t give a shit.  And then, she got engaged to this boyfriend that she’d met off the internet after only 7 months. And what really sucks about this is that I found out through a mutual friend, a month after it had happened. This was the kicker for me. If she didn’t even think to tell me this exciting news, then is she really a friend? At this point, I’d had enough. I let her know how unhappy I was that she didn’t let me know about her engagement, amongst other things, and that she called herself a friend but never dropped in. She left all that on read, so I decided I was just gonna cut ties with her and let go. I blocked her on everything I had her on, because I didn’t wanna see her boyfriend and only her boyfriend on her stories. It’s as if she’s forgotten about all her friends (one mutual said he’d received the same treatment, and had given up trying ages ago)  So, a friend who doesn’t act like a friend, but more like they’d want nothing to do with me. It hurts man.   AITA for cutting ties with her over this?  EDIT: May I quickly clarify that she “forgot” to tell me a lot more than just the engagement, I just didn’t mention examples because it’s kinda personal stuff and you don’t wanna hear about it\n",
      "Throwaway cause Ray follows me on my main account.  I (20 M) have been friends with Ray (20 M) since we were in primary school. Our families were close growing up so naturally that only made us closer. We are like brothers. We both go to the same college and room together as well. Well, ever since we started going to college, a girl who I will call Marie (20 F) took a big interest in him. They started dating last year after being FWB for a little while.  I didn't have a problem with Marie until she started showing weird behaviors like getting passive-aggressive and possessive when our female friends came over. I digress, onto the problem. Four months ago, I started dating my girlfriend Lily (19 F). Anytime Lily comes around our dorm and Marie is there (from what I see) Marie has insecurity issues that get placed onto Lily. It seems like her goal is to make Lily uncomfortable. It's not like Lily bothers anyone. She's usually silently studying. Last night Lily came over to help me because I have been struggling in my chemistry course and who better to help me than a biochemistry major? When she arrived, she was wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top, nothing insane. When Marie saw her, she made a \"joke\" that her outfit couldn't scream more for attention. I could see this upset lily because she frowned and mumbled something like, \"this is a normal outfit.\"  I think this, with the past incidents we've had, sent me over the edge and I snapped at Marie telling her that she needs to grow up and work on her insecurities if a tank top and shorts bother her so intensely. Her face turned red, and she went back into Ray's room.  A couple of minutes later I got a text from Ray saying what I did wasn't cool and I should've spoken to her privately instead of embarrassing her. I just ignored it because I had to study anyway but now I'm wondering AITA? Is there something I could have gone different?\n",
      "I'm really curious as I've never been on Tinder. I am not looking for a relationship at all but I do wish to get a nice confidence boost from time to time. I was thinking I could do this by making a profile on Tinder and maybe flirting with any possible matches without it going any further.   So WIBTA if I did this? I'm a guy if that helps.\n",
      "I am now in extremely shitty situation. My daughter(Jane) cut all contact with me after my wife made some racist comments about her bf. I agree what she did is disgusting but Jane told me choose either between her or wife. How the hell I am supposed to do that. TBH my wife comes from racist family I called her out many times but I think racism is deeply rooted into her now it is impossible to do anything about it. This happened five years ago, Jane and her bf getting married soon. She called me yesterday and asked for some money as she is laid off. Actually she told me to honour promise I made to all my daughters(I helped them financially when they get married). I refused. I told her I made promise to my daughter and as she denounced me as her father I am no longer going to help her out. AITA ?  Edit: There is no way I was going to divorce my wife, we are together since last 25 years. As I said I called her out many times during past. She is not vocal like she was before but she still makes comments here and there which I think as a progress because 30 years ago when I met her, whole family were extremely racist and bigoted. That time I was blind by love so I overlook that but other than that we have no issues in our marriage. I am proud that my children's are not racist. No, I didnt contact her in last 5 years neither she did. I was extremely upset by ultimatum and she knew her mother's behaviour and as I said I made promise to my children's butt dont think I am her dad, she even called me Mr. Xyz not dad. Why I should help her if she is not interested in any relationship and thinks me as a moneybag only ?  Edit2: To answering another question. No I never made any attempt to amend our relationship. I can understand if she dont want her mother around her family. But what I did, even I am stranger to my own grandchildren's, I honestly have no idea what she told them. Now she celebrates father's day mother's day with her bf's family congratulate them on social media make comments like how happy she is to finally get real family who love her. It breaks my heart, if she clearly think I am not her father why come to me for financial help ?  Edit3: Well many racist changes because they wanted to, my wife after that incident never made any racist comment(at least in front of me) and also persuading me to help her out.  Edit4: She is laid off, and I guess he is still working. She told me that she will split money like 30% for small wedding ceremony and other 70% savings/ for uncertain future/paying bills etc.  Update: https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gx9c11/update_aita_for_not_helping_my_daughter/\n",
      "Last year I was in university, so couldn’t really afford to give her a great Christmas, so after starting a new job this year where I could afford it I decided to treat her a little. I went slightly over budget on what I was planning to spend (my budget was around £250 whereas I spent £350-£400 over the course of around three and a half months).  Her mum asked me to tell her what I got her so she doesn’t get the same as me, so I sent her the list, and she told her how much I had spent. This led to a bit of an argument and her getting annoyed I spent that much (she has spent around £300 on me). I understand that we have other priorities to be saving for, such as saving to move in together, and saving for a car, as well as a couple of holidays we have, and I don’t feel like the amount I spent is unwarranted as she asked for a lot of the things I got and I feel like the others are quite meaningful.  So AITA for spending more than I should have? I know she isn’t in the wrong for this and is entirely justified saying what she did but I just wanted to give her a good Christmas, maybe in the process I lost myself a little and got carried away?\n",
      "I went no contact with my sister early 2019. I heard through others she wanted me to be a bridesmaid for her wedding, after us going no contact.  I told them I'm not interested, I'm not going.   I saw sister at a family function about a month before her wedding. Sister directly asks me to be her bridesmaid. I say no. Sister directly asks if I want to even attend. I say no.  Wedding day passes without much incident. At least I think so.   My dad is furious we still haven't made amends. Freaks out when I go permanent no contact with sister. Sends me a letter that includes (among a series of other things) blaming me for  ruining my sister's wedding .   Said that my absence ruined what would have  otherwise  been the happiest day of her life. And it was my job to extend an olive branch. He accuses me of being prideful and making a statement (what statement I don't know) by not showing up. And apparently him and many family members agree that my (well known in advance) absence stole the happiest day of her life.  TL;DR I didn't go to my sister's wedding. With plenty of notice I won't be there. Dad says I ruined her wedding. AITA?  Edit: INFO: I went no contact because of years of abuse I suffered from my sister (even as adults), enabled by my father. Final straw was she blamed me getting  possibly  engaged on her psychotic break.\n",
      "Okay so I have this friend and since I became close with her, she has consistently tried to make me feel less than her. Like last year I was doing better in a very hard class and she told me that I didn’t deserve my grades and just trying to take me down. So I became very cold to her and not caring about her at all, and everyone was calling me an asshole and that i was a horrible person.   So fast forward to this year, I tried to be very nice and we actually became very close until I started struggling with ADHD to the point I was almost failing my classes. I don’t usually open up to anyone if I’m struggling in school but i felt comfortable enough to talk to her about it and she started laughing at me and making fun of me to my face and told everyone else. So I was obviously pissed and told her that, and she gave me the bs apology of “i didn’t know it would hurt your feelings” as if making fun of someone struggling wouldn’t hurt. But I just gave up with trying to get her to understand, but her doing that caused me to not trust anyone and then I couldn’t trust my boyfriend or my best friend and it caused lots of issues. I felt like there was nothing I could do so I gave it some time (a couple months) and eventually started talking to her again, and the first thing she does when I start talking to her again is start arguments and make herself feel right and superior all the time (it wasn’t even a big argument that pissed me off it was Jsut her trying to push me down again)  Okay so i got pissed told her I needed some space from her, she asked why, and i kinda went off telling her that she tries to make herself feel superior by pushing everyone down and that she’s not a good person, but puts on this mask of being too vulnerable to know what she’s doing is wrong…etc.   And so after that she texts the only 3 people I am close with trying to turn them against me, but two of those people are saying that I shouldn’t have sent that and that she’s “too vulnerable” to say that stuff to, and that what I did was shitty. They keep saying she’s vulnerable because she’s struggling mentally and that gives her a freebie to be rude, but I am also not doing well mentally so why does it make it okay for her but not me?  Summary- I called my friend out for pushing me down constantly and now my friends are all mad because she’s “too vulnerable” to tell the blunt truth to\n",
      "UPDATE   I’m 45mins into the journey and she just reclined it without saying anything. And I know it sounds stupid but usually hate confrontational stuff like this so I’ve just tested up a bit. I feel stupid. But there’s nothing I can do.  So sometimes at the weekend I travel from London to my home town via bus to go and see my family. The journey is 2 hours and normally pretty painless.   I found my seat when I got on the bus (it’s a big coach) and saw that the lady in front of my would-be seat had her seat reclined all the way back (imagine an airplane style thing). I thought that’s OK, the seat next to me is free so I’ll sit in that and hope no one turns up.   Just my luck, they did.. so I moved to my actual seat and asked the lady if she would mind putting her seat up (I asked very politely) she proceeded to huff and puff whilst she did it and said did she have to. I said yes I will have no space otherwise and it’ll be really claustrophobic. Still huffing and puffing she suggested (actually probably more ordered) I put my seat back so then I’d have space too.  I said that would require the person behind me, and behind them, and so on, to do the same - which not everyone wants to do. She was still muttering and I said look I just think it’s a bit anti social.. she responded saying I was incredibly rude (woah good argument) THEN I sassed again (oops) and said, well I don’t think you would do this on an airplane would you, and she was just silent.   5 mins later she turned around and muttered at me AGAIN saying I was rude but I just ignored her.   AITA for asking her to do put her seat upright and responding (with a cohesive argument) to what she said to me?  EDIT: it also prevents me from getting my dinner out my bag because it’s under the fully reclined seat  cry\n",
      "Just for some background information, me and my friend went to the mall the day before this happened where she bought me a jacket;  After that, we decided it would be nice to bus to school together. School starts at 8:47 and so we agreed to meet up at around 8:10. She told me she was at the convenience store getting some stuff, which was fair, but later when it was nearing time to leave, she still wasn’t nearby. I asked her if it was alright if I catch the next bus, (I’d already been late to class too much, a few more times and I can get suspended). She texted me it was okay, and so i apologized and went on the bus. About 5 minutes later she tells me that she doesn’t like me, and that i should feel bad for her. She also mentioned how she wanted the jacket she got me back, I wasn’t sure if she was serious or not. I still wanted to make it up to her so I bought her some food, which she threw away. Now she won’t speak to me. I asked what I can do to make it up to her, and she told me to leave her alone, which I am now. So, am I the asshole in this situation?\n",
      "My Mother talked to me last week about wanting to move my Grandmother who has severe Dementia and Alzheimer's into the house. My Grandfather isn't able to handle her any longer and can't find any outside help (for context, they live 7 hours away from us in a very secluded town. My aunt lives about a half an hour away but is not helping). I expressed my concerns and questions to her when she brought it up. My grandmother has been getting increasingly aggressive and has been leaving the house and walking on the road according to my grandfather. My Grandmother has no memory of who I am, my mother or my stepfather. Tonight, I had half jokingly asked when this was happening so I know when to move out. Poor choice of words in hindsight. My mother blew up on me turning to my stepfather and stating \"so much for having help with this\". Taking jabs at me stating that I don't help much around the house anyways and am up in my room most of the time anyways (I work from home upstairs in my bedroom). I tried to de-escalate the situation explaining that I'm not actually planning on leaving now however I don't know if I'm going to be able to handle the additional stress this is going to bring. She told me she doesn't care what I do and to move in with my friend or my father because \"they have better lives anyways\" and \"don't worry about us, we will handle this\" (in a sarcastic way) I feel incredibly guilty but I also don't because at the end of the day I truly don't reap comfortable being partially responsible for caring for my unstable grandmother. I don't know how to talk to my mother about this without it being escalated again.\n",
      "Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I (42f) have three children, \"Ava\" (14f), \"Thomas\" (11f) and \"Colm\" (8f). Colm does not come into the story.  Recently, Thomas has started drawing certain characters using YouTube tutorials during quarantine. For example, he's drawn characters such as Mario and Luigi, Sonic and Tails, Kylo Ren and Mike Wazowski. Up until recently he was using Crayola markers and pencils. Ava has been drawing for two years now, and is quite good at it. She has never used tutorials, only references at the start, and now only really draws original pieces. She has her own art Instagram account, (with over 200 followers) where she posts about her Original Characters, and maybe does commissions for family members every so often. She does these for free. She bought her own current set of markers from Amazon, and has had these for quite a while.  Recently, Ava asked me if I could maybe buy her some new markers as her current set were running out, and she had no money, and would pay me back when she could. She didn't want anything expensive, and knew what she wanted. She wanted a set of 51 alcohol based markers from Shuttle Art that cost $26.99. I said maybe, because that sounded quite expensive to me. She said OK, and left it at that.  Thomas asked me if he could get some new markers because he wanted real markers, not \"stupid crayola markers that are meant for babies\". I said yes. I asked which ones he wanted, and he said a set of 121 alcohol markers from Shuttle Art that cost $59.99. I told him that was too expensive, but I would get him the next lowest price, which was a set of 88 for $39.99. He agreed to settle.  I then remembered Ava, and I went to Amazon and got her a set of 40 for $15.  They both arrived in the mail yesterday, and when they came, Ava thought the more expensive ones were for her. I told her that no, the markers in the Amazon box were for her, and that her brother was the recipient of the Shuttle Art markers. She was a bit put off, but said nothing. Later on, she was being quite cold and distant with me, and when I asked why, she said it was quite annoying that her brother, who's been doing art for all of 3 months, got markers that were $40, whereas she, who's been doing art for 2 years, got markers that cost $15. I told her she was being ungrateful, and to be glad she got anything. Her brother also got in trouble for rubbing the expensive markers in her face.  Today, she's been refusing to talk to her me or her brother, and she hasn't left her room, except to eat.  I'm worried that I'm in the wrong here, so Reddit, AITA?  Edit: ok, so I'm TA. I'm going to return the $15 dollar set I got Ava and get her either what she wanted, or the one Thomas got. I would return Thomas's set, except he's already used them. I now realize what I did was wrong and I'm going to apologize to my daughter.\n",
      "Hi! I'd like to know if I was in the wrong for this.  My bf (41m) and I (31f) have been together for six months, and lived together for three. (I know, it's unusual, and yeah, it was a bad decision). Anyway, I have two kids from my first marriage (10f, 10f), and they live with us for two weeks out of every month.  I also have an Aunt \"Em\" that lives someplace else. Aunt Em loves my kids and they love her, and the other day we were texting and she mentioned picking them up from school this friday, so they can spend the weekend with her, so I accepted and told my BF about this.  Last night, though, Aunt Em texted me asking for the pickup and the weekend to be a surprise, to which I said yes. It was midnight, so BF asked who was texting me so late, and I replied that it was my aunt. I thought it was no big deal and I went to bed.  This morning, we were taking the kids to school and they mentioned wanting to do something for the weekend. BF was about to mention that they will go to Aunt Em's, and I remembered the surprise, so I gently squeezed his leg, and he understood and didn't mention it.  However, when the kids went inside the school, he blew up at me saying that he should not have been kept out of the loop, that I am being extremely disrespectful and prioritozing other people before him, that this hurt his trust and that apparently I just want him as a driver and provider, but don't care about him nor respect him enough to let him know about things. I apologized and told him that I did not mean to alienate him. I just figured I would tell him later in the day, or later in the week. I honestly did not think it was such a big deal, but I apologized around 4 or 5 times anyway, and he is still hurt and angry.  We had a fight two weeks ago and, since then, he is keeping score of how much he loves me. And this incident made me drop from an 89 to an 87, so, I'm doubting if I am TA or not.  AITA?\n",
      "WIBTA if I got my own wifi  Long time lurker, first time posting.   So basically, I (16F) live with my step mom and dad (both 50) and haven’t had internet in my room for the past year.   They have a bad internet provider, and we don’t live in a huge house or anything, but the internet doesn’t reach my bedroom. It’s been about a year and a half now of this, and anytime i’ve mentioned it to them it’s been a big fight with my dad yelling, my dad insulting me, and my step mom yelling and slamming things.   They ended up having my mom (50F) upgrade my phone plan with more data. I’ve been going through all of that (20 GBS/month) and been without data for about half the month as I have to use my data for any internet access. This also really effects my schooling as I do online school and will spend so much time waiting for anything to load. Keep in mind, I have ZERO internet in my room, the wifi name wont even show up on my phone.  So my mom messaged them a couple times asking about it nicely, and they didn’t respond.  Her and I ended up finding a good internet deal and ended up deciding that since they won’t help, the best course of action would be to get out of my current phone plan, downgrade to something less expensive, and get my own internet at the house (that she’ll pay for). This will total less than my phone bill over the course of a year.   WIBTA if i went through with it? I don’t want more fighting about this, I just want this issue sorted so I can get on with my life.  EDIT: Just wanted to say that my mom and I put an extender in before, and for whatever reason (either cause it was a couple years old or just because my internet is spotty anyways), it wasn’t working. Just wanted to mention as I saw many comments about this :) I also offered other prices on extenders for all budgets and my step mom and dad refused to help  EDIT 2: The plan would be under my mom’s name, not mine. Also just wanted to mention that for many complicated reasons, my dad and step mom currently rent the house that we live in from my mom\n",
      "My husband has T1D, which in case you didnt know, can be deadly in a very short period of time if his blood sugar drops.  To be vague, we were out somewhere on a walk, about 45 mins from civilisation & he began to have low blood sugar. He asked me for \"the food i brought\" & i said i didn't bring any. he got pretty mad & said that since i had the backpack & i usually bring food, i shouldve brought some in case he had low blood sugar.   I told him that while i usually do, its not my responsibility to maintain his diabetes just as its not his responsibility to carry my epipen (im anaphylactic to a few nuts)  luckily we found some other hikers who had some biscuits and he was fine but AITA for not bringing any food?\n",
      "I (26F) had a baby (A) at 17 who I gave up for adoption. I loved him but I wanted to go to uni and focus on my life before having my own kids. But A’s adoptive parents (B&C) let us have an open adoption. They are really nice and helped me a lot, I was in care and don’t really have any family and they did stuff like buy me house/kitchen items when I moved out and drove me to uni when I first started and stuff like that. I’ve not seen them in person much over the years cos I live a bit far away and we’re all busy but we keep in contact and I think of them like my relatives. A knows who I am and calls me Auntie my-name. Six months ago I had my own daughter with my fiancé (27M). I told B&C when I was pregnant and they congratulated me and asked me to send them my registry, and sent some very generous gifts (I know they’re pretty well off, but it was still a few hundreds pounds worth of stuff). We’ve FaceTimed since I had my baby and we’ve talked about meeting up again soon. My fiancé is really against it. He didn’t like them sending such expensive gifts and has said he finds it weird how we’re close. He’s now said that he doesn’t want them meeting our baby in person because he’s worried that they want to take her because they already have her “brother”. I’ve told him it’s ridiculous, they’re just being nice, they‘ve not said anything weird or even given any signs that they want another baby let alone ours (they already have a daughter who they fostered-adopted). He insists that if I keep calling them and sharing photos of her and especially if I go to meet them I’m not respecting his fears and he’s just trying to keep our daughter safe and he’s allowed to have equal input and on who’s allowed to meet her and who is allowed to get pictures of her. AITA?\n",
      "I (20 F) and my boyfriend (21 M) celebrated our one year together a few months ago. On our anniversary he gifted me a thick silver bracelet that I could tell he put a lot of thought into. I was so appreciative that he took time and effort to pick something so thoughtful but I hardly ever wear it. I’ve always only worn gold and dainty jewelry but this is entirely the opposite. Even when I opened the gift he acknowledged the fact that I only ever wear gold but he said he thought it would look nice on me. In the beginning I would try to put outfits together with it and I just realized I don’t really like it at all which I feel terrible about. I still wear it occasionally when we are together but it’s just not really my style. He’s never pushy by telling me to wear it but he’s always so happy when I do and always notices. I just feel so guilty that I don’t love it even though I received this months ago. Aita?\n",
      "I value my privacy for many reasons.  None rise anywhere near the level of conspiracy theorist, and in fact, I even have FB and IG accounts.  I haven't updated them in nearly a decade and would actually like to delete them altogether.  However, every so often, old friends from the distant past will reach out via FB, so I like to leave that line of communication open for those who no longer have my phone number.  My wife, on the other hand, has different views regarding privacy.  She regularly posts on social media with her political beliefs, pictures of us, our life, our travels, etc.  For the most part, this does not really bother me.  While I would prefer some of that information remain private, I recognize that we live a shared life together, and those experiences are hers too.  Although she and I have talked about privacy matters, I do not impose my values on her.  My one request, however, is that if she would like to post an image of me, that I be afforded the opportunity to see it first.  My rationale is that I have a right to my privacy and how my image is portrayed publicly.  Now, I never really look at my wife's accounts (or any social media outside of reddit), but today a friend texted me about a picture she recently posted of me.  It depicts me in my pajamas, hair unkempt, and making a goofy face at home.  She thought it was cute; I found it a bit unflattering.  When I confronted my wife about it, she first denied agreeing to my request of viewing images first (she states she recalled the outcome of our conversation differently).  I set aside my feelings of frustration that our agreement was violated, and she still believes I am being irrational and controlling.  Her argument is that I am part of her life, and she is allowed to share her life publicly as she sees fit.  She is also offended that I do not trust her judgment.  My argument is that her rights end where my right to privacy begins, and this has nothing to do with trust or judgment.  So, reddit, AITA for asking my wife to check with me first before posting my picture online?  EDIT: before people start making assumptions about infidelity, no I am not flirting with women online.  I have absolutely zero issue with my wife using her account to post pictures of me or us together, so long as I can simply view the picture first.\n",
      "I'm (19M) currently on a family vacation with my mom's family including all her siblings and their spouses, my maternal cousins and my grandparents. My immediate family and my gf after also here.  This morning, my grandfather had a cardiac arrest. Thankfully, he survived and he's currently in hospital. I'm the only first aid trained person the family, so I was awoken by my girlfriend shaking me and then sending me to the kitchen where my grandfather (65) was.   My grandmother, father, uncle and mother were there. My girlfriend (17F) and my brother (18M) ran over to the local community center to ask to borrow the defibrillator in case 911 took a while.  I began chest compressions on my grandfather. The issue here is I have very weak lungs because of asthma. I don't think I'm able to perform the kiss of life properly. My uncle (45M) and father (45M) were going to be alternating chest compressions with me every two cycles. My mother (42F) is also very asthmatic. My grandmother (65F), however, is not and she is avid swimmer. So, I asked her to do the rescue breaths for me. It was a bit chaotic, but it worked. I did the first two rescue breaths, got winded, and then I said 'Granny can do the rescue breaths for the rest of the cycles. I don't feel like kissing my grandad anymore'. It was a joke in an attempt to keep myself from losing my shit.  My grandma stopped crying to laugh, and she did the breaths successfully. My mother and father laughed a little too, but my uncle remained silent. I've heard stories of older people passing out and having cardiac arrest themselves when their spouse is in danger, so I thought that asking my grandma to do something would prevent that.   My gf and brother returned with the defib, my girlfriend used an electric razor to get the hair off, we shocked him twice and he was back. Emergency services took a while because we're in a rural area but he was awake and kinda alert when they got to us.   Once my grandad was safe at hospital, my uncle pulled me aside and said my joke this morning was inappropriate. I agreed that it may have been ill-timed, but it made my grandmother and mother stop crying to laugh.  We argued a bit, and he called me an asshole.  AITA?\n",
      "So I dated this guy for a couple months, but we were flirty for awhile before we could actually date because he worked in the donations department of the college I was going to, and there’s a blanket rule you can’t date students.   We broke up in May, and after some time, he decided he still wanted to be friends and keep a group chat that consisted of his friend, another friend (my ex I’m still friendly with) him, and me. I’m pretty ambivalent at this point, but sure, why not.   Flash forward to yesterday, and my friend posted on Facebook about how she got a new job. Cue a bunch of congrats comments plus his comment that’s generally congratulatory but also adds that another company is superior in parentheses.   Cue me messaging the friend with the new job like wtf why would he even say that. This person is my friend who he met through me, and she agreed that it came off more like her boomer aunt than a joking comment. She wanted to tell him to fuck off, but didn’t want her future employers seeing it. I told her I’d send him a message, and she said to go for it.   Me; Fuck off. You sound like your parents boomer friends who insult your “childish” purchases when you say that other company is superior. You don’t know [friend’s name] well enough to pull that off as a joke.   Him: Jesus. A simple “she probably didn’t/won’t find that funny would’ve sufficed.”   Me: So would have a “congratulations”   Then he reacts not with any textual communication, rather he deleted himself from aforementioned group chat and me from Facebook. Pretty much implies the friendship’s over which is fine by me, but I gotta know, AITA?\n",
      "ETA 2.0: Reached out to the bridesmaid to let her know that I won’t be going with her artist due to price and style, but that’s she’s welcome to hire whomever she needs to make her feel gorgeous as long as whoever I hire doesn’t have an exclusivity clause. I appreciate the tough love and perspective.   ETA: damn, nobody prepares you to be the asshole when you post these 😅 I really appreciate the perspective and humbling y’all are giving to bring me back to reality. I’ll be rolling with some of y’all’s suggestions to make sure we all feel and look as radiant as we should. ❤️  I (26F) am getting married this fall and my fiancé and I are planning for a short engagement and a lot of the great vendors for price:quality ratio are already booked. My budget is turning out to be tight compared to our area’s average rates and I’m struggling to find somebody we all like. The girls are just myself and three bridesmaids and three of us are your run of the mill drugstore shades in makeup but one of my bridesmaids is Latina and has a darker complexion.   This bridesmaid has vetoed all four artists I’d suggested seriously (after research and making sure they were good), some because of price and some because she didn’t like their limited profiles with people of the same skin type and tone (fair - valid concern). She’s expressed that she’s fine not using somebody if everybody else likes and uses them, but she’s said she would hire and bring in her own artist for this.   My issue is that I feel like that’s just not something one does as a bridesmaid in a wedding. My MoH has brought up concern with this as well, but I’m still on the fence about if I’d be a Bridezilla for asking her to go with the same person as everyone else, get done up somewhere before arriving, or do herself up.   I feel like bringing in her own person is maybe diva-ish (like two steps down from being a diva) and also disrespectful to whoever the rest of us hire especially in such a small wedding party.   So….WIBTA if I asked her not to bring in her own artist?\n",
      "(had to exclude small details due to word count but the meat is there)  Me (F15) my aunt (F50) and mom F(40) and brother (M17) were all playing Mario party tonight. If you’re unfamiliar it’s basically like a classic board game electronically with mini games and such. We went into the game choosing 20 turns which is estimated to be 1 hour.   It ended up taking 3 AND A HALF HOURS to complete the game. Reasons? Number 1, learning the controls. I totally get not understanding how to work the game, especially for some adults who didn’t grow up with that stuff.   I was happy to oblige teaching them how to play, but it soon developed into spending 5 minutes a turn looking at every little thing before deciding to roll the dice normally. Then frustrated yelling about not understanding how to play. I would calmly try and tell them how it works and get no gratitude or patience. Instead just frustrated whining. Then proceeded to ask me again 2 rounds later.  Number 2, as time went on, both were drinking heavily. My family is extremely annoying and insufferable when drinking. As they kept drinking, they got slower and thought process slowed. This repeated step 1 numerous times. If I had shown ANY bit of frustration or anger I would get told off that I’m overreacting or I’m being negative for no reason. Even though they would both be whiny with me that “the game doesn’t work” “what am I pressing” please stop yelling at me I’m trying my best  I had the worst headache because of this, and I was on the verge of tears several times. Everytime i would complain about what was happening my aunt, would say I’m getting angry over nothing, disregard my feelings, and say I should enjoy spending time with family.   I went to leave to check on my neighbors dogs and they wanted me to start a new game. Ok, fine. I was then teased about being angry and basically told them why I was mad. I had ended with “Drunk people just make me angry.” And my aunt had gotten offended “Oh so drunk people like your mom and me?” YES. YOU HAVE BEEN DRINKING ALL NIGHT. NOBODY ELSE HERE IS DRUNK OR CAN LEGALLY DRINK.  I was just really sick of being there, so I mumbled sorry and went to leave. I was left with the closing remark of “Oh my god, we have never done anything to you.”  And that just. Broke me. I left the house crying, because they had done something to me. I was very upset with how the night went and I’m frustrated and angry over everything.  So Reddit, AITA?  Edit: I’ve gotten one comment saying I’m the asshole, one saying I’m not, and one saying everyone sucks here. not sure what the verdict is but I think at the moment it’s ESH.\n",
      "A less than good-looking middle-aged American man said this to me today: “You are very pretty for a British woman”. So he set the bar really low, then put me slightly above it. On behalf of British women, his comment was a back-handed complement at best, and a general insult to British women at the very least. AITA for being pissed-off with his comment?\n",
      "Long story short my ex and I had a less than amicable break up, and she continued to bother me until finally I told her to stay out of my life and that I never want to talk to her again.  About a month ago I was on bumble dating and a profile for her popped up.  She has a history of cheating, and cheated on anyone she has dated, myself included.  Would I be an asshole if I messaged this guy through an anonymous insta account to tell him?  Idk if they have some situation worked out or whatever, but I felt i would have wanted someone to tell me when she was cheating on me.  But I’m just torn if I should just stay out of it, or help a potentially oblivious guy out.  Unfortunately I forgot to take a screenshot so I don’t have the proof :/  Edit- yeah I agree with the consensus.  I didn’t really want to tell her, as I wanted to stay out, but just felt bad for the poor guy.  But I shall leave myself out of it.  Thanks\n",
      "I mean carpets: area rugs, wall-to-walls, etc. Throwaway account to hide my identity.  Since I was a little kid I have hated the feeling of rubbing my hands or feet (skin in general) against most kids of carpet. Getting carpet up in between a very short nail and the finger skin is especially upsetting. When a carpet is rubbed in my presence my skin crawls.  Maybe this is like what nails against a chalkboard is for some people, or knives against plates, or being tickled against your will. It is sooo uncomfortable to me.  I do enjoy the beauty of area rugs, and the warmth and insolation they provide, so I have some in my house and I usually wear slippers or flip flops when I'm walking on them. My aversion to carpet-rubbing has never been a problem--until now. Sure, my siblings used to rub and scratch carpets around me on purpose to horrify me, and I would close my eyes and cover my ears until it stopped. But in regular life, regular walking, regular interactions with carpets, everything has been fine. If someone happened to rub their bare foot back and forth against a carpet, I would flinch and ask them to stop, as it made me deeply uncomfortable. They would stop - perhaps bewildered - but respect my wishes nonetheless.  This brings us to my boyfriend. He things it is unreasonable for me to ask him not to rub carpets around me. He says that this makes him feel like he is walking on eggshells when near a carpet. I have told him that if he walks normally there really isn't a problem. Sometimes when he's sitting on a carpet he'll absent-mindedly rub his hands back and forth. I will wince and ask him to stop, and he does. I will admit that I have shot daggers at him with my eyes. I think that I can be more sensitive about the  way  I ask him to stop rubbing a carpet in the moment, but I don't think it's unreasonable for me to ask him to stop, since it bothers me so much.  He says it is unreasonable to expect other people to change they way they walk and touch carpets just because I have a weird tick (when he walks normally there is no problem). I say that he doesn't need to worry about changing so much, that I expect he'll forget himself sometimes, and just to stop when I ask. I think that the fact that I am uncomfortable should be enough - shouldn't he want me to feel good? Why does it matter to him so much to rub a carpet? And I've never had this issue before -- I don't expect people to change how they walk, but I guess I do expect them to care that I am uncomfortable? Is asking someone not to rub a carpet around me unreasonable like he says it is? He thinks it is unfair of me to ask this of him, and that I should get over it and practice being OK with carpet-rubbing. He says that me asking him to stop rubbing carpets makes  him  feel uncomfortable and that I should respect  that.   Reddit please help us.  Edit to say that this has only happened like 6 times, it's not a constant thing. And when it happens my reaction is to cover my ears and shut my eyes and maybe go \"ahhhhhh\" or \"noooo\".  I'm never angry about it.   TL;DR: My boyfriend thinks it is unreasonable for me to ask him to stop rubbing carpets with his hands and feet because it makes my skin crawl. Who is the AH here?\n",
      "As some background, I’m 22 year old soon to be 23 in 2 weeks female. Growing up my mom wasn’t horrible, but she wasn’t the best either yet we were close. Everything changed when I turned 18. I moved 11 hours away and after a year I decided to move to the state in which my dad lives, because I didn’t see him a lot growing up. My mom was furious and has been manipulative, controlling and shit talking my dad ever since. Often times our phone calls end with me in tears and then we don’t talk for weeks.  At one point during a depressive episode of mine she even convinced me to fly to visit her, then took my phone and said if I tried to leave she’d call the cops and have me put in a mental hospital. When I managed to escape, she called the police and tried to file a missing persons report and also tried to get my boyfriend at the time in trouble with his job for abusing me (he wasn’t)  We did not speak for a year and even after I forgave her things were rocky. Recently she let me know my grandma has lung cancer and probably won’t be around for more than 6 months. While I was sad I wasn’t as sad as most people would be. My relationship with my grandparents isn’t that great either. Their idea of love is tossing you a check your birthday and Christmas but never calling and I got tired of being the only one who cared to call.  My mom who lives far away wanted to know if she could come stay with me because my grandpa would not let her stay at their house but my mom still wanted to visit my grandma. (I live about 40 minutes from my grandparents) I reluctantly said yes, then a few weeks later said that my step dad and their dog would also be coming. I live in a 1 bed 1 bath apartment with 2 dogs of my own and my boyfriend so there was no room for that many visitors. On top of that, she asked to speak to my boyfriend and wound up over sharing with him about our family and even my relationship with my ex. When I told her to stop and that didn’t need to be discussed she got angry with me and we wound up arguing. Later she texted me telling me to never speak to  her again because I’m insensitive without a heart. This is not the first time she’s texted me something like that so I just blocked both her and my step dad.  A few days ago my step dad made a Facebook page and messaged me telling me it’s nice that I’m only an hour away and won’t speak to my mother, so apparently they found somewhere else to stay but I didn’t know because I blocked them.  AITA for blocking them when my family is going through a hard time? My mom is crazy but I know she loves me and her own mom is dying. I feel very guilty but my mom has caused me a lot of stress and heartache and Idk if I can keep letting it happen. Should I suck it up this time because of my grandma ?\n",
      "So before my gf and I moved in together back in November she had to deal with her last roommates being really shady, not to mention they were a couple. Essentially when their lease ended they became really shady like asking her for more money for bills than she actually owed as well as not paying bills on time, never cleaning after their big dog, and basically forcing her to move out to make room for one of their sisters. I was on her side and with her the whole time she went through hoops to get the money they owed her back and moving out. She made it clear that she doesn’t want anything to do with them again or hear their names, although we worked with one of them and seeing her was inevitable. So last Friday I ran into her ex roommates at the store and when they saw me they waved hi, so I just decided to wave back and generically say “uhh what’s up” to make things not awkward. My gf brought up one of them last night so I told her I ran into them a couple of days ago and they said hi. She got upset that I would say anything other than “F*** off” to them and turned it into a “they put me through hell who’s side are you on?” Just by saying hi? I wasn’t sure how to defend myself other than “they saw me and waved I didn’t see them and go up to them”. She was really upset and I think she still is wanted to see it I’m the Asshole?\n",
      "I've (21F) lived in an apartment with my bf (21M) for 2 1/2 years out of our 4 year relationship. We live in a high traffic area and our apartment is almost attached to the main road. The only thing between us and the street is my neighbor and a large lawn attached to a public sidewalk.  We live in a somewhat poor area. Tires get slashed, a lot of junkies and homeless walk around our doors. It's not dangerous, just makes you not want to be outside. So I want potty trips to be quick.  I take my XS dog (her head doesn't go past my shin and she weighs 6lbs at most) out to do her business in the public lawn by the road. It's more like community grass but it's still in touch with my neighbor so it's also a part of the complex. Nobody walks through this grass. It's for show and there are no parks or kids around us. When my dog poops on the grass closest to the sidewalk portion, I don't pick it up. We have gardeners that come every Wednesday and the blow everything into the gutters and my dog's business is so small it almost doesn't feel worth it.  With that said, I do still carry dog bags with me on the occasion she poops too close to a neighbor. I don't let her go to the bathroom at all if it's clearly someone's boundary. I do pick up her poop when it's too close to people or when we go for walks. I just don't when it's in this particular \"free for all\" area. Nobody around the grass goes outside, and when they do, they're in the spot where I don't let my dog go anyways. I've set an agreement with my neighbor that I won't let my dog on half of the \"free for all\" grass since it's technically attached to his window (but it's not his). Thus why I only let her go on the lower half portion.  Overall, I've never had a serious issue with my neighbors but I feel they're overreacting when they watch me from their windows. I have two different people watching me, even coming to their screen doors to watch me take my dog out and one following me with a car. I haven't had any complaints on me though, because my complex would let us know by leaving letters. Also, there is another neighbor I have next to me who has 3 dogs. They're the loud, angry chihuahua mixes. He lets them poop anywhere and everywhere. I've had one poop on my outdoor mat before. I'd see if I was an issue if my dog was loud and obnoxious, but she's well behaved and doesn't bark.  Anyway, AITA?  Kinda figured I would be based on the principle that you should always pick up your dog's poop. I just live in an area that doesn't take it seriously.   EDIT [For the love of God please read before you comment, this is pretty much settled] : Yeah I'm the asshole. I knew I would be, I wanted to solidify it in my head so I don't keep making excuses to myself. You're right, I have and use bags anyway, I just get lazy. Thanks for calling me out, I needed the wakeup call. Thanks to all those that commented, that was fast! Also to the person who said I probably leave shopping carts out too, I wish I could respond to you directly but I can't find the comment. But no I don't leave carts out, I still walk them back lol.   EDIT TL:DR : I have dog bags. Yes I use them. Not all the time, hence why I'm the asshole.\n",
      "Obligatory am on mobile  Also I'm bad at English in general  Context: I'm a very young kid, still living with my parents, and in my family we share most of the stuff we have. I'm an alleged germaphobe, and I don't like sharing the stuff I have  So the story is that a while back I received so really nice new slippers from my stepdad as a gift for not being a terrible spawn of hell, and I really liked it.   A while later, I noticed my grandparents and my mom walking around in it a lot. I get annoyed and ask them to stop, as I just don't like sharing footwear. Especially with the feet that sometimes go barefoot in the kitchen. They don't stop, and they lecture me instead on family and stuff and how I shouldn't care about germs.   This goes on for a while, up to just a few months ago, when the thing disappeared. Now I get pretty angry over this, and I would bring it up. It only ends with arguments. Just earlier today I asked my mom if I could have new slippers, and I asked for 2 rules. To have it be mine, and to have it be comfy. She gets mad, and we got into a really big fight. Now I'm looking back and wondering if my choices were the right ones. I did take some drastic actions in between, like have a conversation about germs to my family, but I didn't like having to share even my water bottle with them.  AITA?  Edit: I just realized how strange this sounds, but my mom said that the germ thing with me severed our relationship and now I would be considered an American stranger to them.  Update: mom said that as long as I can't support myself and get a house, everyone's sharing evrtything\n",
      "So I had a not bad upbringing but not normal upbringing so I had my biological dad (k age 35) and my mum (h age 37) and my step dad (j age idk) so k and h split up before I was born but I always saw him twice a week and he paid child support and stuff like that Then h met j when I was still a baby and got married and I changed my name to just last name and everything in my eyes both of them where my dad's   So for the longest time I'm going to say 4 years h and j didn't get along idk what it was but h had an abusive upbringing so she handled things the opposite way so j would start and argument and h would just not say anything for fear of causing chaos   In October I went on holiday with k and his wife and my sisters and when I came back my mum (h) called me in the car saying you've to get dropped of at your grans (I hadn't spoke to my gran since 2019 here) so I got dropped of and my mum (h) informed me j had left and we had no money so I was upset and I had the flu so it was just horrible   So another factor to add to this is I have suffered from bad mental health since I was 3 I've always had anxiety and ocd but when all this happened it got so much worse and j was the only person in my house that drove,had a job or got any income whatsoever so I had to get the train to school and I ended up falling really ill and I was just feeling horrible all the time in constant panic attacks and constantly had migranes   So I was sitting in English and my friend (s age 16) said \"why don't you just message him like he is still your dad\"  And I said no he hurt me and he hurt my mum and she ended arguing with me saying all this stuff when it was really none of her business  But thinking about aita for not wanting to speak to him\n",
      "I'm throwing a Harry Potter-themed party next month for friends of mine who are serious fans.  I'm going all out - candles hanging from the ceiling, a Platform 9-3/4 backdrop, photo props for the \"Have You Seen This Wizard?\" and \"Undesirable No. 1\" posters.  I'm sending guests invitation letters and train tickets on paper that looks like parchment and using a Hogwarts seal on red wax.  I ordered wooden dowels to make wands, antique glass bottles and different colored mica to make potion bottles, and I'll be providing food, \"Honeydukes\" sweets, and alcoholic butterbeer.  I'm also hand-making my own Cards Against Wizardry deck, having a Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Bean face-off, and doing a house-team trivia game.  All of the supplies will probably cost close to $300, which is a lot for me.  It's not the kind of party where gifts are expected, but because people will get to take home wands and potion bottles, would I be an asshole for asking each guest to pay $10?  Edit:  Guests whom I've discussed the party with on FB have agreed to attend and know that this is going to be lavish and that they'll be making wands and getting acceptance letters (the potion bottles will be a surprise).  Edit No. 2:  Two of the people planning to attend went with me to Harry Potter bar crawl last spring.  We paid $35 to go and all we got was a chintzy plastic cup and a lightning bolt temporary tattoo.\n",
      "I have a certain workflow when I sweep the floor...I’ve got it down to an exact science. I divide the floor into sections. E.g kitchen island area is one section, then living room area is another section, so on and so forth. Then I always sweep horizontally towards the middle .And I ALWAYS do under the tables/chairs/sofa last. I’ve been doing this since I was a kid and it’s always worked for me haha. But my SO loves to make side comments while I’m sweeping and it’s annoying. Like for example they’ll say that I forgot to do under a chair and I said no I didn’t I leave it for last. I’ve asked them to refrain from the behavior and sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.  Anyways today I was doing the sweeping after breakfast and i was following my workflow as usual. So my SO points out that I forgot the table. I said no I didn’t. 2 minutes later the same thing happens again, “oh you forgot that chair”. “No I didn’t I’m doing it last”. A couple minutes later the same thing happens again. “You forgot under that chair, it’s like you weren’t even listening to me”. I had it and I said I do this shit every single time like are you not paying attention ? I haven’t even finished sweeping the section yet before I get under the chair like what’s your issue, can you not just leave me alone to do it how I like to do it? They got upset and said they’re just trying to help and I said yea I get that but we’ve had this discussion so many times like why do we keep talking about this. Just leave me alone to sweep how I like to. They just walked off in a huff and said they’re just trying to help but I don’t want their help I just want to be left alone to sweep.\n",
      "Posting on behalf of my friend;  AITA for telling my father my potential plans before I fly back home?  A bit of backstory; I (F30) have my father (M54) and step-mom (F43) are divorced with a kid (M8). They have my little brother 50/50 of the time. It is my step-moms birthday next week and I fly home at the end of the week.  I had lunch with my father and when discussing my plans before I flew home, I mentioned I was going to spend time with my step-mom and brother before I went back. My father asked me at the time if he could join, to which I responded, \"No, it is not my decision. You will have to call her and ask, since it is her birthday.\" He accepted this and moved on.  The following day, my step-mom called me and angrily shouted at me for some time for telling my dad what my plans were. She said it was unfair that I told him my plans. She told me that I am 30 years old, and I should start to act like it. I responded by saying that I wouldn't lie to my father about potential plans for no reason. She then told me that I was inconsiderate for texting and asking about her birthday instead of calling. I do not see this as an issue as we use messaging as a form of communication, but she was annoyed by this. I have since spoken to my dad and told him that he could not attend the birthday gathering, and we could see each other at another time before I left, which he accepted.  Not only that, but I feel like she is being extremely childish about this whole situation, and she is annoyed because ultimately, she is unable to say no to someone.  AITA?\n",
      "Ok, my girlfriend is leaving the country for 6 months, and she will be flying out tomorrow. This morning at the hotel, as we are getting breakfast her friend showed up, I saw him but said nothing and I don't think my girlfriend knows that i saw him. Imitiatly she wants to go back to the room \"to check her eyes\". I said ok, and I got breakfast. After she came back I asked her what's wrong, and not surprising, she said something is bugging her eyes. I said just, tell me the truth and what is wrong. She just said the same thing.   I got up and went back to the room. Last night I was at work till 11 and she apparently at a work party. She didnt drive and said her friend got an uber for her. So, it got me thinking. Why would she lie to me.  When she got back then she confessed, said her friend is just dropping off flowers and wants to say goodbye. I said fine, just let me check your phone.   She refused.   Shes actually going to new York for a week before she leaves the country, we planned to meet up before she actually leaves.   I told her, I will cancel my flight if you don't let me check you phone. And she still want budge.   AITA for pulling this out right before she leaves? But at the same time, I don't know if I can trust her.\n",
      "A little background. I work for a company that sells home appliances. Few days ago I got an email from work that we are clearing some old cooktop stock (first come first serve with limited stock) these are at cost price so it is like $100 vs $800 RRP and for a couple of days I've been thinking if I should get it since our one is working fine (just a little worn). Today I did some research at work and I've decided to get it since there was no way I could get it at that price if I wanted to buy it later.   Now, I (36M) love my wife (33F) and she is wonderful but everyone has something that can annoy their significant other. For her, she doesn't like to be asked what to do, she finds excuses not to do it. i.e. she can drive but she will never drive if I am with her or to go buy food, chores etc. unless she has no other alternative. She will not even call to order take out or even pick up the order if I am around. There are many other instances that really shits me because the task is so small, simple and yet, she just refuses to do it.  So here's what happened. She works from home and she is also looking after our 9 month old. I SMS her and ask when she can, could she measure the length and width of our cooktop. She replied back that she is busy and I should do it when I get home. I got annoyed and said it literally takes 30sec to measure it, you got a whole day to get to it and why do you always make things harder than it is, it is so annoying.   She got mad at me and said that I think she do nothing. She is busy with the baby and work. I left it as that cause I know I might say something later that I regret and upset her.  I know this shouldn't even be an argument, but it is not about her not being able to measure it for me. It's the fact that she makes things harder than it is, and it's always a battle for me to ask her to do anything.   AITA here? I just can't comprehend why it would be an issues to do someone a favor that takes literally 30sec. No matter how busy I am, I can always take a few min aside to do something if some one asked me to.\n",
      "So me and this boy I’ve liked for a little while have been talking more recently. I’m not all THAT ugly, but many people specifically the “popular girls” consider me a hoe/whore because of the way I dress and how many people I’ve dated. I tend to go towards crop tops, skinny jeans, but that’s not my entire wardrobe which is mostly sweatshirts.  (Also it could be the fact that many guys have liked me since transferring to the school this year)  Normally I honestly wouldn’t care, but the guy I like mentioned that he wouldn’t go out with me with him friends knowing or dance with me at dances since it would “ruin his rep” because his friends think I’m a whore.  This kind of rubbed me wrong and I don’t know if I should be pissy over this comment or simply just ignore it.....  He’s normally not a bad guy or tries to be hurtful, he’s a sweet, funny, kind person but I don’t know if he realizes that what he said kinda sucked.  AITA for wanting to stop talking/interacting with this guy over the comment? Or WIBTA if I wanted to approach him over this?   Edit: spelling errors\n",
      "I f 20 artist am trying to figure out what I should do, my friend sent a dpick and I haven’t replied at all.  He tried to apologize sort of? but I don’t think he understands what kind of confusion and distraught this caused me until I found this solution.. the beautiful solution   so I photoshopped the sausage in question on a cartoon horse in a style similar to my little pony that I’ve drawn with the caption (in rolled blunts) “yarr we be even now noodle boi” the shaping being where a unicorn horn would be. It’s a very cute character other than the shlong with a sparkly eye patch and everything 10/10 my best work   But I think I went too far with the eyepatch... and the fact that it’s a dong but he sent it to me in the first place and it wouldn’t go anywhere else and I think it would be a good lesson and something to laugh about as friends but it may be a b too far? I don’t know how else to reply to that sort of thing  Would I be the asshole? I could change the caption to s’ghetti man instead of noodle boi  Update I ended up not sending him the picture i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesn’t even matter. I just blocked him, the crowned jewel pixel painting will soon be deleted after I print it out and give it a (origami boat)Viking funeral in the honour of my once remaining sanity It will be set alight at sea for then, may his manhood be found hot by anything at all, before alas, getting wet  I CAST THY OUT TO DROWN IN THE FIRES OF MY FURRY!!!!\n",
      "This was a while ago but I'm curious what Reddit has to say. I'm in my 20s, and I'm friends with this elderly woman from my hometown. She told me her friend, K, who is about the same age as her, needed help with some internet stuff and asked if I'd do it as a favor. I was unemployed at the time so I said sure.  I went over to see what K needed. K was pretty grumpy and a very avid trump supporter, which my friend did not think to warn me about. I am gay and was living in a small town so this is a group of people I generally try to avoid. K didn't say anything rude to me but I was pretty tense. She basically needed help putting her small business up for sale on a couple local sale boards, would not have taken me a long time at all. She gave me some of her basic information and we planned a day where I could sit down and help her.  That day comes around, I text K to ask if we're still meeting, she tells me she's busy and to plan another day. This happens one or two times. Eventually I lose contact with her. Then I start a new full time job and am not around my hometown very often anymore. She texts me after a month asking if I can still help her. I basically told her no I am busy with work now and blocked her number, never heard from her again. My old lady friend has never brought it up to me again, so I think she may have forgotten.  So Reddit, AITA? I feel like I could have handled the situation better.\n",
      "I’m in college and I thought I was close with my group of friends. At the beginning of spring semester last year a girl (Sally) entered the group and was talking to one of the guys (John). They didn’t workout because they fought over everything, still friends.   Little background: I tend to be a physical friend with my guy friends so we fight a bit but like boys will do.   A few months after this the guys of the group start shipping me and Sally since we get along. I told them I really wasn’t that interested in her like that but they would not drop it. Took summer classes along with a few others of the group. Sally is a part of this and is living with Alice. Me and Colin are living together close to them so we spend a lot of time the four of us. Sally and Alice have a falling and summer ends.   Fall semester this year, me and sally spend a lot of time together and the rest of the group spots using the group chat. When we’re we hang out I get teased about Sally since we spend so much time and mutual friends start asking if we’re a thing. I find out that the guys in the group are hanging out without me, so I stop talking to them as much. Sally is hard to get along with sometimes so she gets the silent treatment from the guys, I try to be there for her cause I spent my freshman year alone and understand the pain. Whenever Sally or I try to organize some things to do we never get responses and it ends up just being us two. John plans somethings here and there and everyone hangs.   Spring semester this year Sally’s old friend, Frances, starts hanging out with me and Sally. There’s basically two factions in the group, team A (Sally, me, Greg, and Frances) and team B (John and the rest of the guys). Greg in the group has a crush on Frances, the four of us spend some time together. Sally starts ignoring me out of the blue, I have no clue why. I leave all the group chats and ignore all text or calls from the group. As soon as I drop them, they all start hanging out again and doing the things I wanted to do in the fall semester. They’re constantly hanging out in Colin and my apartment till late at night. They get loud so I tell them to be quiet and sometimes me and John “fight”. This goes on for three months I haven’t talked to any of them. On the few occasions that we do hang no one talked to me or tried to interact with me. Sally and Frances have a falling out.   Sally is transferring so I feel like I should make up with her and while I’m at it everyone else. Talked to John and felt like we worked things out. Apologized to Sally bit haven’t gotten a chance to talk it out. Finals week is making it hard make time and meet up with anyone. Sally and John are really the only people I need to “talk” with and make amends. I’m just tired of trying to be friends with people who aren’t putting in the same effort.\n",
      "My birthday was a few days ago and it was important for me this year given the pandemic, my health issues, and my first year in college. My mom wished me a happy birthday, gave me a gift, and even gave me money to buy a birthday cake (just for me and my family to have), since she has to go to work and doesn’t have time to get one. I was so grateful for this. When my dad came home, I asked him for a ride to get my birthday cake. The snow and the pandemic made me fearful of walking or using public transport. He did not acknowledge my birthday, which I brushed off to him being tired from work, but then realized he simply didn’t care when he explicitly said my birthday didn’t mean anything and he wasn’t going to get it. I’m sensitive so I obviously got upset over this and have ignored him since. It’s just the fact that I didn’t ask for him to wish me a happy birthday, or get a gift, or anything of the sort besides giving me a ride (which would’ve taken 20 mins tops) to get a cake. I’ve honestly NEVER asked him for anything and it just hurts that any favor he asks me, I’d do it right away, yet he couldn’t bother to take 20 minutes out of his day so I can get a cake on my birthday.   I realize I could be an asshole for expecting him to do something, especially after he got off from work, but I feel like his comment was unnecessary and he could’ve just said he was tired if he’s tired? He did try to get me a cake the day after given how I reacted, but I felt like the damage was done and I couldn’t forgive him. I declined on the cake and now feel like I spent these past few days feeling like this was the worst birthday ever. I honestly can’t tell if I’m being spoiled and blowing this out of proportion or if my feelings are justified.\n",
      "I live in Europe  To shorten things up - I am a 25y.o young doctor to start my mandatory paid internship in October. My mom is a single mom and by having a child <26 not earning money, she can divide her income by half and thus pay a smaller tax. However, if I start earning money from October, it'll mean she will be transfered to a different tax group and pay a several thousand euro (can't assess exactly how much, my country has its own currency) more. Much, much more than I can earn in those three months.  Only in October can the young doctors start their internships. I have already finished all the paperwork and was happy to break free, start earning on my own and be totally independent. I can start working and make my life a bit more significant and fulfilling. However, yesterday she told me how the situation looks like and made me  feel guilty for not wanting to accomodate to her - by either taking an unpaid leave (I already plan to take it next year to do a part of the internship abroad - I am afraid they'd refuse if I took another leave) or somehow cancelling my internship. I offered to give her the money back some years later, but she only replied \"Listen how stupid you are\" and got very angry. In the end, I agreed to everything to make her calm down and retreated to my room.  I suffer from anxiety disorder, take medications, but this confrontation triggered a panic attack and I am still shaken up to this moment. My mom is also a doctor, but believed I have \"hysteria\" and that I'm making all this up for most likely attention or \"theatric behaviour\". I want to refuse and just  go on with my life, free, but ultimately costing my mother several thousand euros. We're a middle class and she's been providing for me for all those six years of uni, but I've waited for so long to be able to be independent and do something in my life other than studying that this single detail was the drop that made the cup run over. I am afraid that if I'll take the leave in October to December, my mental health will deteriorate. What will I be doing, sitting there idle, while everyone I know has a job?  &#x200B;  Will I TA if I refuse?\n",
      "So I have this friend. We’ve been friends for several years, and we have always gotten along really well. We even went on a trip to Europe together. About nine months ago she started seeing this guy. He’s nice enough; kind of boring, but nice. They are nothing alike in terms of taste and personality. She’s very well traveled and likes Shakespeare and going to the symphony and such, and he’s kind of a bumpkin? He likes NASCAR and shooting stuff. He’s also way younger than her. They don’t seem to have anything in common or any chemistry. But that’s just my impression.  Ever since they started dating, she has completely ignored all her other friends, myself included. I understand wanting to spend time with your boyfriend or girlfriend, but I’ve dated guys before, and I never neglected my relationships with my other friends. But she doesn’t return my calls or texts, except to make excuses for not hanging out. We had plans to go to a cool museum exhibition together, and she cancelled on me. I later found out that she went with her boyfriend anyway, without me.  I wasn’t surprised when they got engaged, although it was pretty damn quick. She asked me to be one of her bridesmaids, and I couldn’t say no, because I still care about her. I bought a bridesmaid dress and new shoes for the wedding. And then shortly after that, I found out from her dad that they had gone to the courthouse and gotten married. She didn’t even tell me.  I don’t even want to talk to her anymore. She was one of my best friends, but it seems to me that she was only using me, and her other friends, as stand-ins until she could find a man. She’s called and texted me, but I can’t bring myself to respond. Am I the asshole for not wanting to talk to her?\n",
      "I’m 19/F and my friend G is 18/F. I don’t get along with her very well, but I always try to be nice to her and help her when I can. She’s a bit rude (putting us down, threatening to “beat people up”, never saying thanks, crying when she couldn’t sit in the front seat, etc.) but I put up with it for the sake of my other friends.   Me, her, and two other girls agreed to room together in an apartment style dorm this coming semester, but one of the girls was not able to make it, leaving the three of us. I’m much closer to my other friend, so we agreed to room with each other and give G her own room and bathroom. G has said in the past that she hates rooms with windows and prefers darkness, whereas me and my other friend prefer window rooms, so we agreed that me and my friend would get the window room and the bigger bathroom since we have to share. We talked about this months ago and G was fine with this.  However, today was her move in day since she has a part time job at the school, but me and my other friend move in two weeks from now. She informed us via group text that she was indeed taking the window room AND the big bathroom. My friend and I were furious. I tried to reason with her, offered compromise by letting her have the room she wanted if we could have the big bathroom, but she wouldn’t budge. Her way of compromising was saying her dad told her she could have the room she wanted and that one of us could share the bathroom with her if we wanted to. We’ve sought out assistance from the person in charge of our dorm and they’ve told us to figure it out ourselves.   This is the part where I might be TA. Since she won’t listen and doesn’t care about what we want or agreed to, my friend and I are planning on no longer offering her free rides to places. She does not have a car and has always depended on us or her previous roommates for rides, and we will now be living in dorms 15 minutes away from the school. There is a shuttle that runs to the school and back, so she can go that way, although it is a bit unreliable. The only thing I’ll budge on is giving her rides to our marching band games so she can keep her scholarship, but she has to figure everything else out on her own. She’ll have access to food via the cafeteria, but if she wants to go to Walmart for something, she’ll have to figure it out on her own. We plan on telling her this soon so she has a heads up.   So, WIBTA if I refuse to give her rides?\n",
      "So a little context for this story, I was in 4th grade and this girl was is 5th. So to begin this girl who I will call “nugget” was mean to me and some of my other friends and classmates. It really made me mad but I was scared to fully express my emotions to nugget also I didn’t have the best reputation with older kids. For example when I was in 2nd grade this kid who was in high school kept on bullying me and one day when I went to his house to see my friend (high schoolers brother) we went into the pool and he and his friends started drowning me. But anyway long story short I was scared and defenseless so I grabbed a bat and started swinging it at them hoping it would scare them off. But anyways now that you know my reputation with older kids let’s continue the story. So one day the mean nugget has an emotional breakdown and all of her friends were gathered around her trying to comfort her. Then out of the blue she asked me “am I a good person?” Now keep in mind she has been being mean to me for the whole school year and I was little so I didn’t know how to bullshit so I told her “no you constantly bully me and my friends and make us feel like crap” this was not the answer nugget was hoping for. She started crying even more and honestly I had enough so I went out into the other room thinking of what I just done. The teachers really heard nugget’s side more so I got in trouble losing recess and then when I was sitting out her friends kept on picking and antagonizing me. To this day I really don’t know if I did the right thing, maybe I should have lied to her and say yes or just ignore the question. Please help me reddit. Also the reason I wanted to post this in the first place was because of R/slash really cool guy!\n",
      "I, 27f, have 3 kids (9m, 9f and 6m). I have been dating my BF (28m) for a little over 8 months. He has a 7yo daughter. We are still in the \"getting the kids to adjust\" stage; so basically we have weekend sleepovers and play dates kind of thing but live separately. I have full custody of my kids; he has his daughter every other weekend.   For Christmas we decided to spend the entire week together. All of the kids and us in my family cabin. Lots of privacy. I spoke to my BFs daughters mom personally and asked to have her for that week; she said yes. I even invited her, so she was here for her daughter to open presents on Christmas.   Flash forward to the days following Christmas.. we are due to leave my cabin tomorrow. My BF has not gotten off his ass once to interact with his daughter. She has been so far crammed up my ass that I cant even move without her bumping into me. I'm used to this, obviously, because I have babies of my own. I also love this little girl and want to pinch her chubby cheeks 24/7 but I'm getting irritated at this point. He has not helped her put together her gifts, has not played with her, has not baked with her (I had all the kids baking cookies), nothing. I have been doing everything.   So, last night I was making the kids cocoa and I said \"Hey, want to come get Sarah her cocoa?\" He said \"You're right there. Cant you just do it?\" So, i sucked it up and made her the cocoa, with extra marshmallows (because I was being petty and knew he didnt want her having much sweets before bed). He glared at me. I smirked in return. Childish. Later that night after the kids were in bed I said to him \"You really need to get off your ass and do something with your kid. You're treating me like I'm the parent here. This was supposed to be a family thing and so far, it's me and the kids only, while you sit on your ass and play with your new toys. I'm fed up.\" Somehow this got misconstrued into him thinking that I dont want his child around and immediately said \"You're a fucking asshole. I would never have sparked this relationship if I knew you would find a way to hold my kid against me.\"   Now I'm curious if what I said could even be taken that way.\n",
      "Last week I had to return a rental car at a small regional airport after a long drive from a major airport.  I found a marked spot in the Avis lot, and gathered my bags and started walking towards the terminal to hand over my keys and check out.  As I was waking towards the rental office, dragging my luggage, I was approached by a twenty-something guy in a dirty tshirt, shorts, untied sneakers, yelling into a cellphone as he walked toward me.  He comes over to me and says “she says to give me the keys” (still holding his cellphone up to his ear… so I wasn’t sure if he was even talking to me)  I said “who are you?”  He gets annoyed and says “SHE SAYS IM SUPPOSED TO TAKE THE KEYS”  I said “do you work for Avis?”  He is starting to get pissed and says “YES I WORK FOR AVIS, GIVE ME THE KEYS”  I said “where’s your name tag? You don’t have an Avis hat or shirt or anything? How do I know you work for Avis? I think I’ll just go into the terminal to the Avis desk and return them myself, but thanks.”  Now he’s super pissed. He yells “BUT SHE SAID TO GIVE ME THE KEYS”  I said, “listen buddy, I have no idea who you are, you’re not wearing any sort of Avis ID, like a shirt or ball cap or anything, I’m not giving you the keys, we can walk into the desk together and I’ll turn in the keys”  He yells “I KNOW WHY YOU WONT GIVE ME THE KEYS, ITS OBVIOUS” (he is black I’m white, so he’s implying I’m being racist for not giving him the keys)   I am now starting to get pissed, and I said “listen buddy, the only reason I’m not giving you the keys is because I have no idea who you are, you are not identified as working for Avis, and I wouldn’t give the keys to anybody in this situation, it has nothing to do with anything other than the fact that you have no identification that you work for Avis”  He is pretty much yelling now “OK, THATS HOW YOURE GONNA PLAY THIS? I SEE WHATS UP, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHY YOU WONT GIVE ME THE KEYS. ITS OBVIOUS”  So we walk into the terminal to the Avis counter, where the lady behind the counter in an Avis shirt gets pissed at me for not giving the guy the keys. I give the keys to her, she gives them to him, and he huffs off.  Apparently he does work for Avis, and I am the asshole for not giving him the keys.  TL/DR: approached by random guy in parking lot when returning a rental car, won’t give him the keys because he has no ID that he works for Avis, he gets pissed and implies I’m racist. Turns out he does work for Avis and the lady at the Avis desk gets pissed at me for not having given him the keys.\n",
      "hey there :) I  just had an argument with my mom, a repeating one. I was supposed to visit my mom today to do her hair. I colour it every 4 to 6 weeks, but  can only do so when I'm not at work. Now, I'm a nurse and just can't come whenever she wants, which she does not seem to grasp even though  I'm employed at the same hospital for 15 years now. This morning, she asked me when I would swing by and I said between 2 and 3 pm. I mean, I  have two dogs and a house of my own, I need to attend to as well. She was not satisfied with the answer, it was a bit too late for her liking  because she wanted to go to the bank as well. I have to admit I totally forgot about the bank, but instead of offering a time of her own, or listening to me she began ranting and I ended a call. I still intended to get there just a bit earlier, when she called and said, that I don't need to come today. I was actually just getting ready when she told me.  OK fine by me. Now I called and wanted to talk about when we should meet up tomorrow and again she berated me. Saying that I am a failure,  that I never do anything for her, which is obviously not true. Thing is,  she has been to the bank and is thinking about applying the hair colour herself now, just because she is impatient. I tried to reason with her,  that I wanted to come, but again she would not listen. My mom is 70, I  call her every morning and every evening to check up on her and often enough a couple of times during the day as well. The rest of the family -  dad, grandparents, uncles, cousins- are already dead, it's just us two.  But in her mind, I have never time for her. She went so far to say,  that I have time enough to talk to my colleagues but never just come by to her house. Well, I talk to my colleagues  at   work,   would be strange if not, right? Doesn't she get that I have to work?  She thinks I'm super lazy and should pull my head out of my ass. Why? I  spent 8-10 h at work, clean my house, walk my dogs and do other stuff.  BTW she hates that I occasionally struggle with art or play a video game. Last time she said, I have the hobbies of a twelve-year-old.   Still, I simply cannot come by on a working day. And I wanted to come by today. After getting repeatedly called a failure, I ended the call again and turned my phone off. I'm confused. Am I the asshole? Am I such  a bad daughter? I'm 38 and still single without kids, partly because I  spend most of my spare time with her, take her to concerts and shopping and stuff instead of meeting people my own age. And if I want to go out on my own that ends in arguments as well, because I'd rather spend time with other people than with her. I'm at a loss here and start to think I  really am the asshole. Well... tomorrow I'll swing by and do her hair if she hasn't done it yet and bring her some stuff she has forgotten at my place and probably get berated some more.\n",
      "At the beginning of the year my friends kept asking and telling me to make a Minecraft server. After a week and a half of reading up how to make a Minecraft server and watching YouTube videos over it I made a server out of my old gaming pc. I spent extra money to buy spare parts for my server in case something happened such as ram and a graphics cards dying out of the blue. I had the usual problems with people joining acting like they was nice players only to grieve the server and so on as well as the small handful of people who had backdoored the server. The greeters trolls and people who had gotten on the server had been up banned and added to the banned list but a few months after I noticed hardly anyone was playing. In September I shut the server down do to it barely being used do to power draw. Now since the cave and cliffs update is being talked about only 1 person has asked me to turn the server back on. I made it clear if I was to turn my server back on I'd need a list of at least 20 people who would be on it most of the time. I am still waiting on the list as of the time of this post. AITA for shutting my server down\n",
      "This happened a few years ago and a friend recently told me I was an asshole for doing it so I wanted to check on here.   Me and a friend had been at the mall and we didnt have a ride, so we decided to go home in a cab. We asked the taxi driver how much it would cost to go to our neighborhood and he told us it would be about 15 dollars (there aren't set rates where I live). We agreed and my friend decided to pay for it.   Our neighborhood is pretty big and my friend lives in the part closest to the mall so we dropped him off first. He gave me the money for the cab and we set off to my house.  On the way I could tell the can driver was unhappy that my house was so deep into the neighborhood so I told him to pull over a couple blocks before my house and decided to walk the rest of the way. I handed the cab driver the money but he started demanding more. I told him I had no more cash on me and he refused to let me leave. So I told him I'd go into my house and get the extra money. I think he must've thought the house we had pulled over in front of was mine. I left him with the money I had and just ditched the cab.  At first I thought the cab driver must have been the asshole, but thinking back I don't think we told him how far into the neighborhood we wanted to go, and I do live in a less populated section so most people wouldn't expect him to go so far.  AITA?\n",
      "( I traveled back their for Christmas) .My parents are very very very political people. All of their friends are also very political( they all support the same party, so it got annoying ). When I was 22 I graduate from college and moved to NY to become a IB.( I haven been home in 5 years. That’s why I put this)  I thought it was going to be a relaxing vacation. At dinner they asked how I liked my “corrupt” job. I told them it was good . They asked what I did for fun and I said not much. Between being a landlord and investment banker I was working 14 hours a day and 8 on the weekends.They than called me some horrible things for being a landlord. Even though that bothered me I let it slide. But the whole time they talked politics. Like the whole 3 hours. I tried to change the subject but they wouldn’t listen. I asked if we could stop talking politics,they  said no.   Once they left I thought it was over. Well I was wrong, my parents were talking about it for the next 2 hours. I was done. I told them I wasn’t going to be staying there tonight or every again. My mom started crying but I didn’t feel empathy because they didn’t stop their friends from calling me horrible names.   So I might be the asshole for saying something no parent wants to hear.\n",
      "I read a story today about food delivery and was reminded of something that happened to me and my buddy several years ago. This is a bit long, I hope it's worth the read.  Many years ago, before mask mandates and other things happened, my buddy and I were chilling when we decided to order pizza from a place called Pizza Pizza. After you place your order online, you get a timer on the screen and the pizza is free if it shows up after that. I only ever saw the timer hit 0 once before.  Now, one thing to keep in mind is that this pizza place was down the street from my place, literally a ten minute walk in a straight line would put you at their door, I was even on the same side of the street. So we make our order sometime in the early afternoon and get the timer for something like 30 or 45 minutes, I don't remember exactly. The timer starts, I put the tab on my second screen so we always see it, and go back to gaming.  Time passed, and the timer was down to less than 5 minutes. We're waiting, and waiting, and then finally the timer hits 0. We're like, \"sweet, free pizza!\" We keep waiting for about 5 minutes, then I get a call on my phone. It's the driver, he says he can't find the place and is lost. Once he described the area he's in, I tell him that he's on the wrong side of the street and that he also went too far. Almost 10 minutes later, the guy shows up.  I answer the door, say hi, the usual thing, until it comes to the bill. He passes me the debit machine, and I basically tell him \"hey dude, the timer says it's free now. We don't have to pay.\" Guy fires back, saying he was only late because he got lost and that I still need to pay. Keep in mind that he only called me saying he was lost several minutes after the timer hit 0.  We go back and forth, him insisiting I pay and me insisting it's free. My buddy finally convinces me to just pay so that we can eat, but before the guy leaves I tell him that I'll be calling the HQ number about this. He insists I shouldn't do that, talking over me. He walked out the door saying \"thank you for not calling HQ.\"  Obviously I called their HQ anyway and when I explained the situation they gave me store credit. My buddy thought that I should have just paid and let it go rather than make a fuss though. The real kicker to this, is that the delivery driver later called me on my phone again to thank me for calling their HQ and getting him in trouble.  This guy kept my personal phone number and called me to make a snarky remark. I answered \"you're welcome\" and hung up.  Am I the asshole?\n",
      "So some background...this is my boyfriend’s friend from an old job that I recently became good friends with and she just moved in with us and some other roommates. One day her car broke down and I said I’d give her rides, thinking she would get it fixed within a week or two (she’s a server and makes good money, I know because she’s always spending money on herself, no reason she can’t afford t get it fixed). It’s been 3 months now that I have been consistently giving her rides to the point where she doesn’t even ask anymore just assumes I’m driving her then gets irritated with me when I can’t drive her, saying she has no other option blah blah trying to make me feel bad. She doesn’t ever give me gas money, just buys me stuff like food or drinks once in a while, which I even end up paying her back for sometimes.   So she was going out of state to visit family and asked me to pick her up from the airport that’s about 1.5-2 hours away from our house. She asked me like 2 weeks in advance, so I didn’t think I had plans. So then maybe about a week before the trip my grandma had asked if me and my bf could come visit her, she needed his help with some things. After talking about the best day for both us, we decided on a day and my bf asked for the day off work so we could go, which is not the easiest thing for him to do. Well my dumb forgetful self said yes even though it was the day I was supposed to pick up my friend, and it had totally slipped my mind. She asks me the night before if I can still pick her up, and I profusely apologized and said I couldn’t because I was going to my grandmas which is 40 min away in the same direction as the airport so I didn’t want to backtrack and spend half of my day off driving. She said she had no one else and that it’s too late for her to try and find someone, so I offered to buy her a ticket for the airbus that would take her back home, which is about $40. She replies “I’ll just do it it’s fine”. Obviously it wasn’t fine because then she posted on Facebook saying how her plans got screwed and needed someone to pick her up from the airport.  Anyway she’s getting home tomorrow and I’m prepared for the cold shoulder cause I messed up,but I feel like it’s kind of misplaced/undeserved, even wondering if she really cares about my feelings as her friend. AITA?\n",
      "i play piano. recently my parents have been telling me that i didn't practice well enough and that I only practice for 5 minutes each day.  i know that i practice well over 5 minutes and have already told them multiple times that I do not like them saying this but they just keep on going. today i found myself in a argument about this and ended up calling them a b***h and flipping the bird  i feel that i may be the asshole since they only want me to practice more so that I can get ready for a concert. on the other hand, i feel that they are disregarding the time i put into my practice.\n",
      "this is a confusing one sorry  i 20 f am dating my sister Lucy's ( 28 f ) boyfriend (josh 29 m) of 3 ish years that she broke up with. i know there's a whole thing surrounding dating a siblings ex but please hear me out.  We live in relatively small village, it's a 10 mile drive to the nearest town, and i haven't got my drivers licence yet because I've been too busy with work and classes. Lucy and Josh started dating around late 2016 and got engaged in 2018.  Then in early 2019 Lucy found out she can't have children due to a problem with her ovaries. I don't know exactly what went on but after the infertility diagnosis Lucy became very depressed, she went on antidepressant medicine and started therapy.  A few weeks after starting therapy she and Josh broke up, mutually apparantly. Josh lives just down the road from us so i see him out and about on the farm quite often.  It just kind of happened naturally, we grew closer together and went on some dates, but then i fell unexpectedly pregnant but i kept it secret from Lucy because she is still very down and depressed.  In my opinion Josh can't just never move on, and someone shouldn't be forever off limits because your sibling briefly dated them.  So i decided after 2 months that it was time to tell Lucy, soon I'll start to show and I'm planning on moving in with josh before the baby arrives but shit . hit. the. fan.  She's living back at home now and has been since the break up, and she looks awful, she mostly slouches around in her pjs, i sat her down and said i have some news. i told her i was with josh and that im expecting,  i told her it would mean the world to be if she would be god mother to the baby and asked if she would like to plan the shower for me as i know she absolutely thrives on parties.   She didn't even react, just asked me to leave I made the point that it's our parents house. I know on paper this sounds bad, it really dose but i should be allowed to live my life and so should Josh.  The baby was unplanned and something we couldn't have forseen, i know that is probably a bit of salt in the wound but i couldn't have helped a complete supprise. i love my sister and want to see her happy but she text me this morning saying this  : lucy : Thanks for letting me know your dating josh, oh and that your pregnant with his child, congratulations you achieved what i could not, i am in such a bad place and you will never understand, josh and i agreed i needed time and medication and then we would try again but i guess he never told you that did he. as for your baby shower all i can say is well done,  you always were good at telling jokes. i hope you rot in hell you evil bitch.  I confronted josh about this and he admitted it was true but that once we started dating that he fell in love with me, they have been apart for 6 months now and it is getting tiring i have a baby on the way and i desperately need her support AITA\n",
      "Throwaway because reasons. My boyfriend (22M) and I (23F) are currently long distance while he finishes school. We've been together for almost 3 years now, but keep having the same argument over and over. Some backstory: I work 2 jobs; an office job in the morning M-F and I waitress until 10 or 11 at night twice a week. Needless to say, it's important that I get enough sleep before those days that I work double shifts. Anyways, yesterday on my lunch break at my day job, my boyfriend told me there was something he wanted to talk to me about (not related to our relationship), but wasn't quite emotionally ready yet. The day went on and we didn't speak very much as he's studying for finals. I spent most of my day after work watching Netflix as it was my day off, and I work today. When I called him at around 10:30 pm to say goodnight and rest, he said he was ready to talk then. I told him I was going to bed now and it was going to have to wait, and he got very upset with me, saying this is not the first time I've brushed him off. I told him he should stop bringing up serious conversations on the nights when I need to get a lot of sleep. We both still think the other is the asshole here, so let me ask you Reddit... AITA?  EDIT: This is not the first time this has happened, and I consistently try to tell him to have better timing with serious conversations. He had all afternoon to talk to me but chose right before I slept, which he has done so many times in the past as well.\n",
      "I (17F) work as a barista at a “coffee shop,” particularly the one America runs on. Since the pandemic, school has been pretty much over for me so I’ve been working full time hours, only working morning shifts (4 AM, by myself at the front but there are two bakers in the back) so I’m always pretty dead until about two hours into my shift. It’s also worth mentioning that my workplace is located more on the rough side of town, well known for robberies (our store got robbed four times last year and once this past March) and our regular customers know this.  Less than half an hour into my shift, I prepared a mobile to-go order for one of our regular customers. He pulled up to the front in his car 5 minutes later and went in the store, leaving his car on and his driver door wide open. I said good morning and immediately stared off into space after he said hi back. I then hear a car speed away and just like that, the car was gone. The customer starts yelling, first towards the direction of where his car was, then at me. He asked why didn’t I warn him and I responded with I don’t know, I didn’t see it happen. He then told me I should’ve been paying attention to paying customers and that he’d call corporate to report me for not doing my job. He even said that he would sue the company if his car wasn’t found.  The customer spent the next half hour making calls, occasionally calling me a “stupid bitch” to whoever he was on the phone with. My manager came soon after and I told him about the incident. Manager told me to go home because I was nearly about to cry because the customer made it seem like it was my fault the car got stolen.  Yeah, I should’ve been paying attention and plus honestly, I was really tired. I feel partially at fault for this and my friends who I told thought I was too, but they said it wasn’t entirely my fault.   Was I the AH for not paying attention, causing a customer’s car to get stolen?  EDIT: My last opening shift is this Tuesday and my manager is giving me two weeks off to collect myself because I feel guilty and don’t want to show my face at work. Thank you guys for telling me your perspective. While I might not be at fault, I personally still feel like I’m somewhat responsible.\n",
      "First of all this is my first-ever story that I post on reddit. Second of all english is my second language so sorry for the typos, also im on phone so sorry for the format.  On to the story   A few months ago I (16M) subscribed to a well known porn site (not my proudest moment btw). I payed with my debit card. Well my mother stomped into my room and asked why I subscribed to the site. I was taken back, I didnt know where she got that from, so I asked how she knew. She said that she saw it on my e-mail account (I didnt had an account before so I had to create one and I gave them my e-mail for that). I said that it was not her bussines. She started yelling to me about I souldnt have done that, and basically told me that I quote \"You sould not have secrets infront of me\" and \"I forbid you to use it\". I told her that what she did invade my privacy. She scoffed and told my dad, who was a bit sad about it but understood the situation. Needless to say my mom didnt liked that so she started screaming once more. I had enough and said to her that if I want to watch dongs on the internet, then I will watch dongs on the internet. She got upset and didnt spoke to me for a week. After that I deleted my e-mail from every possible device that she might got the info from (tablet, family computer etc.), and changed my password. Last week she aproched me asking why she cant check into my e-mail account I told her that I changed the password and she just stared at me like I just killed her whole family and her cute cat infront of her eyes. She didnt screamedat me, she was just sad, I asked her why it was so important to her to watch my e-mails. She said that she doesnt like me to have secrets infront of her. To be honest I get where she is comming from, she was allways kind and honest to me, allways taught me that the best way is to be honest and tell the truth. She isnt a raging entitled parent , she is just owerprotective. That being said I kinda regret what I did, but I still think Im in the right here.  So tell me Reddit, AITA?\n",
      "My gf likes to video call but also watches something on the side. It's starting to get on my nerves, like I would be telling her something, then it's silence on the other end. I then ask if the call froze and she said \"oh I wasn't really paying attention, sorry can you repeat?\" I then said \"if you want to watch something and I'm distracting you then call when you're free\" to which she responded \"no, no I'll pay attention, it won't happen again, I'm sorry\".  Since then she's done it quite a few times but I guess last night was my breaking point. I even said her name 3 times. If I'm being ignored, I have better things to do so I hung up. After about 5 minutes she called me back asking why I hung up. I repeated her promise, the fact that she broke it and if she's just going to ignore me then I'd rather just text so I can do something else. She called me an AH for hanging that promise over her head and that she's trying.  So AITA for hanging up?\n",
      "So My Wife and I were attending a concert in another state. My Brother in Law (BIL) was also attending the same concert with his buddies. BIL purchased the tickets for him and his two buddies with the thought they’d pay him back. One of BIL’s buddies was going to drive all three of them to the concert. Day before the concert my BIL calls my wife and says his buddy the driver had to cancel last minute because he had to go to work. My BIL now wanted me to give him a ride to the concert. I agreed. Suddenly my BIL says his buddy whom I’ve never met needs a ride too. My  Wife asked my BIL if his other buddy would drive be willing to drive , BIL said he didn’t want to put him off. BIL and his friends like to drink when they go out. Knowing they might be drunk and the fact I don’t know this other guy I didn’t feel comfortable having them drive in my car. My MIL said what if they promised to not drink and behave. Problem is my BIL has told my MIL he doesn’t drink in the past and would proceed to post photos of him and his buddies getting hammered at a bar. I told BIL I would give him a ride still and his buddy would need to find another way there. BIL refused my offer and said he didn’t want his buddy traveling alone. I offered to help BIL by exploring other options to get to the concert including bus, train and Uber. BIL refused these alternate routes and proceeded to tell my I ruined his night and cost him money. He attempted to sell the tickets online and couldn’t find a buyer. He wound up eating the cost of all 3 tickets. My in-laws are also mad that I refused to give BIL’s friend a ride. Am I the asshole for refusing to give a ride to someone whom I don’t know?\n",
      "My girlfriend is backing out of attending my friend's wedding because she needs to bring her car to the mechanic.  For context, my girlfriend and I have been dating for over 8 years and we've always been long-distance for various reasons. Currently, I live in Portland, Oregon and she's in Phoenix, Arizona. We don't get to see each other often due to the distance.  At the end of the month, a close friend of mine is having and wedding and I'm part of the wedding party. We've known about this wedding for well over a year now and I've told my girlfriend many times that it is very important to me we both go to the wedding. She's not very close with my friend at all but I still believe it's important she goes because she's my girlfriend.  Over a month ago, my girlfriend got into a car accident and received some minor damage to her car. It's still drivable but it needs to be fixed. She's going to be moving up to Portland soon and she'll need the car repaired to do so.  I have already booked and paid for a plane ticket for her to come up. She has purchased her clothing for the wedding.  With the wedding now two weeks away, she told me she cannot come and I should refund the plane ticket. She apparently scheduled an appointment with a mechanic to get her car fixed and it falls within the travel days. I was informed she had this scheduled for a month now. She says she was forced to choose that date by the insurance company and that the mechanic won't have a slot open for another month if she doesn't come in that day. Not getting the car fixed could delay her moving and she doesn't want to risk that.  I got very upset and told her not attending the wedding is completely unacceptable and that she has to find a way to make it to the wedding. She said she doesn't care about my friend but she knows it's important to me but I still have to accept it is out of her control.  For additional context, we missed another friend's wedding back in July of this year. My girlfriend's dog got incredibly sick close to the wedding and it looked like the dog was going to die. I spoke with my friend and didn't go to the wedding so we could both be with the dog in the final days. Luckily, the dog made a full recovery, but we still missed the wedding. At the time, my girlfriend promised we will absolutely make it to the next wedding, knowing this one was coming up.  Now it's the time of the wedding and she's backing out. I got into a screaming match with her because I felt this was unfair and something she could have avoided. She knew the wedding was coming, knew the date of the wedding, and knew the importance of it to me. She scheduled that repair knowing when it would land and didn't tell me about it until it was too late.  She's saying I'm being unreasonable and I need to accept this is completely out of her control and there is nothing she can do to go. I told her she has to find a way to go.  AITA for being so mad at her and still trying to force her to go to the wedding?  EDIT: I think an important bit of info is it's not confirmed if she's moving yet. She's applied for her own apartment but hasn't heard back from the building yet. It seems likely but there are no moving dates, no hard deadlines, and no confirmations.  EDIT 2: For clarification, we're both friends with the bride and have known her for years. I'm just much, much closer with the bride than my girlfriend is. Because of distance, my girlfriend never see's her and considers her more of an acquaintance. But they do know each other. It's not that I was invited and I'm bringing my girlfriend. We were both invited to this wedding.\n",
      "Background:   Been with my boyfriend for years. Over the course of those years, I have gone from being an independent woman to being physically disabled to the point where my boyfriend often helps me do things, such as shower. In an ideal world, this would not be the situation but it is.   My boyfriend has a habit where he pees in the shower  every time  he takes a shower. Sometimes he tries to aim for the wall so it doesn't hit me, but very often it does mean he pees  on me  (both indirectly and directly).   I do not like this.   I did not notice at first that he would do this except a couple of times where he DID pee directly on me. I forgave him the first few times because he said it was just an accident/reflexive from the temperature and that he totally didn't mean to pee on me. These times where I forgave him, he also apologized immediately even before I noticed what was happening.  However I have noticed that he's just stopped apologizing for it and I have caught him many times just peeing in the shower while I am there, or him peeing directly on me and hoping I don't notice because of the shower water, etc. He admitted to me then that he pees  every time  he's in the shower, no matter what.  I've asked him numerous times to hold it, or to go before he hops in the shower with me. He says this is because the hot water \"hits his bladder\" and makes him pee. Also he says that since he's a man and doesn't just sit on the toilet every time he goes to the bathroom, he can't just MAKE himself pee before he gets in the shower unless he felt like he had to pee before (he doesn't even pretend to try though even when I ask him immediately at that moment before we shower to go use the bathroom beforehand). He also says that its saving the environment and that I shouldn't care because \"pee is sterile\" and I should be grateful since he's helping me more than most other boyfriends would.  To me, I don't care if he pees in the shower when he's by himself. I know I have done that when I could. However peeing when there is someone else there and peeing ON them feels extremely disrespectful. I know it isn't hurting me but it does feel rather rude, and I don't necessarily always have the option to just shower by myself anymore or time to argue with him before we hop into the shower.  It makes me upset, but at the same time he acts like such a mopey victim when I get mad at him for peeing on me that sometimes I think maybe I shouldn't care so much since it isn't physically hurting me.\n",
      "I'm a member of several freecycling groups on Facebook, and I had put up a mattress to give away. One guy kept commenting with questions and I answered them all, then he said he was still trying to confirm transport. I responded that I would prefer pickup by Wednesday. He didn't reply for two hours, in the meantime other people were PMing/commenting to me as well, and one didn't have any questions, just said he could get it immediately so I agreed. I put a generic \"Reserved\" comment on the post, not on first guy's thread. He eventually came back asking for my exact address and I said sorry someone else had confirmed pickup already, and I closed the post.  Now the first guy is blowing up my inbox that he was handling his baby and how was he to know that someone else was queuing for it. I blocked him and deleted the post, but I do feel both kinda guilty and at the same time needlessly attacked by someone who was going to get something for free, in a group where there were 3 other similar items that I saw listed. I do live in a country where there is high community trust and giving your word is important, but neither of us absolutely confirmed so it wasn't like I marked it reserved for him and going back on my word. AITA?\n",
      "I (19M) was in a lecture at my uni, it was a relatively small class (not many ppl, small room).  We got a bit side tracked and she was going thru my bag, she found edibles and got extremely excited.  I told her to shush and we'd take some later on. She took one out of the package and pretended to eat it.  I got dead serious and said don't eat it, there was 25mg of THC inside the edibles, I repeatedly warned her not to eat it. I told her they were really strong, and just to wait until we got back home. I practically begged her not to, and she popped it in her mouth and said \"edibles aint SHIT\"  half an hour later, she is stoned af, talking louder than she should, smacking her lips, and being a general nuisance.  People were staring at us, all the while, I'm just looking straight ahead pretending not to know her.  She then gets really paranoid and starts freaking out saying \"My heart is beating too fast\", \"I cant move\", \"help me\". they were genuine cries for help. She was legitimately freaking out.  People were looking at us and getting really annoyed, so I got up and moved to a different seat until our 3 hour lecture was over.  I walked up to her after class and she was crying, she told me she was shocked that I \"abandoned\" her.  I literally told her not to take it and she did. WTF did she expect?   Everyone she tells this story to is saying I'm a massive asshole. Even after I explain the whole story, people say things like \"When someone is drunk or high, you never leave their side. You're a shitty friend and a shitty person\", \"how would you feel if that was you in that exact situation\", \"It's your stuff, you should have taken care of her\", or \"She misjudged how strong it was, you should have been there for her\"  I don't agree, I think she deserved what happened to her as a matter of fact. AITA?\n",
      "My(36F) son (16) is nonsexually and has more friends that are girls then boys, his one friend started her monthly while in school, my son being the boy he is told her and he gave her his hoodie to wear until her parent could bring clothes. Her parent was unable to bring clothes so he called me to get her what she needed, when I dropped off the clothes and supplies he came to get them and the receptionist asked him how he planned to give them to her if she was in the bathroom he stated \"well if a boy identified as a girl they can use the girls bathroom, so for the next 15 minutes I'm a girl,\" I won't lie I laughed, I told him he shouldn't be rude to people. The receptionist told him he needed to find another girl to take them to her and he said no because the others girls were teasing her. He went into the girls bathroom and gave her the supplies under the door and came back out, the receptionist wrote him up for \"inappropriate behavior with female classmates\" he ripped it up and told the receptionist that he hopes her daughter need help from someone and they follow the \"rules.\"   Am I the asshole for not punishing my son for helping a fellow classmate and for not allowing the school to punish him?\n",
      "I'll try to keep it as short as I possibly can.. (23F) My mom abused/neglected me alot as a kid and made sure I wasn't calling family to talk to them about anything at home. Many horrible things have happened, so much so that this would just turn into a novel. When I turned 18, she instantly threw me out (after moving us cross country 2 weeks prior) and I hadn't really spoken to her until last Christmas. She doesn't seem to feel like she has done anything wrong, speaks horribly about the rest of my family, has criticized my fiancé, and now that I am not speaking to her again, has sent me hate letters in the mail because I won't answer her on the phone.  She claims that I'm a rude person who doesn't care about anyone else, an emotional drain, and that she's happy even without me. I'm pretty upset about it because she is so toxic and I've tried my best to be the bigger person and stay quiet. Am I the asshole for not wanting to have anything to do with her?  TLDR: My mom is toxic and narcissistic, I don't want to speak with her,  AITA?\n",
      "About three weeks ago, I got a haircut from a stylist that comes to your house to do your hair. His Instagram was full of really great short haircuts, which is what I wanted to get  The home service meant that it was pretty pricy But I'd gotten some pretty disastrous haircuts before, so I didn't mind paying extra to get a nice cut. So the day comes, and he sets up and asks me what I have in mind. I show him a couple of Pinterest images of what I was going for. It was basically a pixie bob. He picks one of the reference images and decides to start. It all goes well, and he asks me if I'd like a sneak peek before he dries it. I say sure and he hands me the mirror. It looks awful. My hair looks shorn and messy. I guess he reads into the fact that I'm not saying anything He says he will be doing some more touches to fix it up. Towards the end, after he blow dries it and styles it with some hairspray, it looks ok. Not really what I wanted, but not terrible. Because I don't want to seem rude, I say it actually looks quite good. Anyhow, the next day I wash out my hair, and dry it. And then realize that my haircut is uneven, on top of being messy and choppy. On one side, it's longer, and looks decent. It has that long to short thing going on. On the other side though, it's shorter and kind of boxy.  I really wasn't going for the asymmetrical look, and it didn't look right at all. I felt awful. Every time I looked in the mirror I wanted to cry. About three days after the haircut, I was still feeling very down. It felt like I'd made a huge mistake . Then I thought maybe I should tell him that he'd messed up and give him feedback. It seemed like getting closure I guess? So I sent him a text, and said it looked good,  except that the shorter side looked pretty strange. he told me that if I was unhappy with the style he would give me the money back and I could get it cut elsewhere. Tone doesn't translate well on text, but he seemed upset. So i said that it wasn't necessary, I just wanted to give him feedback, and that I was sorry if I was rude . I honestly wasn't gunning for a refund considering that he'd come all the way to my house, and put so much time into cutting my hair. Then he said it was fine , but that if I felt it wasn't cut right, then he wanted to give me a refund. He insisted a bit, so I agreed and he transferred the money back. I decided to just forget the whole thing, wait for my hair to grow out, and just pin it back till then. Fast forward to now though , my hair actually looks good. I don't know if it growing a bit helped, or if I got used to it, but it genuinely looks a lot better. And now I feel really guilty for having taken the money back. Did I jump the gun and judge the haircut too quickly? I feel like I should message him and ask him if I can make the payment again. What do you all think?\n",
      "I told my roommates before we even started touring places together that I wanted an Australian Shepherd puppy.One of my roommates has a cat, and the other has two dogs.So, when we moved in, I waited 3 months before bringing up the puppy again.   I found a breeder and was interested in a puppy; my roommates and I had a conversation about it.They said that they would prefer I got an adult dog.They also asked that I wait one month before getting a dog.I was a little upset about this, but ultimately I respected it.   2 months later (almost 1/2 into our lease) I told them I had found a 3 year old Australian Shepherd that was being rehomed as his previous owner was moving.I invited my roommates to come meet the dog, but one was going out of town and the other was working.So, I met the previous owner alone.She gave me the leash(I thought she was grabbing a toy or some water)but she got in her car and drove away.I work from home and was scheduled to work that night, so I had to bring the dog back with me.   The roommate that was out of town was concerned about her dogs— which I understood, and made sure they were never in the same room.The Aussie stayed in my room with me while I worked.I told my roommates that I would take him to my parents house for a week or 2, first thing in the morning(since I had to work).   At midnight, when I got off work, I took the dog to a friends house where we spent the night.In the morning, I took him to my parents house.The dog and I have been staying here for 2weeks, and we have to stay for at least 3more.I might have to start renting an air bnb or jump around friends homes with him because my dad is allergic.   The Aussie is the sweetest boy in the world.I’ve had him around cats, dogs, men, women and children.He does great with everyone.I also did a full vet checkup.He’s in perfect health and fully vaxed.I haven’t even heard him bark yet and he doesn’t pull on his harness(unless he sees a bunny). He isn’t an energetic dog, but he’ll play and swim when I participate with him.He’s been taught not to jump on furniture, and refuses to even jump into my car(I have to lift him).   Still, one of my roommates demands that he can’t move in until AFTER her birthday(3weeks away).She says it’s because her cat and the other roomies dogs haven’t been socialized together.We are halfway through our lease next week.If they were going to socialize their animals together, it would have happened by now.   My roommates think I’m rushing this and forcing them into something—which I can understand, but I wasn’t even planning this to happen yet myself! I told the old owner that I wanted to meet at least one more time, with my roommate and her dogs.But the Aussie was dumped on me.  I did all the things my roomies asked(I waited two more months instead of one, and he’s an adult, neutered dog).PLUS I’ve been jumping through hoops, moving my work equipment and the dog from place to place, to accommodate the new “after my birthday” rule.So, AITA??\n",
      "The title mostly says what the problem is, but I will give a short background of the situation at hand.  I am a freshman at college and just completed my first semester. It's been tough not only because of anxiety but also because I am living with my sister and brother-in-law. I chose this over a dorm because of my acute anxiety. Over the course of this first semester, they have been difficult to live with at times. They are often very short with me and use rude tones when talking to me. They blame me for not helping enough when doing the dishes or cleaning, even though I do more than my fair share. All that aside, my brother-in-law is really getting to me.  Example: I had just made dinner the other night and brother-in-law and I were relaxing playing Smash Bros. Now we usually have a trade-off where if someone makes dinner, then the other does the dishes and cleans. He ignored this of course. My sister was cleaning and he said to me, \"OP, I think [my sister] is doing the dishes all by herself.\" I responded by saying, \"Okay, brother-in-law, well I made dinner, so why don't you go help her?\" He didn't respond to this but he was definitely irked. Later that night my sister got involved and told me that it was rude of me to say such a thing to brother-in-law.  This happens a lot. Probably every week. He will be doing nothing like playing Battlefront II and tell me to go do the dishes after I just got back from a whole day of classes. Also, he's just straight-up mean to me sometimes. He will be super moody which just makes things worse. He's never this way with my sister though, so I'm wondering if it's just me or just how he acts to other people. Either way, I'm a grown adult who doesn't need to be told what to do from a guy who's not much older than me. I know my responsibilities and how I need to contribute to this apartment, so I don't think he needs to be my mom in this situation. I'm considering talking to him about it if it comes up again but I want to know if I'm in the wrong here? Do they have more of a controlling situation here? Everything is split equally though. Should I be more respectful? WIBTA if I told him how he's acting towards me?\n",
      "ESH Sorry this is a long story but I'll put a TLDR at the bottom:  &nbsp;  A few months back, my husband's grandmother passed away. She lived overseas, close by to where my husband and I live , so a lot of family from america flew in for the funeral. After the funeral service, I heard my mother in law talking to my husband, asking him if I would consider escorting their 13 year old daughter (his sister) back to america, since she cannot fly alone. The Mother was flying to another state back in the US, where her sister was suffering from cancer and not doing well (the father travels a lot).  &nbsp;  My husband said absolutely not. He did not like being separated with me for long periods of time, and I have anxiety and depression, and he did not want my condition to worse in unstable situations. He did not want me to be 'used' for whenever his parents needed something done. I spoke to my husband later, and said I would be honored and flattered to have his parents give me such a major task to do, and to help his mother out during these hard times. Her mother just passed away, and her sister was ill, I wanted to help however I could, I wasn't working at the time and didn't mind helping out. Eventually I convinced my husband and I packed my things to go with his sister. Before I left, my mother in law approached me and asked me to make my sister in law breakfast each morning, and dinner, give her medicine if she's sick, and take her to the doctor and after school activities. I agreed, she also warned me NOT to act like a parent, just a helpful adult. So I agreed to that as well.   &nbsp;  When I arrived in america, I got up at the crack of dawn and helped wake her up, and made my in law breakfast each morning (we ordered out for dinner). Her 18 yo brother lived at home, but due to his laziness, and the sister's illness (and I suppose age), neither of them cleaned up after themselves. So I did my best to clean the house each day, do their laundry, ect. On top of this: the family had rented out their home the previous year, and only started to slowly move back in, so the house was a WRECK of items everywhere. I spent a lot of time trying to clean the home as best as I could. &nbsp;  At some point, my depression catches up with me, and I begin to slow down in pacing. I was told when my mother in law would arrive, so I decided to pull myself together to clean the home as best as possible before she arrived.   &nbsp;  She arrives earlier than I expect and explodes.   &nbsp;  She begins to freak out the kitchen isn't clean, that my sister in law hasn't been eating sufficient dinners. That the place is a wreck. She screams she is too embarrassed to call cleaning people because the house is so messy. I apologise and say I was doing my best to keep up each day, but it was difficult when I didn't get any help.  &nbsp;  Mother in law rolls her eyes, and says, well of course a thirteen year old isn't going to clean up after herself, and an 18 year old isn't, but a 27 year old woman!? She tells me to my face she is concerned for our future family, how will I be able to keep up with it? How will I be able to manage it? I am stunned, after everything I did for her family...none of that counted.   &nbsp;  Eventually I tell her I am going to stay by my sisters and begin packing my things. For some reason, my mother in law believes I left, and she begins trash talking me to my father in law.   \"The house is a wreck, food she bought isn't being eaten, is she really the best person for their son? Is he really happy with her?\"    I come down stairs and have my husband on the phone, he calms his mother down, and after talking to her for awhile, she cries and apologizes to me. I tell her it's okay, and I apologize to her as well, that I only meant to help her (I figured with her mom passing and her sister being ill, it was a lot for her all at once).  The next day, staying at my sisters, I buy my mother in law a gift to make up for what happened. My mother in law says I didn't need to, but accepts it.   &nbsp;  Anyway, fast forward to now: I am extremely destroyed by everything I heard her say. I haven't been eating well, or exercising like I used to. I keep wondering if she's right. Maybe I'm not the best person for my husband, we love each other so much. But I wonder if I'm not good enough for him.  Despite my good intentions, good intentions aren't good enough: it's what you are actually capable of doing, and I don't think I am capable.  Am I the asshole for taking on something I thought I could, but couldn't handle?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   TLDR : Escorted my sister in law back to America, was in charge of taking care of her, I did, and also their son, neither of them helped clean or do laundry, so it was on me to do it. I couldn't keep up and my depression made it harder, mother comes home and is pissed and tells me I'm not good enough to hold a family together and may not be good enough for her son.  Am I the asshole for taking on something I thought I could, but couldn't handle?\n",
      "So the story goes like that im 14 yo my parents divorced about 1 year ago. I live with my dad. Do it started about 4 years ago when my mother started drinking. At the start it was about 1 can a day but Turned to 7 or more. Sometimes she was so drunk she did not go to the toilet and did it under herself. She never cared about me . .  When she invited me to dinners i always came , my thinking was that she is still a family and somethings like that.  I dont want to create any drama. My dad says it is my decision. So if i said i did not want to go out with her i woud be an asshole? (Enaglish is not my first language so sorry for bad formating and any grammar mistakes)\n",
      "Inherited a house from my great aunt (she's been in hospice care for some time). My former SIL who is divorcing my brother lived there for a couple months.  I dislike her for her personality. We come from different worlds and I find her to be entitled and rude. The disagreements are mainly political. I was raised to believe in hard work paying off, she (despite being raised in a middle-income household and going to college) believes the world slighted her and owes her. To best describe her in a succinct way, she's the type of person to post on landlordhate subreddits, unironically follow antiwork or say that a certain president owes her to forgive her student debt. Prob worth mentioning that I generally vote for the D party, before some folks get the wrong idea.  Here's the 'me being the asshole part'. I gave her a 2 months warning while the estate affairs were being settled that I will be moving in and she needs to find another accommodation. She doesn't work and this means she will be homeless  and  will need to find a job during a difficult time.  I am also decently well off and don't need the house. It will merely help me save faster/live a much more comfortable lifestyle.  Last week the 2 months have ran out. I didn't bother with a sheriff eviction, instead I had a removal company come while she was at a family gathering to pack all her stuff. I paid for a month of storage, and changed all locks.  The fallout has been a complete shitshow. I know most of her immediate family and they've been furious (leaving this shit out because it will be an essay but ask if needed). I maintain it's because they are worried she'll leech off of them next, they claim it's because she's pregnant (no idea if true) and it's Christmas.  AITA?  Edit: I didn't want to put this in so that people judge me for the above-described conflict and not SIL's court record. But, SIL has problems with the law (not paying back rent after a legal eviction), so she has no intention of showing up in court. Appreciate the warnings/concerns in comments though.\n",
      "TLDR: I'm a young guy and had a heart attack and decided to not tell my mom until after I got out of the hospital a few days later after my pacemaker surgery. I did it so she wouldn't drop everything and spend money to see me.  So, had a heart attack at 24 (due to heart condition, I'm otherwise healthy) while grating parmesan for dinner on May the 4th last year (and the force was with me). That Friday I was hospitalized and in recovery I decided to wait until after I was being discharged to call my mother (lives a few states away) and let her know what happened and that I was okay. I have a few reasons that I didn't:    She's been paycheck to paycheck for a while and the time off/lost job and cost to drive or fly might break her.    she's very emotionally swingy and I didn't trust her to not come up here, or drive safely when she does.    she would insist on spending every moment with me. And she's a little bit if a smoother.    she would stay in the room with me and painkillers make me super grouchy. Her snoring is a trigger for my irrational meanness.    until I was resuscitated I never had a chance to notify her, and I learned I would be fine and the pacemaker procedure was 99.9 safe anyway. So I thought it would be fine to be like \"so here's what happened I'm fine\" after the fact.    She was profoundly hurt by me waiting to tell her, and my father was uncomfortable but understood. He mostly knew what I was in for.  So R/AITA, AITA?\n",
      "IMO \"Ma'am\" is what you call a person you superficially respect that you don't know.  The old biddy you let pass you in line at the grocery store, \"Go on ahead Ma'am\".  The secretary receiving your paper work, \"Here you go Ma'am\"...Even then I feel this interaction is on its last leg, the Ma'am part can be left out completely.  I believe its actually MORE polite to learn the secretaries name, instead of the default woman you dont know getting called \"Ma'am\".  In general im not the biggest fan of people calling women \"Ma'am\", I think it usually comes off as very pretentious, insincere and fake.  If you use the label \"Ma'am\" and it doesn't come off that way, fantastic, wonderful, you are one of the few that can pull it off.  Well, we hired this guy at our company, seems like a nice enough fellow...He called me Ma'am, a couple of times over the first few days in passing.  He finally gets to my end of the business and we have a real chat and in no uncertain terms told him, \"My name is X, please do not call me Ma'am.\"...He starts blubbering, \"oh gee im sorry ma'am, I mean X, its just a habit, where I come from, you know.\" (Colorado? lol).  Im very understanding and nice about it and I know habits are hard to break.  This guy has been here THREE MONTHS NOW and every single time he addresses me he says \"Ma'am\", and let me tell you his just oozes with pretentiousness and I absolutely cringe every time the word slips from his lips.  Over reaction?  Maybe, sure....but its my reaction & I cannot help it.  What he can help though!?  Words that come out of his mouth.   In time i've grown less & less patient and now he comes in \"Here Ma'am\" and I scowl at him and say \"My name is X\"...It really crosses me as lazy, like he can't be bothered to remember my name.  Then he always laughs about it, \"Oh yea yea haha right I forgot, ya the ma'am thing, sorry X, X, X\"...then five minutes later, \"Hey Ma'am\".  Im really growing to hate this guy.  My partners think im being an asshole to him, \"Oh just let him call you Ma'am, who cares, he thinks hes being polite.  Stop correcting him.\".  Yet its worth noting my male counter part is no longer getting called Mr or Boss by this guy but now uses his first name.  My disdain is starting to show and I can see a wide disparity in my attitude toward this guy versus the other employees & I dont like that feeling.\n",
      "I (30F) have been married to 'Alex' (32M) for a little over 4 years, but we've been together for around 8. Alex is one of those people who is always smiling, or at the very least neutral faced, he doesn't really frown or show anger often - because he sees it as an invitation for people to mock or aggravate you more.  He never pushed this onto me when we were dating, only occasionally making a small joke about how I should \"smile because you're never dressed without one\" (don't know where he got that, annie I guess?). Not to make out that he's one of those freaks that runs around looking mad or cheshire, like I said before, he just doesn't show negativity on his face ever - the only time I've seen his face drop was when his mother died a few years back. Even at home he just looks contented at most.  It's charming, really, though sometimes I worry about how much might be brewing under the surface. When we got married, he started pushing me to smile more than he had when we were dating, which is probably the time to say that im pretty deadfaced. I don't show much emotion, not purposefully or anything, my resting face is just kinda dull. I don't enjoy being told to smile, or look happy, never have even when I was a kid - but he didn't say anything about it enough for me to ever have a giant issue with it.  Recently I got some pretty bad personal news from my family, not anything I want to directly tell reddit, but it was extremely distressing for me. Alex comforted me for a while, before saying \"just smile\", I cant even remember the exact sentence, just that it tipped me off and I ended up blowing up at him. We didn't really argue, it was short, bitter and then we both just went into different rooms for the night.  We've been pretty tense since, not like silent treatment or anything - but there's just kind of a lingering in the air. I've asked my closest friend her opinion, and she says that I should've just let it be as he was trying to cheer me up - but at the same time I don't think telling someone in obvious distress to 'just smile' is appropriate anywhere. But im not sure if it's just my lingering anger/sadness mixed with the feelings I already had about him trying to make me smile that's making this such a big deal for me.  AITA?\n",
      "Standard on my phone so sorry for typos etc introduction  I'm in Australia and for those that aren't familiar we have Centrelink which I guess is like welfare. My ex works 5-6 days a week, getting $800+ which Centrelink does not know about and the pay gets put into his bank without having to pay tax as well, he's also claiming disability because of \"depression\" (although he does have depression he's able to obviously work, it's just an excuse to get out of job search, he's admitted that to me in the past) so gets another $700 a fortnight.   We have a son together, Centrelink believing he isn't working he has to pay bare minimal in child support ($22 a month) so we came to the agreement that that he pays an extra $100 a week which I don't think is that much of a stretch when you're getting $2300+ a fortnight and he gets our son every weekend for 2 nights, sometimes extra nights if asked for. Sometimes chooses not to have him at all for the weekend.   Since December last year in total he has given me $200. Considering I lived with him for 2 years I know what he is like so I know he doesn't plan on giving me any of the $1200 he owes me  so I'm thinking of notifying Centrelink and possibly the tax department of his fraud.   WIBTA if I did this as this is my son's father and he could get in a lot of trouble. But I don't feel it's fair that he can get away with not contributing to the support of our son when he earns more than double what I earn.\n",
      "(Sorry for my english) Here's the situation I (17F) have divorced parents and for august Im living with my dad and his gf (A) in her house. It's the first time I'm here. Recently A is accusing me of not participating in the house chores but I think its not true. I help as much as I can mostly with cleaning. I know I don't do as much as I do at my mom's but it's because they never told me anything (for example what they expected me to do).  Yesterday I was laying down in my bed when A came back from work and when my dad came back from work he said that A was complaining that I was doing nothing and being in my (wich is actually not mine) room. So I tried to speak to her, tell her that I helped with cooking and a bit of cleaning that day and I played with her 10yo who is special needs and cant be left alone. My dad said that I shouldn't talk to her like that and that Im mean and not helping.  I know I dont do as much as her daughters (19 and 17) and I do want to help but when I ask them how can I help they say \"no\". The reason why I'm laying down most of my free time is because I have scoliosis and standing and even sitting is painful for me. I think its also unfair that my brother and the daughter's boyfriend who do less than me aren't criticized like me.   I dont want to apologize but Im conflicted if Im being a AH or not.\n",
      "My employer does not pay well. Everyone at the firm is paid a good 30% less than they could make elsewhere. The firm makes up for it in some ways (such as casual attire, WFH flexibility, independence, stability, job security, etc). But, at the end of the day, they pay poorly and I have bills to pay and mouths to feed.  So, in October of last year, I gave my notice. But I tried to do the professional thing and work out a deal where the (chronically short-staffed) firm would not suffer from my jumping ship. What we agreed was that (A) I would stay until they found and hired my replacement, (B) I would stay and cross-train that person for four months, (C) they would give me an agreed-upon severance / bonus, and (D) they would work with me to help land me a new and better role elsewhere though the owners extensive network.  All-in-all, I thought this was very generous on my part - and, really, put a lot of the job-transition risk on myself. But I am a senior-ish person and relationships and reputations are very important in my line of work and I care about the people at my firm and wanted to do everything I could to do the \"right thing.\"  It took them  FIVE MONTHS  to find a replacement. And then I cross-trained that person for  TWO MONTHS . Then, via my own network, a job opened up with a near-immediate start date.  The job was too good to pass up. And I accepted. I tried to push the start date back, which I could have done (a little, at least), but then I would have received no cross-training in the new role and would have set myself up for failure.  This meant, unfortunately, I gave my current employer \"final\" notice of about a week and a half in an industry and at a seniority level where 30 days would be more typical. I know that this leaves them somewhat in a tight spot and scrambling. It's not ideal,  and it's not what I agreed to do . But it's a whole hell of a lot better than if I'd just found another job and given them 30 days notice out of the blue. If I could, I'd give them the whole time, but I cannot give up the opportunity I have in hand - that's just not an option.  I feel that I've done 90% of what I offered, that I've gone above and beyond to help ensure them a smooth(ish) transition and pass on my knowledge. I've promised to answer the phone when they call and encouraged them to reach out to me with questions on anything.  I've given up tens of thousands of dollars of lost earning power in this exchange .  The firm, however, has determined that I can go fuck myself. That I am not entitled to even a penny of that severance or of my regular (missed) bonus or of sacrificed vacation days or anything else. After a fight, they agreed to a week's salary as a \"good will\" gesture. They think, in fact, that I'm highly unprofessional, that I'm being selfish and immature, and am burning my bridges.  So, which is it, folks?  Am I the Asshole?\n",
      "A while back I (M23) had gotten hired at a reputable company in my area with good pay and benefits. I thought I had it made for me until a series of false accusations that I wont currently go into detail about got me and a few other team members fired. I had been keeping this from my folks for a while and kept telling them work was \"going fine\" in the following weeks. After a while I broke the news to my mom that I didn't work their anymore. She was disappointed but seemed to take it well initially. A while later I confessed my troubles to my grandmother as she has always been my best source of inspiration and advice in my life and has always helped me through times like these better than most anyone.   She calmed me down about the whole situation and felt better after talking to her about it. The next day she came out to my mom about how depressed she was having to deal with all of the family drama going on. My mother later texted me chewing me out saying that I'm \"making her pick up the pieces\" and \"draining what little life she has left\" (she is 83) and that I \"need to get my shit together and give her something to be proud of instead of disappointing her\". Thing is shes already going through a lot of stress dealing with a lot of other family issues such as my sister getting into legal trouble and falling behind in school. My mom has moved back in with her and they haven't always had the best relationship so grandma is also bearing the weight of adjusting to this as well, which she has vented to me about on several occasions. We've always had a relationship where we share our stresses with each other and help one another through tough times and laugh about it in the end, but this one really broke the camels back for her. I knew she was dealing with a lot of stress so I did feel some guilt bringing this up to her.  I just feel like I couldn't keep lying to her and had to come out to her about it. Can't tell whether or not I should've just kept my mouth shut about it and soldiered on until I found a better position. I have been searching tirelessly to find a new job and my mom is telling me to \"get my shit together\" as if I've been sitting on my ass this entire time.  I've since handsomely beefed up my design portfolio and put out several applications that I'm confident will get a response. I'm fully prepared to clap back with a strongly worded paragraph explaining my situation and am planning to conclude it with \"you talk so much about the stress I'm putting on her, you should hear what she has to say about you\". I've already dealt with 18 years of abuse from this woman so I'm not too concerned about her feelings at this point.  TL,DR: Confessed to my grandma that I lost my job and it worsened her depression and now my mother is very pissed.\n",
      "I have always been a pretty active person, mainly I tend to be pretty busy in my work/home life. A few years ago i joined a chat server, chatting and making a few friends that I’ve been in contact with for about 4 years now. One of them, I’ll call B, made his own server 3 years ago. He pumped a lot of time into building it and it was pretty active. Our group talked pretty regularly and everyone was pretty busy with work and home, with B pumping almost what seemed like everything he had into building on this server and trying to make others as well. I just thought that he was doing all of it for fun in his spare time.  B invited me to this main server and asked me to be a member of his staff, he added he knew that I’m pretty busy but that if I can just pop in to check on stuff every now and then, make sure rules were being followed, etc that would be what he needed me to do. He also had 7 other people who were higher ranked admins that were supposed to keep an eye on things 24/7. At the time this was okay and I worked it into checking on the server on my work lunch breaks.   About a year ago, B messaged me saying that something serious had happened and that he no longer had access to electricity at all. He had bumped me up to a higher level admin with all abilities he had at my disposal. He said that he wouldn’t have access for a few months and wanted me to contact the 7 to try to keep things going till he got back. I told him my work and home life still had me pretty busy but I’d let the 7 know and see what we could work out.  Only  3 people other than myself tried to keep it going. The server has a lot of sections B made himself that no uses or has ever done anything in. I’ve heard from B a few times since he left (and kept him updated on the status of things) and found out that he had been funneling all of his time and effort into this server, never got a job and was living with his parents but had gotten into several arguments over his lack of trying to contribute to the house or doing chores. While he is an adult, took his electronics and cut off his phone (all which they paid for), telling him to either get a job and start contributing or get out.   I havent heard from him since early last year and while I feel conflicted about it, I still wanted to keep things going so that if he did get things straightened out he could maybe find a balance and come back. He had put a lot of time into it and I didn’t want to let people down or let something he cared about fall apart. However, it got to where I was the only one checking in on things and members just started leaving. We are now at a complete stand still. I feel like I have failed but I was pretty open from the start that I don’t have enough time to run things, and while a few people have told me it’s not my fault, I feel like I ruined his server. AITA?\n",
      "So the short of this is I met this girl who I thought was really attractive and I asked her out on a date and she said yes. A few days before the date I was scrolling through her Facebook and there was a picture of her before her transistion with a beard. It was an instant turn off and I canceled the date telling her I had gotten back with my ex and I was sorry for wasting her time.   Later I was talking to my sister about the situation and how relieved I was to find out before the date and said she thinks I am being transphobic and it has me feeling shitty about the whole situation.

      "Hey, I never thought I'd post on here but my brain is going nuts trying to figure out if I am not a functioning member of society or if I simply live in a mental asylum.  Here we go: (Backstory) I live with my mum, my sister moved out a couple years ago and I finally had a room for myself. She recently got cosmetic surgery and is now staying in my room again so we can watch after her as she has trouble with a few basic everyday things. Now, she always sleeps in my room at night when I usually play with friends from the USA. So now I can't play with them but once she woke up in the morning when my friends weren't asleep and I asked \"yo, you awake? Can I play?\" and she said \"Okay sure.\"   I wander off into my room and start my pc, suddenly my mum busts in and yells at me \"why I woke my sister up\" and \"why I am such an inconsiderate animal\". I told her what had happened and she keeps yelling whar an insufferable, selfish pos I am. I go into the livingroom to see my sister crying for whatever reason and I explain to my mum that she and her are completely unreasonable. Now I am the bad guy again for doing absolutely nothing imo.  Please anybody tell me where did I go wrong cus I seriously am sick of my family.  TL;DR: i asked my sis if it was okay if I could play videogames with friends in the morning when she woke up, cus it's too loud at night and got yelled at by my mum for waking her up when I did not and various other things.\n",
      "My cousin , which we will call A., and I, had an argument about a thing that happened:I always have 200g of turkey rump for my evening break because i'm on a diet for obesity (-15kg of 30 lost atm) and i require them for macro reasons.She already saw me eating it and, the very first time i explained it to her, while i was eating, she asked if she could take a part, i told her \"really, it's a precise amount and i need it for diet\", she not only not gave a fuck, but took a part while telling me \"oh, a slice or two won't change anything\" while eating it.   Edit: this of the text happened several months ago  So, after telling you this, i'm telling the fact:I come back home, and my dad tells me \"A. came, and eat some of your turkey rump\", i am like WTF why you let her, so i went to check my fridge, and, of 200g, 50g vanished (scale-checked).I sent a message on her telling that she shouldn't have done that, because i need it and she knows it, she replied that i was too edgy and sent me home another 200g of that turkey rump. She told me that I'm boring and that, because hospitality rules, I shouldn't even tell her. I told her that it's not about hospitality, but it's about respect, because she knew that i needed the rump and that if she knew that i need it she shouldn't go in my fridge and eat whatever she finds.A. Replied that I'm extremely rude being this polemic, because she even repaired to the damage.Now, I actually think that this quarrel about 200 fucking grams of turkey rump is ridiculous, but i can't hold this rudeness of entering in my house with my dad and grandmother (she lives with me) and eat the food i required for dieting.\n",
      "I know how this may sound, but hear me out. My daughter (16F) and I (40F) have a great relationship. It’s just the two of us and her dad relinquished all of his rights. We’ve always been truthful with each other and always talk. She can be opinionated and we have nice debates. I think that’s one of the reasons I love her so much. Because she has her own opinions she also has her own style. It’s really cute for her and I always let her wear what she wants.  So a few days ago we went shopping and she found this really cute top. It kinda looks like a strapless bra, but not the bra material. It’s black and has this cute little white lace. Well I have this rule with her for clothes it’s “as long as it’s as long as or longer than your strapless bra goes it’s fine with me.” (That’s for clothes that are strapless)  Well sadly it wasn’t, but she really wanted it so I said as long as I can add maybe an inch of material it would cover the bra and she could wear it. (I learned how to sew a while ago and I still do it and she knows.) she agreed and we got that top and other clothes and went home.  Well she wanted to wear that top to a school event so I finished sewing the material on and it looked really cute. She tried it on and it fit really good.   So yesterday was the school event and she put the top on. When she walked downstairs I noticed it looked shorter than it was when I had sewn it.  I asked her about it and she truthfully said she took the sewn part off. I was shocked as she said she liked it. She proceeded to tell me that she just went braless and it was fun.   I normally don’t care if she goes braless cause I do too, but this shirt kinda falls down if you don’t wear one. (Trust me we tried to find solutions before we came to the conclusion I had to sew it.)  I told her she needed to wear a bra because I didn’t want her to accidentally flash someone because someone might be recording and record that. I said I could sew the part back on or she would have to wear something else.   She got mad at me and said I’ve never policed her before so why start doing it now. She went to her room changed and left, but before she left she hugged me and said I love you. (I’ve told her to never leave someone angry)  I feel bad for hurting we feelings, but I’ve had bad things happen to me before because of a shirt and I didn’t want that to destroy her self esteem.  So AITA for making her wear something else?  Edit: thank you guys for all those comments <3 im going to talk to her soon when she gets home from her friends house. She spent the night after the school event, but that was planned before this.  Edit 2: She got home and we talked it through. I also mentioned double sided tape that some of the nice commenters mentioned. We’re gonna best that out. Thank you everyone from both of us <3\n",
      "I was at a gym working out. I watched a guy next to me (nearest station) use weights and put them back on the rack. He then uses a medicine ball, scratches his nose in the process, touches his hands on the ball and puts it back. All without cleaning after use.  After he returns the equipment he goes to another machine and sits down and he begins to use it. I give him 2 min to see if he would remember to go back and clean his stuff, thinking he may have forgot. But he continues to remain in place.  So I go up and get his attention and politely say, “Hey bro, don’t forget to wipe off your equipment”.  He says, “I’m still using it”, even after it’s been returned to its position.  My reply is, “If it’s back on the racks people will assume it’s clean. If you put it back you should clean it, otherwise keep it with you”  His response was, “mind your own damn business”  This angered me. Not only is this bad practice during normal conditions, given the COVID pandemic, it’s even worse. I raise my voice and tell him to read the signs posted all around stating, “Sanitize equipment before and after each use” to which he responds again, “mind your own damn business”  At this point I raise my voice at him further. I tell him it takes 5 seconds to go and wipe off his equipment. He’s being lazy and inconsiderate. It is my business because someone could have touched it before it was cleaned.  He then says, “that’s not my job it’s theirs” referring to the managment. This angered me more, so I say “no it’s your job, get up and clean it”  He’s still talking back as he gets up to wipe it off. I follow him to make sure he cleans off the weights. Afterwards returns to sit down to which I say, “are you f-ing serious dude, clean off the medicine ball too”. At this point he just starts staring me down. I stare him down.  Some of the other patrons heard this argument (I was yelling at him pretty loud) and tell him to clean off his ball too. He does it looking all poopy faced. A few people are laughing at him as he walks back still staring me down like he wants to fight me.   I’m super angry so I clean off my stuff and leave notifying managment of what happened, after the fact.  I am not an employee of the gym just a member. I thought I was in the right but when I got home and told the story, I was told IATA because as soon as he responded I with “mind your own damn business” I should have deescalated and notified the staff. I should have been non-confrontational and let managment handle it, because the guy might have tried to fight me and it’s not my place to bully people into following the rules. I honestly felt obligated to do something because I was the one who saw it happen.   So AITA?  tl;dr: Guy used equipment without sanitizing after use despite signage indicating otherwise. Instead of letting managment handle the situation, I attempted to personally correct it on the spot resulting in me raising my voice and creating a confrontation.\n",
      "i (m17)  had varius boxes on my table to keep all my thing tidy and to find anything easily but my mother didnt like it so she decided to take everything i had on those boxes and spill them on my table and then throw away the boxes  bcs \"it looked untidy\" and \"its my house and i decide how it looks\"  but i could find evrything wich is a thing that before that i was unable to do and i kept it fairly clean nothing was out of place   also its my room i have the right to keep it as i want no? (as long as i keep it clean)   now i dont even know how to fix it bcs i dont have containers for my stuff and i put evrthing togheter in one box and obv my mother is not happy but like its her fault the only one who's suffering the consenquence of her actions is me bcs obviusly its really annoying having to search for minutes every time i want something   im also refusing to tidy the table bcs its her fault its like that why should i do it?\n",
      "A friend invited me to a \"make up party\" because her friend started selling products. It's a well known pyramid scheme I don't want to name.   I said yes to be nice and out of curiosity. My friend is hosting, her friend is selling. Apart from me there will only be one other guest there.   I do not have a lot of money atm. AiTA if I go to the party but don't buy anything? I probably have to spend a LITTLE money right? Would I be the asshole if I don't try the face lotions? I have incredibly sensitive skin.\n",
      "This isn't a case of just \"my bigoted nana\" to me. She was, but she was also someone I deeply loved who had a massive influence on the woman I am today, which is why this isn't a cut and dry issue of \"screw that, I'm going to do what I want!\" to me. I'm 20f (trans) and my nana and I got along so well until I came out as trans. I was considered an \"old soul\" kid (a term I now despise lol). I came out as a gay boy before I came out as a woman, and she was totally accepting of that for an old Catholic lady. She couldn't accept me as a woman (I came out at 14), and our relationship had been really strenuous to her death. I still like to think she loved me, and if she was given more time, she might have made progress.  My parents, who have been very supportive of me, don't think it would be right for me to wear a dress to her funeral. I thought it was fair because it was her funeral, and I sent my mum a pic of a more androgynous outfit I put together, and she said it still looks very feminine on me and nana would have liked a suit, like my brothers will be wearing.  I don't own any women's suits and I can't afford to buy one (I'm currently an unemployed student). My boyfriend asked his sister if I could borrow one of hers, which was a joke because I have been can't-reach-the-top-shelf tiny my whole life, and they are a family of Dutch giants. It didn't fit, of course. The issue is, even if I were to find a suit, I can't pass as a \"feminine boy\" anymore...so what is the point? Then I'll just look like a masculine woman at nana's funeral. This funeral isn't about me. I don't care how I look at it. I'm not particularly religious but I like to think there's a life after death and nana will be able to see this, and I frankly have no clue what I'm supposed to do. It's an irrational anxiety (welcome to my life) but I've been so worried about disrespecting my nana at her funeral. My boyfriend says she'd just be happy that I showed up. I don't know if that's true.  I'm leaning towards not wearing one because I can't afford one. My mum got very upset with me about that, but my boyfriend says it's just because she's grieving. I will try to go no makeup, more androgynous, but I partially feel like my mum is right and this will ruin my nana's funeral for the woman we're supposed to be giving respect to.\n",
      "My roommate (25) made brownies a few days ago, he offered me (27) some of his brownie. I declined, but he offered them up for whenever I would like them. I came home yesterday, and there was a 4\"×4\" piece left. So I cut a third out of it and ate it. When on about my evening. I come home today, the same piece is still there. Would I be the asshole to eat the whole last piece?\n",
      "I went to subway today, and the guy making my sandwich had awesome hair. It was in dreads, tied up on top of his head so the bleached ends were all sticking out kinda like a koosh ball (that's a dumb comparison but it's all I can think of) and some of the dreads had these little gold ringlets on them, I thought it was really cool, so I said ''Hey I love your hair, those ring things are really cool\" and the guy said thanks in kind of a monotone/emotionless voice, but he talked like that the whole time we were there so I figured that was just how he talked. After we left, my friend told me I shouldn't have said anything, and that it sounded like I was making fun of him, and that he doesn't need approval from some random white guy. Said friend is mixed, her mom is black and her dad is white, I didn't mean anything by the comment, I genuinely just thought his hair was really cool. AITA?  &#x200B;  Edit for clarity: I wasn't on the subway like a train, I was at a subway like the sandwich restaurant\n",
      "Some background: I moved in with my ex about 3 years ago, she helped me out financially for the first year and half. We split up just over a year ago but remained friends. The house we rented in was in her name and once we split up we paid half each to everything – bills, rent etc I’d transfer her my share each month. I got a better paying job about a year ago and would give her money now and then and pay for most of the food. She got pregnant (not my child) in May and moved back ho her parents and would stay at weekends. The agreement me and her made was that she would pay £150 a month. The rent was £850 and bills came to around £150 so we just made the deal that she would pay all the bills and I would pay all the rent and she would come over on weekends.  Around November time she just stopped coming round, after a few weeks I asked her why and she said she was too pregnant to make the journey. I moved out at the start of January (handed the keys back/tenancy ended).   The deposit was all hers. I bought boxes, cleaning products, packed all her things for her, cleaned the flat from top to bottom with a friend of mine which took about 4 days – I paid him £150 and bought him food each day for helping. She didn’t visit the flat again after November so I did everything to get her stuff ready and her deposit back.  It came to about a week go and she said the bills came to £330 (bills are usually taken every 3 months and she called the companies and asked how much she owed) so this was roughly two months of bills needing to be paid. She asked me to pay £210. I felt this was unfair and proposed that we split it 50/50 (I even felt like a bit dirty in the sense that I felt I was being taken advantage of when I suggested that). She said she hadn’t been there so hadn’t used any water/electricity and she couldn’t believe I was asking her to pay that much of the bills and that she’d helped me out before.  From my side, I said that her paying the bills was just the way we structured the deal that she’d pay £150 a month, and it didn’t mean that she would pay the bills because it was what she used. I could have paid £700 a month rent and the bills and it is the same thing. She chose not to use the place on weekends even though she had the option. I paid my friend and spent days cleaning and packing for her and so she could get her deposit back. In terms of her saying she helped me out in the past – that’s true but that was when we were together and she has since got pregnant with someone else’s baby so for me I’m thankful that she did at the time but that isn’t something she should say/use to try to get my to pay more. I already saved her a few hundred quid by cleaning and getting her deposit back.  I paid her the £210 in the end but I felt like I was getting very taken advantage of and felt uncomfortable about it/like it wasn’t right. While she was trying to make me feel like I was in the wrong here.\n",
      "Okay,   So my brother moved in with me six months ago. He's not working, he doesn't really have many friends (plus, covid, I guess), and unless he's out drinking he's on my couch hanging out with my pets.  He helps out. Cleaning , organizing, cooking, walking the dog, and at first I really appreciated it.   But, for the past few months I've been over it. I don't want a house spouse, and if I wanted one I'd get one that wears a different cologne and spends less time in the bathroom.   Detail: We live in a 1 bedroom, 1 bath apartment.   I feel like I don't really get quality time with my pets and it drives me crazy to see my dog following him around. (The cats have remained loyal, despite him constantly trying to get their attention--even when they're sitting with me. I honestly, think it's a game for him. )   My routine used to be that I'd come home from work, walk my dog for about half an hour, shower, cook, and then hang out on the couch with my beasties.   That doesn't happen anymore. I usually go to my room. If I want to watch something its at my desk. If I'm working on a project it is at my desk and not at my coffee table.   So, the only real chance I have for cuddles are when I turn in for the night or I make a point to lounge in bed, which I try to do on the weekends.  I've asked my brother to not take my dog for long walks anymore because I want to walk her.   My dog is relatively old and really only has one good walk in her a day. When my brother takes my dog for a long walk it feels like I don't get any time with my dog and it sucks! She's *my* dog. I pay for all her meds, all her food, all her vet visits and it's me that takes her out when it's cold and not fun (for me, she loves it), and it's me who wakes up early to take her out.  I feel like I'm getting all the less great parts of having a dog, while not getting any of the enjoyment.   When I told my mom that I've asked my brother not to take my dog for long walks she said I was being selfish. That my brother and my dog have their own relationship and I shouldn't take that away from them.   That it's too controlling.   And just !!! Is it too controlling? And, I feel like I'm crazy for getting mad/jealous/annoyed over this?   Maybe I am? IDK, this is such a small stupid thing.\n",
      "I want to buy my boyfriend a phone. He broke his last one and is now using a shitty old phone, and he really loved his last phone and sometimes mentions that he misses it, but he was putting off buying it again because he doesn’t like spending money on himself (money is not an issue for him in general). It got discontinued a few months ago (which he doesn't know), is out of stock and I found someone who’s selling an unused one second hand, so at this point it’s really a now or never situation. He really did love it - and he uses his phone  a lot  for work so if his phone works well, it makes a positive difference in his mental state (nobody likes dealing with slow technology all the time).  But here's why I think it might be an asshole thing to do. We have a great relationship but I'm a people pleaser, and we’ve spoken a few times about how my constant thoughtful gestures makes him feel bad. He’s by no means neglectful, but I have a (bad?) habit of seriously bending over backwards to do things for people I love. Even though he’s definitely considerate of my needs too and I’m perfectly happy with the slight imbalance, I realize that I sometimes take it too far. He has said that he sometimes feels like he’s in my debt, and it makes him feel inadequate and uncomfortable. It was hard for him to express because on the surface \"you're too thoughtful and do too much for me\" is a strange complaint to have, but I can see where he's coming from so I've been trying to dial it back. He’s since thanked me for it and said he feels like we're better balanced now, and I can see how me buying the phone as a gift, especially with the elaborate thought process behind that decision, might make him feel shitty again.  It’s a great deal, and the phone in general is comparatively inexpensive (a mid range Android) so it’s not a money thing. I’d just forward the information to him and let him buy (or not), but we’re currently in different countries, and the second hand seller is in my neighborhood and doesn’t ship internationally, so I’m the only one who can buy the phone. I could still forward the information to the boyfriend and let him make the decision and then just pay me back, but I tried to do this months ago when the phone was on sale, and he really does hate spending money on himself, so he put the decision off for too long and the sale ended.  I really want him to have a phone he loves and can get positive emotion from. I’m not just trying to do this for good girlfriend points. At the same time I realize how doing something like this could be problematic in the context of our discussions. So, WIBTA if I just went and bought it?  TL;DR: I want to buy my boyfriend a phone he loves, but he's said before that it makes him feel bad when I do overly thoughtful things for him.\n",
      "I'm an 18F who just graduated with an AA this year. I go to college (as much as this semester will let me with all the waitlists going on lol) and I work with my dad at the family business full-time. I'm by no means a bum nor do I mooch off my parents. I've never once asked them for money, I do chores, and even if I do have a smart mouth, my parents understand my humor and they do the same stuff back at me.  I'm living with my parents while I go to school and since my grandma has passed away (my grandpa's wife) he moved in with my family. We all live in my father's house. It's been stressful, since my grandad and my dad don't really get along, but my mom is pretty complacent/awkward with the situation since he is HER dad. Which I totally get and respect.  But the dynamic has gotten even worse within the past few weeks. And my granddad and I have ALWAYS gotten along, but ever since we moved in together, he mistakes me joking with my parents as being \"rude\" or \"spoilt\", even when my parents themselves don't think so. He will try to parent me, tell me to do things, and try to tell me what I should be doing in college. He thinks that if I'm not taking 6 classes at once I should move out and get a job and get my own apartment.  Not to sound like someone who makes excuses, but I cannot financially afford that right now, nor do I want to move out. My dad has told me I can live with them as long as I want to as long as I play by their rules, which I always have, so I'm in no danger from them. The problem is now, my grandpa keeps telling me every time he sees me that, \"You're a grown up, you should go and get out on your own.\"  I snapped back finally, and I told him that I loved him as my grandfather, but he isn't my parent who can tell me when, how, or why I should move out. This comment put my family on a swivel, and ever since I feel like an AH about it. I understand he might've just been trying to help me, but the way he says it comes across very condescending and he doesn't fully understand what the world is like right now. So AITA?\n",
      "Long time lurker, first time poster.   Background:  I (25M) work as a production manager for a printing business that makes physical promotional/advertising material for other businesses/organizations and have been working at this business in my current position for ~5 months and have been working there total for 8 months. In my capacity, I make stickers, wall prints, window prints, and the sort and oversee the entire production process,  from the digital art to end product. I am a one person department, and am accordingly also responsible for inventory management and machine maintenance.   Though I am respected by my boss and colleagues, I do not believe I'm paid appropriately for the work that I do and the gravity of my responsibilities. For context, I make something like $13-$14 an hour whereas most other similar positions in the same industry pay something like $17-$20 an hour.   As well, the business where I work has no kind of health insurance policy in place. Since I will be 26 towards the end of this year, I will lose my existing coverage that I get from my parents. I was assured several months ago from my boss (whom is also the owner) that health insurance would come by the middle of this year, but it's not seemingly going to happen in light of the current epidemic.  Where I May Be TA:  Just today, I found an ad for a similar position that is to pay quite a bit more than what I'm paid right now. Additionally, said business is located closer towards my end of town and would make the commute easier overall. As a result, I'm extremely tempted to apply for it.   However as stated previously, where I work I am a ONE person department. Every and all incoming orders are entirely on ME to take care of. There is no one currently onboard that could realistically take over my position in any short amount of time. And though business overall is a bit slower due to the epidemic, we still in fact have jobs coming in and going out. I am concerned that if I were to apply and something came of it (a fairly likely chance), it may end up making serious complications for my current workplace as it is considerably unlikely that they would be able to find anyone to fill in any short amount of time.   So, WIBTA for applying for a better paying job even though it could/would cause serious problems for my current workplace?\n",
      "There’s a girl that’s a mutual on one of my social media’s, and I just found her. She has in her bio that she’s a nursing assistant now, and a future doctor. I scrolled through her profile, and saw some pretty revealing pictures, and also some talking about her using cocaine. I messaged her asking if she was aware that some people who hire doctors and nurses check their social media.     She told me they didn’t. They definitely do. I told her that if she posts pictures that have her breasts completely out, and talking about the use of drugs, she could have problems finding a job. I asked some of my friends, and they told me I was the asshole for not letting her be body positive and post what she wants.      Take a look at my Reddit. I’m not one to *ever* tell a woman not to post her body, because I post mine all the time. She obviously just hadn’t been told that posting nude pictures can bite her in the butt. I’m now being lectured by my followers on not letting her be body positive. I just thought I was looking out for her. I don’t 100% agree with the fact you shouldn’t be allowed to post your body and not be hired, but everyone seems to think I’m an asshole for telling her to be careful, though I had no malicious intent here.    AITA?  My message said this exactly: More and more places hiring professional people are checking their social media and I wouldn’t want years of your med school to go to waste!   Edit: I’m on mobile, so if it formats strangely, I apologize.\n",
      "This happened yesterday. Me and my mom were working outside and I had been very depressed all day because of a breakup that happened a week before and because of some, comments about myself said by my step father. My best friend is the only person I go to whenever I’m this bad and whenever I do she doesn’t say anything besides saying she is here for me. But yesterday whenever I asked, with tears going down my face, if I could go to my friends house so he could calm me down. I offered to pay for the gas I used in her car and then work outside on everything else by myself for that day. She responded by saying she was tired of me using the, “same old excuse” to get out of work and screamed at me to shut up when I started crying harder because she said that. So I’m going to ask the smartest people I know. Reddit. Am I The Asshole for wanting to go to my friends house instead of working outside?\n",
      "My younger sister (14f) and I (18f) have been living with our grandma since our parents died when we were little. She has sacrificed so much for us, including her relationship with our grandpa who wanted to put us in foster care and left when she took us in. We were taught about safe sex and our grandma let us know that we could always talk to her, but my sister got pregnant anyway. She doesn't want to abort or give the baby up for adoption (which is totally her choice) and is basically expecting our grandma to raise the child while she finishes school for the next 4 years and then give the child back to her when she graduates. Family is extremely important to our grandma and she feels obligated to do this for her great-grandchild. I feel like my sister is taking advantage of her generosity. She raised our mom and both of us. She doesn't need to be responsible for a baby while she's in her 70s. WIBTA if I let her know that she is not obligated to do this and she is not a bad person if she declines? If our grandma doesn't take the baby, my sister will drop out of school to care for him/her. She is vehemently against abortion and adoption. I am torn because I don't want to be the reason my sister cuts her education short, but I also don't want my grandma to pay for my sister's irresponsibility.\n",
      "(Sorry if my english isn’t perfect, it’s not my mother language and I’m writing in my phone so, sorry in advance)  For context, my birthday is tomorrow, I normally never celebrate my birthday on the day because I like to spend it on me-time and wanting to be alone. Some friends and part of my family think that is weird but I just like it that way. Let me be on my birthday and another day near it I’ll celebrate it.  This week has been rough, lot of work and tests from college and I really don’t want to do anything. My friends told me early on the week that they wanted to celebrate over discord but I really don’t want to. I was polite and told them “if they wanna make a celebration they can, but I don’t think that I’ll be much time cos I don’t really like the celebration over video chat”. They started telling me that I was a “boring dude for not wanting to celebrate” and “that I was a grandpa for not liking video chat” but in reality, I just don’t feel like it.  Now, one of my friends wants to make a “party over discord with no celebrating intentions” but she want it to start at 10:30 - 11:00 pm and I know that she wants to make time to wait until 00:00 am to celebrate. I don’t know how to tell them that I don’t want to do it.  So reddit, WIBTA if I tell my friends that I don’t wanna celebrate my birthday??  Edit: thank you so much for your comments!! I think that I should update so here it goes:  After I posted this, I talked with some of my friends and we decided to start the call at about 9:30 pm and played some Gartic Phone. We drank and chat for a bit and was all good. At around 11:00 - 11:20 I said that I would go to bed cos I was really tired. We called it a day and everyone seemed happy except for the friends who organized this. I really feel sorry for her cos she planed this, but I really don’t like celebrating my birthday on the same day, so I think I landed in a good middle ground. Being in the call for a bit and then go to sleep before midnight. But at the end everything went well. So thank you guys so much for your comments and advices!\n",
      "I recently became the manager of a small hotel. Yesterday, after I clocked out, I was chatting with one of my employees before heading home. A customer came in and I decided that I would go ahead and program the room key cards before I left while my employee was checking the customer in. On the computer it showed the customer's name twice. Our computer had need having a slight glitch where it sometimes does that, but it could also mean that they have 2 rooms.  Me \"Is it glitching again or are those different rooms?\" Employee \"I don't know.\" We both look at the customer to see if they know. Customer  busy on their phone  Me \"Do you know how to check?\" Employee  shakes head   I walk over to show her how. Me \"Just click here and hover over each of the names. It should show the confirmation numbers. If they are the same, it's just a glitch.\" Employee * gives me a weird look* \"Ok, I got it.\" Then I go finish making the room key for them. Before I can leave it turns out that the battery in there door is dead. I switched the rooms in the computer, make a new key card for the room next to the one they were originally put in, and blocked the room since we are out of door batteries. I grab my stuff, say something about needing to grab dinner, and head out.  Today I come in and my assistant manager asks to have a word with me. Apparently the customer who checked in while I was leaving complained that I was being insubordinate and rude to a superior. (The employee was older than me so I guess that they made an assumption?) Since the employee had just gotten off the assistant manager called them to see what was up. The employee tells my assistant manager that I was \"out of line\", \"aggressive\", that I \"came at them\", and \"violated their personal space\". I have no idea. The only one that I can see making sense is the personal space one maybe? I did walk over to point at the computer screen when showing them what to do, but we were still several inches apart.  This isn't the first time that this person has complained about me to the assistant manager though. Before I was promoted they complained about me all the time. Everything from me not talking the empty trash out because several hours after I left it was full, to me not leaving a note I was supposed to leave because she couldn't find it. The old manager looked at the cameras and dismissed all of them because it was obvious that I wasn't doing anything wrong.  Anyway, my assistant manager thinks that I should apologize. They said that I might have seemed rude or aggressive because I was in a hurry to head out, but I don't know if I should. I don't think that I did anything wrong and I'm pretty sure that the employee is just seeing what they can get away with blaming on me like they tried to do under the old manager.   So, AmITheAsshole and what should I do?  Edit    I am over the assistant manager. They asked to talk to let me know what happened while I was off the clock. They also gave me their opinion, which I I'm considering.   To be honest, I wrote off the customer complaint. I figured it was just because either they didn't think I should have done tech support in front of them or that they thought I shouldn't have told my \"boss\" what to do. Also, they complained about the employee interaction while complaining about having to switch rooms due to the door battery so . . . 🤷🏼‍♀️\n",
      "Yesterday one of my friends impromptu invited me to a dinner today to celebrate another friend’s birthday who we were unable to celebrate during her actual bday because life. Technically I did already make it up to this friend last week 1 on 1 and celebrated with her, but I still would like to see my other friends and celebrate. My boyfriend gets really bad acid reflux due to a condition called gerd. He knows that pepperoni and pizza sauce trigger it more so than other foods. Last night he didn’t want to spend money on dinner so instead made a frozen pepperoni pizza that we happened to have in the freezer. Well he spent all night waking up in pain and then had to call off work today because he can’t stop vomiting. Overall, he’s feeling pretty miserable, which I sympathize with and feel very bad he’s hurting. However, I told him I’d take care of him when I get home following the dinner (have to head there directly from work). He responds how he’ll probably be sleeping by then and doesn’t need anyone to take care of him. He then follows up with “if you were feeling this way you would not be ok with me going out” to which I responded not if you already had plans. Also, tbh even if something came up last minute I would never tell him I need him to stay here and take care of me unless I legit needed someone there because I was immobile. Now he won’t respond to any of my texts and is ignoring me. He has me contemplating canceling with my friends, but I don’t really want to and think he’s being a little overdramatic. If I go to dinner, AITA?\n",
      "I am a new driver, about 3 weeks now, so I am still learning and would like someone to tell me if I was in the wrong.  T junction during very slow traffic. I am on the minor road in stationary traffic and the traffic on the other road is also stationary. I'm about 4-5 cars back and when crawling forward I notice cars are merging 1-2-1 or zipper? So I follow suite and as I get closer I wait for the car in front to go, then the next car on the major road, then I start to roll out. But I then realise a giant lorry to my right isnt going to let me go and so I brake, he brakes, and now I'm blocking him. So he tries to go around me and I go forwards to continue. Eventually it's fine but he got pretty angry at me, turning on his full beams while directly behind me then later pulling in front and rolling down his window to shout at me.  While I'm not phased at his reaction, I just want to know if I made the error so I don't make it again. I don't want to be a poor driver. I realise at a T junction I am to give way. But at such a slow crawl during rush hour I was just doing what others did to keep the flow of traffic smooth.\n",
      "I'll save the sob story, but basically my dad left before I was even born, so he was only briefly in my brother's life as he was a baby. Neither of us really knew him. My bio-mom quickly descended into drug abuse and me and my brother were taken into state custody at 3 and 4. She died not too long after.   I was lucky, and was taken in (and eventually adopted) by an amazingly supportive family. I  had an amazing childhood. We weren't particularly wealthy or anything extraordinary in that regard, but I was well loved and very much cared for. I eventually went to my dream school and go an amazing job that I love and I live a pretty good life. Still, I am in therapy and have some residual issues that I am actively working on. However, I am mostly always incredibly grateful for the life I get to live, all things considered.   My brother was taken in by a family I know little about, but from what I have gathered, they were some pretty vile people.   I kinda knew this growing up because they barred me from seeing my brother, no matter how much my parents begged for me to have a relationship them.   He recently found me and reached out on social media. I have no clue how he did this-- I have a generic name and I changed my last name once to my family's (generic) last name when I was adopted and then again recently to my now husband's last name (which happens to also be generic). I cannot figured out how he did it... which wouldn't strike me as immediately creepy, but it does now considering his behavior.   Anyway... we lived about four hours apart and I thought it would be nice to reconnect and catch up. Within five minutes of meeting him, he had said the n-word loudly at a table as a \"joke,\" insulted my husband as a \"joke,\" and stared at our waitresses breasts in a very obvious and uncomfortable way. He's just awful. The whole night he talked only about himself and how terrible everything is in his life (which i would understand if he showed any sort of self-reflexivity) and how horrible everyone else is.   Since our meeting all he has done is ask me for $4k or to live in my guest bedroom, help him get a job at my company (he has no degree or experience in the field), and continue to say inappropriate things to me and my husband. He's also friended lots of my close friends and family indicating that he is my brother (and only real \"BLOOD\" relative) and his facebook is quite frankly a disaster. It's clear he is mentally unstable, but that is no excuse for his behavior. He tells me he needs me in his life as he has nothing. I do not want to be at all. I don't like him. He's cruel. I also feel like he is using me...  Would I be the asshole if I cut him off and did not continue to rebuild the relationship? He said his family never technically adopted him and so when he turned 18 he was pretty much on his own. I would feel really bad abandoning him, but he is making my life increasingly difficult.\n",
      "This one is from a while back, but I want to crowdsource judgement on this, because its bothered me for a while.  I(29m at the time) and my ex (25f at the time.) were bantering back and forth about which one of us had made a particularly witty joke to the other... I know, super sophisticated. But I remembered that I had sent it to her via text message so I just went to the evidence that was conveniently in my phone.  My ex then went on about how its creepy that I had old text messages from her( they were about a year old.) and I went on to say well honestly I have like every text message from almost everyone, with a few exceptions that were either letting go of an ex or some other unpleasant memory, and I just never think to delete them unless I am trying to get rid of them.  She then said that she never keeps any text messages in her phone, and that's its super creepy to keep old messages forever.  I still don't delete text messages, but I have always wondered if I am breaking some weird taboo by not doing so.  AITA for not deleting old text messages?\n",
      "Me and my gf went out for icecream after dinner last night. She changed out of her work clothes (just jeans and a shirt) to a sundress.   I said, \"Babe, you don't need to dress up, we're just going to Dairy Queen.\"  She said, \"I'm not dressing up, I'm just in a dress.\"  I said, \"Isn't that the definition of DRESSing up though?\"  She got angry with me, told me I'm always stupid, and broke up with me.  I didn't mean to tell her what she can and cannot wear (what some of my friends said I did), I was really trying to say she looked perfectly fine before and didn't need to put in any effort.\n",
      "I'd just come home from university so had moved all my stuff back home. My brother's girlfriend (BGF) really has no understanding of privacy and always just walks into my room, even when I'm not home and have left the door shut and always asks to borrow my stuff.  Bit of background: they had been together about 5 months at this point and she lives an hour or so away so she used to come and stay at our house for a few nights every week or so. She's entitled and manipulative, my mum and I aren't fans but we are hoping my brother will work out she's crazy on his own.   I wake up early one day and head to work, as usual, my brother was also at work but my mum and BGF are at our house.  She decided that she wanted to clear out my room, without asking me first, and get it all done in a day for when I came home. My mum agreed and helped her for a little bit, but eventually left to run some errands and do some work.  This meant that basically, she took loads of my stuff and just put it into bin bags to be thrown away, barely looked through it, a lot of the stuff I have in my room is pretty new, and I'm also a massive make-up fiend so I have lots of new and expensive make-up all the time. For me, my bedroom is a private place and has loads of personal things I wouldn't wanna share or have people snoop through. BGF doesn't understand privacy, for her I believe she just wanted to know where things were in my room. Long story short, BGF ends up with 10 bin bags worth of stuff.  I had a lot of shit in my room, so basically it would have been impossible to go through it all properly and organise it, this is what I had been planning to do with my friend for a while so I felt a bit defeated and annoyed, as my friend would always tell me to not even start sorting without her (her dream job is to be a home organiser and sorter).  I came home that night to be told what she had been doing all day. I was panicking inside because she doesn't know me well enough to know what I would want to keep or throw out. I don't know her well enough to have a go at her and didn't wanna make it awkward for my brother. I was so so pissed off, it's my space, but it doesn't feel like mine anymore because I don't know where anything is, I now have to ask BGF where my make up remover and skincare stuff is etc. I don't even have her number to ask her any of this!  My brother and mum see I'm annoyed and call me ungrateful and that she was just trying to help. From BGF's point of view, I understand she was just trying to help me, she also said to my brother that she was trying to help me 'get my life in order and give me the motivation to better myself'. Since this event, I've mentioned it to a few close friends and family to see what they thought and they have all said that BGF was in the wrong and shouldn't have done this unless I'd asked her too or she had asked my permission first.  But what do you guys think? AITA?\n",
      "I (19m) was playing a video game with my sister (17f—almost 18). We both like this game, and we usually have lots of fun; it’s often our motivation to roll out of bed, in fact. We’re close siblings. We like to ask each other a lot of silly (or less silly) “what if” and “would you rather” questions.  The game is a shooter, and (like a lot of games) there are different characters with different abilities. She asked me what I might replace one character’s ability with, but I wasn’t sure if she meant Dahlia (the character I was playing as at the time) or another character. I don’t want to dump info, because the game company didn’t pay me to advertise, but basically, if she meant Dahlia, I was confused because Dahlia’s abilities are more or less dependent on each other. I began to ask what she meant—not in a rude/sarcastic way—and asked how this was different from just making a new character with one ability from one character and one from another, assuming we were talking about Dahlia.  She became increasingly frustrated, but I thought she was half-joking, so I kept asking about stuff like that and also when she was being sarcastic since it’s hard for me to tell when she is being sarcastic sometimes. It became obvious pretty soon that she was actually angry, and she kept saying how idiotic I am and began mocking my asking when she was being sarcastic. She quit the game and kept insulting me, and I continued to play since I felt bad for our teammates.  I started getting a bit frustrated myself since I was confused by why she was angry, which I guess is a bit hypocritical, but I tried to stay calm. I tried to clarify a bit more forcefully that I didn’t know how to answer and that I needed more information. Eventually, I understood the question after she clarified something she hadn’t before, so I was able to answer. When I answered, she still lashed out at me and kept saying how stupid it was that I had to clarify such a simple question that was never supposed to be serious in the first place. I told her we could talk about it later once she calmed down.  She continued insulting me when I left the room. I went to use the washroom afterwards, and she knocked on the door and told me she was sorry for being mean and said she just got frustrated because I always take things too seriously.  For (relevant?) context, my sister has diagnosed depression, social anxiety, general anxiety, PTSD, etc. I have diagnosed OCD and phobia.  AITA?\n",
      "Hi, this post probably sounds super petty and people who don't game might not understand where my frustration and loneliness is coming from. Please try to bear with me.  My (21) gf (19) and I have been together for over 2 years now. We are both gamers. We enjoy playing League of Legends (I know it's a toxic game) but that game is like a drug and never let's go once you get to a certain point.   We have a usual discord group who we play with on a daily basis and usually if there are more than 5 people who want to play (max number of players allowed in a party), we usually create custom games so nobody is left out.  Anyway, tonight was no different than usual. More and more people start to get on and I am in a party of 2, waiting for 3 people to come back from whatever chores they had to do so we can play. My gf is showering during this time and not in the initial 3 people we were waiting for but when she comes back, coincidentally so do the others.  I ask the people in the call if we should do customs, because there's currently more than 5 people waiting to play, but they just all replied no, they wanted to complete missions. I said nothing and understood. They then ask HER to play and create a new lobby inviting everyone but replacing me with my gf.   Initially I was a bit uncomfortable that I was disregarded that easily, so I decided to wait through two of their games (around 40 minutes). After both games they did not even bother messaging me, asking me in call, or inviting me to a game.   I got increasingly upset as I then proceeded to go play 2 ranked games by myself and leaving their call. During these three hours my gf did not bother msging me or checking up on me or asking why I left the call. It made me feel excluded and forgotten.   When she finally asked if I wanted to play, at 2:30am, I already wanted to sleep. I told her and explained why and what I was upset with but all she said was along the lines of \"and why are you so upset\" , \"we were waiting for you after every game\". She was being super defensive and non apologetic.  If they were really waiting for me,  why wouldn't they just send a simple msg or ask in the call if I wanted to play??? Why do  I  always have to be the one asking to join and be invited? It makes me really feel like I don't belong in the group sometimes and my gf feels like I'm over reacting and now she's mad at ME for just leaving without notice. she does not understand at all.  AITA?\n",
      "I’m half Japanese and am planning on visiting my family this Summer in Japan. As I explain that to her, she asks me if I speak Mandarin. Confused, I ask her what she’s talking about and tell her that Japanese people speak Japanese, not Mandarin. She then exclaims that she thought all Asians spoke mandarin. I was rightfully confused and a little upset that she said this and kinda laughed it off, but i then told her “that was a pretty ignorant thing to say”. I didn’t realize right away and found out a little later that she was kinda hurt by that comment and other people were telling me I overreacted or was being mean to her and that I should’ve said it in a less hurtful way.  In her defense, she comes from a very small town where the population is mostly white, but I was always under the assumption that not all Asians speak the same language and that the country they live in will most likely speak a different language. I figured this was taught in all schools, but apparently not. She’s 22 so I thought she should know better.   Could I have said something “nicer”? Yes. But was I an asshole to straight up call out her ignorance? Or was I justified\n",
      "Hey fellow assholes! Alt account; my friend might see this.   Edit  I've explained a bit in the comments about why so much time has passed: I'm really ambivalent about getting involved at this point. I think she deserves to know and make her own decision, but I wish she could find out in a way that doesn't involve me. Despite suggestions to the contrary, I'm very anti-drama and have not regularly checked her Facebook (which is mostly locked anyway).  &#x200B;  About two years ago, my best friend told me his longtime girlfriend had confessed to cheating on him several times with a guy at work. I didn't ask too much about this other guy, but later found out from a mutual friend that the Other Man is married and the cursory Facebook sleuthing I had done to identify the guy was accurate. My BFF and his girl tried to work through it but eventually broke up, and nobody ever told the Other Man's wife about the dalliance. My BFF doesn't want to get involved and is just over the whole thing.  &#x200B;  (Based solely on social media, admittedly,) This guy's wife appears to be a TOTAL GODDAMN SWEETHEART. She has posted (not constantly/braggingly or annoyingly) some photos with her husband and seems 100% gaga over him. She is endlessly positive and adores her husband, who she's been with for over a decade. I don't know this woman and I don't have any particular emotional attachment to her situation (I'm female, married, never been cheated on to my knowledge), but my heart breaks for her.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: WIBTA for sending her an anonymous message advising her of her husband's long-ago affair? Asshole because I suspect it might be to absolve myself of guilt for knowing about it all this time. Asshole because maybe he just did it with this one person to get it out of his system (I suspect he & wife were high school sweethearts or something), and I don't want to potentially blow up their lives just to make myself feel better.  &#x200B;  THANKS!\n",
      "We have room for her and could easily have the stepmom come if we wanted. My mother has no issue with my stepmom or father, and has actually encouraged me to invite the stepmom. Mom said it's totally up to me, but reminded me that when she remarried she invited my dad and stepmom.  The reason I don't want to invite my stepmom is I'm a lesbian, marrying a woman, and my stepmom is homophobic.  Dad says it's just how she was raised, but I was raised in a homophobic environment too (mom and dad have since reevaluated some stuff and become a lot more accepting but it took some work). Then he said it's a generational thing but she's only 15 years older than me and technically we're from the same generation.  I'm also inviting my stepdad to the wedding with mom. I feel like if it was just my birth parents who were invited I'd get away with it but to invite both parents, and stepdad but not stepmom would definitely cause drama.  Truthfully, I don't want my stepmom there. At all. She's insanely homophobic but it's also important to me that both my dads are there and IDK if my birth dad will still go if I tell him that stepmom can't come, and I'd be putting him in a really awkward situation.  WIBTA for excluding her on the invites and telling dad he can't bring her?  Update: I called dad, spoke to him at length about my decision and why I'd come to it. He's not coming to my wedding.\n",
      "For context, I (21F) and my housemate (23F) live together in a house, to save on rent costs and because we are very close and looked forward to living with each other.  I love her to bits, but today we got into a bit of an argument over some unwashed pots. Basically, she stays with her bf 5 days a week, and often when she does stay over she cooks, eats, sleeps and then leaves. So this has accumulated to a few mouldy pots. She works a hard job so I haven't really brought it up. This is also because when I once asked her to rinse a bowl out of mine that she had used, she snapped back that I hadn't washed one of her pans. I apologised and did it right away. I also rinsed out my own bowl.  She hasn't been around for a week and her pot pile up is now starting to go mouldy again and usually she has cleaned them up by this time. It has annoyed me but I have been scared to make her mad at me so kept my mouth shut. She visited a few times in the last week to pick up some things, but never once did her pots.  Now, today I got an angry text from her that said \"The Fridge situation is starting to take the piss, can you leave me more room please?\". Now, I must admit, I had an instant bad reaction to it. This is owing to the fact that whilst yes, I probably take up around 60% of the fridge space, that is because I am here the majority of the week unlike herself, the fact she didn't say anything else to me via text, and also because she has a mason jar of things in there alongside a wine bottle and LOTS of cheese. So I came out of my room and said to her \"look, with the fridge situation, idk what you want me to do. I use and eat these things. It's mostly bread and butter too\" (we share these things). She shot back along the lines of \"Well, there's yoghurts in there too\" (Like I'm not allowed to have yoghurts in my fridge? To clarify, there's 5 little pots of creme brulee and like 3 tube ones, so it takes up about 1/4 of ONE shelf).  I got mad. Mainly because I have never text her passively aggressively about things like her pots, or her mouldy food in the fridge which I have thrown out, or the fact she leaves plates and cups in the living room for days on end. So I snapped back \"Well can you please do the pots in the kitchen? They're getting mouldy.\"  She said \"Yes but I am in a rush today so I cannot\" and then went into the shower where I went into my room after she left. I didn't want to start an argument. When I came down she had put all the clean dishes I had done away but left her unclean mouldy ones on the side. I assume it's out of spite which hurts, but I am also reeling in a sense of guilt. Should I have just made more room in the fridge straight away and then made a comment about the dishes later? I feel like it wasn't really worth the hassle of the drama. On the other hand, I am slightly proud I stood up for myself.  &#x200B;  So Reddit, AITA?\n",
      "I was walking into a restaurant for lunch and held the door open for a small group of people behind me.

      "I (20f) have developed some fainting issues and weakness in my legs that makes it kinda difficult to get around without assistance. When it first started happening years ago, I was able to use crutches to keep me up right but then the fainting got worse so I had to rely mostly on a wheelchair to maintain my independence and to stay safe.  All that being said, I can and do still use my legs. My family lives in a two story house, so I use my chair on the 1st floor, but on the 2nd floor I usually stick to my crutches or walk on my own if I feel well enough. It’s not too bad bc the floor up here is carpeted anyway so it’s softer when I do fall lol.  My sister (17f) invited her friend Sarah (18f) over recently. I know her, we went to the same HS & have mutual friends, but we’re not close. Sarah came up the steps with my sister just as I was walking out of the bathroom, I waved to them both but Sarah gave me a weird look.  A few days after that, I was at this local froyo place with some friends. Sarah was there too. I ended up dropping my spoon on accident, so I asked her if she would grab me another one bc I didn’t want to wheel my way across the store. She rolled her eyes and said I needed to stop faking for sympathy bc she knew I was totally capable of getting it myself. Everyone looked at her like she’d lost it, but I just let it go and went to grab one. She stopped my chair with her foot and said I could walk to do it.  She was getting on my nerves, and my froyo was melting smh so I looked at her and said “I know it’s hard to wrap your mind around, but sometimes, disabled people can still use their legs for walking short distances. I can’t walk across this store without falling. So please stop being a d*** and move your foot.”  I finally got myself the spoon, and by the time I came back, Sarah was gone. One of our mutual friends said that Sarah just didn’t know why I use a wheelchair, and I didn’t have to be rude and embarrass her like that. A few other people agreed with them, but my best friend is on my side and she thinks Sarah absolutely had it coming bc of how she was acting to begin with.  My sister is kind of mad at me for ruining her friendship though bc now Sarah won’t talk to her. I just wanna know if I was TA here. I’ll definitely apologize if I was.\n",
      "Met this girl on tinder I'm M22, she's F20 and we hit it off and decided to meet for dinner last night at a restaurant she picked. The dinner was fine and she was cute but she came off as really dumb and naive, just like you're basic Western white girl (Ontario mans will get this one). Basically typically uninformed white girl and it was a turn off even though she was pretty, when the bill came I asked for it to be split and the look on her face was as if she was shocked. The bill was about $155, I had $90 cash to cover my end and tip and gave it to the server and said she'd get the rest and told her I had a good time but I wasn't really feeling anything and I ran off into the night.   Like 30 mins later I get texts from her calling me an ass for not paying for the whole thing as I was flaunting how much money I make to her (on track for 90k) even though I only mentioned it once after she asked. And she's in school and not working so hard for her to pay that. I just ignored the messages,  AITA?\n",
      "Title screams YTA or if I'm lucky ESH, I know....but please bare with me.  I (16M) was doing Chemistry homework for tomorrow and just revising this afternoon after school in peace, and my mum came in and asked what I was doing.  I told her what I was doing and she starts asking questions about how I find this subject. Then with each answer I give, she followed up with another question and another and another, until it somehow reaches to \"Do you take notes in Biology class when the revision video plays?\"  I was a little irritated by all this because I couldn't focus while my mum was right there practically interviewing me, and I cannot just ignore her like that. So I gave a reply to what she asked and then followed up in a polite manner \"....so can you please stop asking me these questions? I'm trying to focus on something important here if you wouldn't mind.\"  She got the wrong vibe from my message and just muttered \"You get irritated so easily.\" and walked off, leaving me guilty and not being able to study right because she shamed me.  Not the first time this happened. She always does this, but this is the first time I actually asked her to stop and because of her reaction, I feel kinda guilty and perhaps what I done was asshole-ish.  Was I wrong?\n",
      "I got my christmas bonus and she asked for a new coat. I asked how much it was and she said \"A bit over $100\". I said fine and waited for the cheque to hit my account.  Now that I've got it, she shows me the actual price, which is $190. Now my bonus isn't that much and I don't think I can spend that much money. So I explained to her \"I didn't realize that it was $190, I can chip in $100 if that's fine\" and she got angry at me. Then I got angry because in my mind $190 is $200 and we started arguing about the semantics. I said \"If you told me it was $200, I would've told you I couldn't afford that\", to which she said \"So now you're blaming me for not telling you the price correctly\".  I'm a bit stumped, Am I the asshole in this case???\n",
      "So I have really bad social anxiety and find it difficult to talk to people I don't know that we'll. My brother started dating a girl in January and I still haven't really said more than hi or how are you. I didn't really think it was much of a problem since she doesn't talk to me either but yesterday when she left after staying at our house for a week my brother called me an asshole for not speaking to her. The next time she came to our house she had dinner with our family and I tried really hard to speak to her but it just didn't happen. My brother got angry with me again and said that I was making her uncomfortable by being so quiet. I know they've been together for 6 months now but trying to talk to her doesn't seem to get any easier. Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to talk to my brothers girlfriend?  Edit: she has started a conversation with me before and I talked to her then but I don't think she likes me because we're completely different people but I'll keep trying to speak to her so she can feel at home when she comes to our house and so that it's less awkward in the future.\n",
      "My parents have always had a rough, codependent relationship, and so my relationship with my dad (61m) especially became rocky over the years. My mom (63f) died last year and it really wrecked my dad and we’ve been navigating our grief in different ways. My mom was a kind and generous person who, in spite of her marriage issues, always wanted me (38nb) and my disabled sister (34f) to have a peaceful and love-filled life. She always wanted to leave my dad, but he threatened her with financial baggage if she tried to get a divorce, and there were other narcissistic issues with my dad besides.   My mom had talked about how she wanted to leave me some money if she died, but no specifics about dad, just that it would go in a trust directly to me to avoid any “drama”.  So when mom died last year, my dad didn’t have any money set aside for the funeral costs or buying a grave/headstone. I have no clue if this chunk of money was meant for that kind of stuff, or if it was my mom’s way of kinda sticking it to my dad for all the abuse. I guess I’ll never know, but the trust in my name stuck with me.   Within a week of my mom’s funeral dad came to me all stressed out and talking about the money left in the trust, telling me that he needed some of it to pay for the costs of the funeral and other things around the house like repairs. He told me he had put money towards the original fund when he was younger, so he should have access to it now and that I should “do the right thing”.  Then when I expressed I was a little hesitant, because I could really use the money for my own life building (savings, debt), he got angry and said he would write me out of his will and he guessed I would “just get some money (from the trust) sooner than when he died”.  I told him I didn’t care about his will and that I was balancing my present needs with what mom had told me, but when he said he had paid towards this fund early in his career and life with mom, I thought I should relent, and give him around 25k, which was like half of the trust money. It’s more cash than I’d ever had in my life so the remainder is still very helpful, but it just felt wrong.   I didn’t do it, and now my dad won’t talk to me. It’s been a total stalemate with no talking to my dad for a full year now.  I feel like I might have been an asshole because he put money towards the trust thing in the first place. Ugh I just wish my mom would come back, and I could ask her more about what she wanted me and dad to do. I wish my dad would talk to me again. Thanks…AITA?\n",
      "Her lease is going up soon and the buyout for the car is a lot cheaper then it’s actual value (crazy covid prices)   She only has enough cash to be about 5k short. I told her I can loan her the 5k but I want my name on the title with her. (Car buyout is 13k. She needs a few thousand for emergency fund so she has to borrow some money, no point in getting a loan though)  AITA?\n",
      "I’m a year younger than my brother. It was your typical little brother big brother deal. However, we are both legal adults now and he still has teases and makes me the butt of the joke. Before moving forward I should mention that I have borderline autism, so I tend to have trouble telling what people are feeling. In the past he has begged me to play games I didn’t want to play, he would take my phone. He would even tell me to play with him when I was playing with friends. He makes his mission to get on my nerves but, if I get on his he explodes and tells me to stop. We have talks about this in the past and he has improved a bit over the years but it still feels like he sees me as a toy. Yesterday I called him, the conversation went like this: Me: hey Bro. Is this a bad time? Bro: No. what’s up? Me: so all the jokes you make about me, I know that’s how you show you love but, I don’t see it as love. Bro: look I have 28,000 different things to worry about right now. And I think you’re blowing this way out of proportion.  I hung up. He later texted me that he was sorry about it. But his next message said that he thinks that I’m overreacting and need to stop basing my self image of the feeling of others (which is fair cause I’m guilty of doing that). I responded with a text that went more in detail on my feelings. His rep once completely ignored the points I made about him and were more focused on a typo I made. I brought this up to him out of the blue, AITA.\n",
      "My (60M) daughter (22F) is marrying her fiancé who is 54. I believe he was her boss when she was working as a paralegal at his law firm, where he is a partner.   While I am happy for my daughter, this turn of events has put me back in contact with my ex of 10 years.   The first thing she does is text me a congratulations message about how our daughter is turning out exactly like someone raised by a \" horrible\" father like me and taunting me about if I'm disappointed that her husband makes more money than I ever will. Then all hell broke loose when her fiancé said that he and his family would strongly prefer if we stuck to the traditional wedding practice of my daughter being given away by her father.  My ex wife (61F) starts crying that she raised our daughter singlehandedly. I reminded her that I supported our daughter entirely when she quit her job claiming due to Stage 4 pelvic prolapse.   My ex wife has repeatedly tried to remove me from our group chat when we get into arguments and I have to be added back. The last straw happened this week. We were talking about attire because daughter is flirting with the idea of everybody on her small guest list wearing maroon dresses and ties.   My ex wife poked fun at me by saying that maroon was a \" slimming\" color. Obviously implying that I'm fat. When I retorted that a maroon dress wouldn't cover her trouble areas (including her persistent scowl) she removed me and went as far to create another group chat on the app without me.   My future son in law intervened and set up a conference call between the three of us. He said that if he witnesses any more discord from either of us, he will be marrying my daughter in a courthouse wedding after the holidays with neither of us in attendance. He said he doesn't care how we figure it out as long as the arguments end.  I realized I finally had enough of my ex wife and I cannot imagine myself spending 3 hours in her presence.  I called my daughter and told her that at this point, she had to choose. It was either her mom or me at her wedding. I told her I wanted to give her away and so did her fiancé and herself. But that if she didn't uninvite her mother, I couldn't be there to do that and she'd have to either get her mother to do it or another male relative if the groom's family objects.   My daughter starts crying and cursing the both of us. She says that her future mother in law was elderly and sick and she cannot believe that I'm threatening to make her disappoint a practically dying woman because of my ego.   AITA for this ultimatum? My ex wife instigates everything, yet I am blamed for reacting to it. Now my daughter is ranting that she's considering hurrying up the signing of her prenup and just doing a courthouse wedding. She blames me for that line of thinking.\n",
      "Hi, this post is going to be quick because this literally just happen, so quick context, I have Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety, an oral fixation thing that makes me constantly want to bite and suck on stuff [like hoodie strings and biting own finger nails] and a few other things that aren't necessarily relevant to this story, as well as the fact that im a minor and have anger issues and I take medications for my issues.  So just to clarify in this story Op is me, GM is My Grandmother, and M is Mother.  So it is about 7 here and M and GM were about to head to work, I was chewing on my hoodies string while saying goodbye to M. When I was asking her a question, GM reaching out to pull out the hoodie string from my mouth saying \"should I get you a pacifier?\" She says this was just a joke a few minutes later but it upsets me because she constantly tells me to stop chewing on my things [which I only chew on my stuff and its only ever my hoodie strings] I get upset and yell at her because I'm annoyed that she's said this, telling her to shut up because this is not the first time she's made a comment like this over the years saying stuff about how I should just take a pill and I'll be fine, stop asking when I'm excited about something and getting upset if i ask more than twice [can kinda understand this one but shes kinda rude about it], etc etc.  She tells me that I need to watch my mouth, I yell at her again \"shut up\" and I'm getting upset and am going to start crying because I don't know what to do and everything is stupid and M tells me to stop it and that I need to stop yelling, I got even more upset because she essentially just called me a baby and always says something like that when I chew on my hoodie strings I gesture at GM while staring at M but she says I \"have no reason to talk to her like that\" I say yes I do but she just scolds me again and I get really angry, I yell at them to fuck off and enter my room, they both tell me not to curse and GM said that this was the \"old op\" because I got upset more often. I tell her to fuck off and shut up again and I'm crying because M is taking GM's side again, no matter what she says or who starts it [most of the time its GM] and GM is being angry at me and without even missing a beat M heads out to work and GM does too but not before attempting to talk to me and scold me some more, I told her to just leave already, she tells me to shut my mouth and I yell that if she wants me to stop talking then why did she talk to me first, she says she didn't and I just to her to leave already and ignore her as she exits the house.  I don't know if I was necessarily the asshole here but I don't think I was?  So again AITA for yelling at her?\n",
      "Okay so I moved in with this girl and her best friend a couple years ago and they were into beach body, but because they were so nice, I didn't talk to them about it and just said I wasn't interested. The girl I already knew before moving in becomes a beach body coach, and things get stickier for because it was one thing when she was just doing their workouts, but now she is SELLING it and incessantly posts about it/replaces her vapid personality with a \"coach\" personality. We were quite close when we lived together, but it was hard to be her friend after I moved out because all of her social media was MLM pushing and while I never said anything negative to her, I started muting her stuff because we are in a PANDEMIC with people struggling to survive, I don't need to see a girl constantly tell me to \"have no excuses\" when she has no life problems and went from athletic at 130 pounds to lean at 120 pounds, and I have a completely different body and life. (This is not to mention I've done every fad diet and overcame an eating disorder. It is literally harmful for me to see this stuff). I start vocally speaking against MLMs in my stories because it's predatory and people should know why selling for them is toxic and nonsensical, but I even say in those that Beach Body isn't that bad because I know a lot of people who benefitted from it and I only threw that in to maintain a friendship. Fast forward a month or two and I make a vulnerable post about my weight gain and depression during lockdowns. One of her best friends she recruited as a \"coach\" under her TRIES TO RECRUIT ME TO HER \"TEAM\" BECAUSE I SAID I DON'T LIKE MY BODY DURING A PANDEMIC. At first I try to be diplomatic and just say \"I'm not interested,\" but then I decide I need to tell her how predatory and inappropriate that is on a post I made about body image. Cut to now and I see my ex-roommate at my voting place. When I try to wave to her, she completely ignores me, and I know she saw me because she is a very personable person and she walked RIGHT by me. I check Instagram, and she has made a huge post. It's a selfie of her holding all these MLM products being like \"I support 'network' businesses and if it's not your jam, that's okay, just don't tear down others.\" I check my followers list and she's GONE. No confrontation,  I just called out her inferior for gross behavior and she cut me off and made a passive post about it. Did I overreact, or is she in a cult and hated me for not enabling it? Idk.  &#x200B;  TL;DR My roommate became a beach body coach and drove me insane w her incessant posts, then cut me out completely because I told her underling off for trying to recruit me to her \"team\" for a post I made about body positivity during lockdowns\n",
      "So, here’s what happened. A week or two ago my gf of seven months dumped me. I was sad for a while and one day her friend told me that she regretted it and she felt so bad. This fire some reason made me feel better and thought that she deserved it. I never wanna make her like depressed or anything but I want her to regret letting me go because she just wanted someone else and meet new people.\n",
      "Back when I lived with my parents, I used to spend weekend nights watching Pokémon or playing games with my brother (I'm 27, he's 29). Thing is, he's always been entitled and never liked it when things didn't go his way. We also have conflicting views on things, so I'm always afraid to confide things to him (like, I'm trans and am yet to tell him).  Last January, I moved into my own apartment with my partner (both me and my partner are autistic btw). Since then, my brother has been constantly trying to ask me to visit \"home\". One time when my parents helped me and my partner move my partner's stuff from their abusive old landlord to my place, I was intending to go back to my old home, but refrained when my partner had a meltdown due to PTSD and I decided to make sure they were safe. My brother sent me an abusive text insulting me and my partner.  Then one time when we had laundry issues and I had to ask my parents' help again, my brother once again sent me a very abusive text because apparently I'd \"ruined things\" and he \"needed the laundry before work tomorrow\".  Earlier this month I finally visited home and was ready to do stuff with my brother, but he was angry when he found out I was only staying for the day and not for the night. I do feel asshole-ish for not staying the night when he wanted to do stuff with me, but I didn't feel comfortable given everything else I mentioned above. He called me a snake, a monster and how I've \"changed\". He then threatened to cut up my partner's clothes should my parents ever do their laundry again. (My brother has never approved of my partner, telling me they're not allowed in the family home, and can't ever visit for Christmas.)  This was the final straw. Afterwards, I decided I'm not going to do anything with him unless he realises how entitled and selfish he was behaving, especially after how he talks about my partner. However, last weekend my dad visited. He told me how my brother complains to him that I never talk or get in touch with him. I tried telling my dad my reasons, and my dad understood, but tries to tell me to \"at least send him a message\" or \"give him a call\". I'm especially worried about how I might look like the asshole if I come \"home\" for Christmas but don't do anything with him.  My dad's a great parent, but I'm not sure I can do this. And now I'm feeling a bit asshole-ish for not even telling my brother I wouldn't keep in touch. And my dad seems to think I should at least try to get along. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "So to start this off, I am 18 and they are all 17. The group is composed of me along with two other guys and one girl. I created a group chat with them about a month ago and I began to observe that I initiate contact most of the time. Also, when I do ask if anyone wants to hang out, I then usually have to wait all day for any replies and only get any after I say something about it. If I kept silent, I would not get any reply at all from anyone. I would just be ignored. This gave me the idea that there is not equal effort being put in here. I addressed the group about it, although I was less than nice. They said that they’re simply busy and that they’re not trying to ignore me. However, I didn’t believe them completely. I didn’t trust them. About a week later I asked again and asked if they were “busy” this time too. (Yes, I put it in quotes.) They said that they like hanging out with me though, and they were busy then too. They’re not trying to slight me or anything, they’re just busy. Important to note, I do believe that I have a lot more free time than them. Still though, don’t real friends make time for others? Shouldn’t they reach out without requiring input from me first? (Although, it is more than this group where I find my self initiating contact most of the time, even with closer friends.)  I still felt like there was a noticeable difference in effort put in. I still don’t get replies, I still don’t get asked to hang out. I texted the girl about this, trying to see if I was just being paranoid and need to put more trust in the group, or if my concerns are valid and this group isn’t worth my time. I also told her that I’m talking to just her about this because she’s a woman and women are supposed to be more open to talking about emotions or feelings or whatever. She didn’t take kindly to this and thought I was using her because of her gender. Was this misogynistic of me? She also thinks that I’m just full of self pity and I’m just complaining. I was doing what I’ve done a couple times before: seeking reassurance. She said that it’s fine at first but it gets tiring quickly.   Anyways, a little later I contacted one of the guys about a baseball game he told me about. Now, I turned them down at the initial date because there was something else I wanted to do. However, that date didn’t work out anyways so I told him to remind me when they go because I’d like to go with them. A couple days later, he asked the group if anyone wants to hang out. I turned them down because I wanted to fix an issue with my phone. They never mentioned the game however and apparently they spontaneously decided to go once they got together but they forgot all about me. Am I wrong for being angry that I was forgotten about, or should I have been more understanding since I turned them down twice before? I was less than nice when I confronted him about this, but should I be more forgiving because I turned them down and they didn’t even know they were doing it until they decided a while later to, after I said that I’m doing something else? Or am I right to be pissed that I was forgotten about?   Basically, are these friends worth apologizing to? Also, was I being paranoid for no reason over them potentially being fake friends?\n",
      "I(25M) grew up in a very tense and stressful environment. My parents were very old fashioned and still are. My younger brother(18M) is nonverbal. He's a such a sweet person and I only want the best for him. I raised my brother until I went off to college. My parents did the bare minimum such as buying clothes and cooking.   I moved out at 19 to attend college and moved in a cheap apartment. My parents decided that taking care of my brother was too much for them and moved him into the apartment without telling me. I did my best to make it work while in college, but my brother did not like being in a new environment.  After I graduated, I landed a job as a dispatcher for a government agency. One of my friends helped with taking care of my brother while I worked.   I got an offer recently that pays twice my salary in another state. I live in the colder environment and the location is down south. I did accept the position and found a better apartment. I know it would be too much for my brother to move to a new environment and I told him about the move. He was not thrilled with the news. I told my parents about the new job and location and that it would be best for brother to move in with them. They were not happy with the news and started accusing me of being a horrible brother. I told them that it was my decision and they did not have a say.   AITA for choosing a new job over taking care of my brother?\n",
      "Context:I (F20) and my best friend M(F19) have been friends for 3 years. She currently is seeing this guy L (M?). She met him online and he just gives me weird vibes. They are constantly on call and talking to each other. She hasn't told me much about him. Not even his age. But they went on a date and he got her a lot of stuff that's expensive. I'm pretty sure they've only know each other for a month or two. I'm scared he will do the overly affectionate, then ghost, then comeback thing. It would take a toll on her mental health, which already isn't good, if he did that and I don't want her to get her hopes up or get hurt.  Issue: She has told me before I am too brutally Honest. I don't want to hurt her or scare her about this guy. But I want to tell her that he just seems off. I have already asked her to be safe when around him, but it's still setting off alarm bells in my head. I don't know if I am overthinking it but he just seems weird. I don't know how to describe it and don't know how to tell her without upsetting her. WIBTA if I tell her , even if it upsets her? Or should I just keep quiet for now?\n",
      "I notice the dog yesterday because she couldn't fully close one of her eyes upon closer inspection the eye was bloodshot and throughout the day I saw her trying to scratch/itch her eye on the floor and blankets.

      "To start I am 32.... I went to my father's house with my kids (7 and 9) for thanksgiving diner, who lives about 130 miles away, shit got dramatic af, and I waited until my dad and stepmom went to sleep and just friggen left.   now for the long version.... I could max out the character limit by explaining how I don't get along with my step mother, but for my own reasons just go with \"stepmom bad, dad good... well dad someways bad.\" We have had pretty serious issues in the past but seeing as my mother died last year, and my children's mother is nonexistent in their life, I've been trying to look past our disagreements and accommodate my stepmother's \"issues\" so my children can have a relationship with a grandparent. It's difficult, to say the least, to deal with her, and I haven't visited or really talked to them since July 4th. I also got a puppy since then and herein lies the problem, basically she flipped out because her cat wouldn't come back inside because of the puppy. she yelled at me in front of my children telling me that \"the dog stays outside or in your car or you have to leave!\" then refined it to the dog stays in the car while I'm there. while she was ranting about some \"agreement\" that we never made, I calmly explained that I had no idea what she was talking about but i would try to find someone that could watch the puppy for now if it would help. i didn't do that. instead shortly after they went to bed I grabbed everything I brought got the kids in the car and drove all the way back home. currently I'm at home trying to thaw a turkey I bought at Walmart 3 hours ago, wondering if it was worth it to ditch my dad and brother with the formidable aftermath that will come over thanksgiving. also, I know I'm fine with just me and my kids for turkey but I know the kids were enjoying their time with grandpa and their step-cousin.\n",
      "I have a friend that I have been close with for over a decade. We have lots of great memories and fun times together. The problem is, he is super sensitive and doesn't like when people disagree with him. It can be over something as trivial as me not finding someone attractive that he thinks is attractive. He once blew up at me and told me I was crazy because I don't find a certain celebrity to be attractive and he does.   I spend a lot of time walking on eggshells around him for fear of pissing him off. Well, about a week and a half ago he brought up a topic that I feel very strongly about and that is false accusations. I told him that just because someone has been accused of something, it doesn't mean that they actually did it. Someone should be considered innocent until they are proven guilty. False accusations have destroyed lives in the past and have been used as manipulation tactics and I told him that I am not willing to label someone, throw heavy words around or defame someone's character based on the \"he said she said.\"  Well, it's been a week and a half and he is still giving me the silent treatment. We used to talk every single day, but now all I see him doing is trolling social media all day long spewing vitriol to people that don't adhere to the exact same views as he does. He literally tweets hundreds of times a day and most of it is angry, cancel culture-type shit. There have also been a couple of passive aggressive posts aimed at me, about how you can be friends with someone for a long time and how they can still \"disappoint you on basic rights and wrongs.\"  AITA for speaking my truth? I feel like I've ruined our friendship and that I just should have kept my mouth shut and continued to walk on eggshells and not voice a dissenting thought\n",
      "(Excuse my english I'm spanish so probably there will be some errors)  Hi, my name is Cesc.  So, my co-workers had the idea to give us each other presents for our birthday. These guys are very social and I'm kinda the introvert guy that feels uncomfortable with social events, specially when attending with not my friends (and my co-workers are just co-workers not really my friends). So, now it's been my birthday (34) and also one of my co-workers too. They want to do a meal so they can give the present to my co-worker, and probably to me too.  I did express at some times that I'm not the guy who usually likes social events at a point that sometimes I feel overwhelmed with the idea.*  I really feel is something silly but sincerely it affects me in a way I can't really understand.  AITA for not attending even if probably they are doing it for me?  * Note: I already went to a BBQ after just 3 weeks of being in the company and to a company celebration which was \"not mandatory\", after that I started to open myself about how I feel in those events.\n",
      "Throwaway bc my brother likes to go on reddit a lot. Also sorry for format im on mobile.  Over the weekend, my (27F) brother (29M) and his family came to visit my mom. Which includes his wife, Christina (30F) and their kids (10M, 7M, 2F). They were mainly going to spend the nights at Christina's grandmas house bc she has beef with my mom (58F) (her MIL) and they haven't spoken in years.  On the first night, I came home from work and my brother and my oldest nephew were there and we talked and played games and it was fun. My mom talked to my brother if he could help her out with her business tomorrow bc she's been drowning in work. My brother agreed. (This is important for later).  The following day, I wake up late spend some time with bro and go off to work. I get home and realize that the house is empty except for my mom. And then she tells me that she and my bro got into a fight. She had brought up my bro helping her again and he told her he didn't want to help after all. And she got mad. I dont really want to go into details but just picture the worst fight you could possibly get into with someone. It was a very very very bad fight.   The next 2 days I visit them at other locations bc they won't go to my moms house.  But on the last day, nephew 7M asks to see his other my mom so my brother brings him over and my mom got to spend time with her grandkids and my brother and my mom seemingly made up.  Except, for today when my SIL texted me and told me that my brother is very very very depressed, doesn't want to talk about what happened with my mom to her (bc of their history) and doesn't know what to do.  I dont know if telling her would make me an AH or if telling her would be going against my brothers wishes. But if it would help, maybe I should tell her.  TL;DR: mom and brother got into the fight of a century. Made up a few days later. Brother still depressed and doesn't want to tell his wife what happened. SIL is asking for details. Dont know if I would make things worse or better by saying anything\n",
      "Me, my mom, and my bro usually travel to the country my dad works at on our vacation time like Christmas or Holidays. So, we got an apartment with my mom's friend (Eve). I've been noticing that she is always following us wherever we go during \"family time\" and she would invite herself sometimes.   At first, I was fine with her tagging along, but it seems like we couldn't go anywhere or do anything without her coming with us. This became a normal pattern and I was already getting annoyed that she was always inviting herself when it's supposed to be family time and expects my parents to pay for everything ( fares, movie tickets, meals, etc..) when we are on a budget when we go out. I felt like she was being too clingy and was invading our private time that is rare.   My dad works for 5-6 days a week and does overtime at work so we rarely have time to spend with him. We only stay there for 1-2 months and only get to spend time with him on the weekends. My bro and I were getting tired of Eve trying to always tag along, so I purposefully arranged our family time like going to the movies during the time she has work on.  On my birthday, I specifically asked my parents to arrange a trip to a nearby country as I didn't want Eve to come with us. She doesn't have a visa and couldn't come with us, but my mom was making me feel guilty that I have been excluding her from our plans.  I really just want some family time (which we don't get a lot of) before I go to college without someone tagging along and ruining it. So, am I the asshole for trying to exclude her?\n",
      "AITA for thinking that going on a MULTI- family lake trip with kids shouldn't include bringing home 6 drunk strangers at 2am to the shared AirBNB.  Both families paid equal for the rental.  2 Families share a lake house. Family A comes with 9 people(kids + a friend). FAMILY B is supposed to come with 8 people.  Family B only shows up with 3 people because their kids bailed. Couple B  brings home 6 drunk strangers into a house of partly sleeping kids at 2am. The drunk visitors are loud,  beligerent, wake up kids, start going into rooms, where people are sleeping. Couple B wife passes out. Couple B husband won't end the party. Finally the strangers are asked to leave. They are beyond wasted, wet from swimming, dont have a car or sober person to drive. They set off the car alarm of Family A's car at 3:30am trying to get in it. But after 4 am 1 girl comes back and is pounding on the back door. Again waking up kids.   Family A talks the next morning and the kids don't feel comfortable to stay another night.  Kids range in age from 11-18  Family A leaves.  ARE WE A$$HOLES for not wanting drunk strangers in the house? Should we not have the right to be safe and sleep in a house we rented? Do you have different expectations for a family weekend vs an adult only get away? Should Family B have to give them a partial refund?\n",
      "Okay, so my brother was playing video games on his computer (He’s 14, idk if it matters). My dad had told him before to get off and work on school, and my brother says ‘in a few minutes’. 25 minutes later, he’s still not off, and my dad yells at him and threatens to unplug the computer. My brother says he’ll only be on for two more minutes and tries to explain, but my dad doesn’t listen and says he’s had enough time. Who’s in the wrong, I really want to solve this argument because they’re being VERY loud.  (Edit: pretend I’m my dad.)\n",
      "Some background on my situation:  I (21,F) am a college student living with two roommates, Hadley and Cam (fake names used for privacy) who I decided to move in with about a year ago as we all shared a friend group and got along well. We decided on rooms, moved in, and all was great.   Cam, at some point, decided to stay at her boyfriend’s home for a prolonged period of time. This wasn’t an issue; Hadley and I kept the home clean, shared food and supply expenses, and even though Cam wasn’t around— she still paid her rent and share of utilities.  Can and her boyfriend have recently decided to spend more time at our apartment. Since her return, a chore chart now humbly resides on our refrigerator (you are to initial and date a chart that displays some regular chores). I, however, have been spending more time at my own boyfriend’s home. I stop in every now-and-then to grab a change of clothes or to focus on some homework in my room. Even when home, though, I have not been regularly making a mess of any shared spaces. (There were a couple things out of place, Hadley texted me, I quickly tidied.) As such, the chore chart is not initialed under my name.   I can sense some growing tension toward myself and am genuinely confused. As of recently, a list under the chart for household supplies has been added. It reads: “If you can’t clean, at least buy supplies so somebody else can. This is your home.”  I haven’t been cleaning, yes— but I haven’t been creating any mess. I also haven’t been purchasing supplies— but I haven’t been using them.  I am genuinely confused as to if I am in the wrong here. AITA for not cleaning my apartment?  ((EDIT: I should clarify that Hadley had only texted me once letting me know that some of my cosmetics were on the counter; this was what I was referring to as “a couple things out of place”. I sorted them out within that day.))\n",
      "Hi I made another post regarding my son but another situation is being brought up and I am currently questioning my parenting style so here we go. I (35 F) have a (14M) son. Ever since my son turned 7 he had had severe seizures. Now that he is 14 his seizures have stopped happening very often but it’s possible he could have one at any point. We still go to the doctor often to have him checked. I am very scared of losing my son to seizures so I constantly make sure he is okay. Normally on the weekends my son wakes up around 9-9:40 Am. He has always been like this he’s never ever slept in late. On one Saturday morning I realized it was noon and my son was still not awake. This was very weird because like I said he is always awake around 9-9:30 am. I went upstairs and I knocked on his door. I always knock before entering for his own privacy. I never go into his room without permission. If I ever need to go into his room when he is not home I always send him a text asking if it’s fine. He usually says it’s fine but when he says no I don’t go in there. So after knocking on his door a few times I got no response. I thought the worst that he may be having another seizure and I panicked. I quickly opened the door expecting to see my son seizing. Luckily, he was perfectly fine. My son was in his bed on his phone watching TikTok. I sighed in relief and I heard him yell “WTF MOM” I apologized and explained that he didn’t responded and I was scared that he could be having another seizure. He said “I have not had a seizure in almost a year I’m fine. I’ll be fine. Also I don’t have to answer to you when you knock. I didn’t feel like it.” I explained that seizures could still happen. I apologized for entering his room and went out and I closed his door.  Later on my son came to me and said he will be locking his door from now on. I told him I would rather him not because I’m scared he will have a seizure and I would not be able to help him. He kept saying he won’t have anymore and that I won’t be allowed in his room anymore. He ended up telling my MIL the situation and I got a call from her saying I should respect my sons privacy. She also said that I am a big intruder. I did not mean to intrude on my son but I did fear the worst. If he wants to lock his door I will not stop him but AITA for barging in?  Edit: for some reason some of you guys think I’m barging into my sons room to catch him “in the act”. This makes me question if you even read my post. He has SEIZURES. I never barge into his room without knocking. He didn’t respond so I thought this could be happening. Normally if I knock he responds to me\n",
      "A week ago, my mom’s home phone stopped working and due to ‘rona, she couldn’t buy another one because she doesn’t like buying online. Because of the situation, she started borrowing from me and all 8 of my other siblings, because she doesn’t have her own cellphone. She could still see missed calls on the television, and so she called the missed calls from my phone and it was the high school counselor of my brother. The counselor was saying he isn’t going to be able to graduate, because of lack of credits, and currently failing all of his zoom classes too. my mom went to wake up my brother around noon, and he refused to take the phone from her and threw it on the ground, until she explained who it was, he finally picked it up. My mom comes down telling me what happened, so I confront him, and says, “I didn’t know it was yours” and “what are you going to do about it?” just to instigate, but I’m unsure if I can really blame him all that much tho, because I don’t really think he realized who it belonged too.\n",
      "I (29F) work on an office with Victoria (32F). I've been her boss for almost 5 years but we haven't worked very closely until September last year when I offered her a promotion, working immediately under me. That's when we started sharing an office. We have a great working relationship for most time.  However, one thing that I can't get past is the physical affection. She is a very touchy-feely kind of person, who will hug everyone, always touch people's arms or hair or face, or find one reason or another to touch someone. I am the complete opposite.   I have been gently trying to tell Victoria this. In the beginning, when she first started working with me, every time she tried to hug me I'd say \"oh, I'm not really a hugging person\". At the same time, I'm not an animal. If the situation warranted it (I.e. she was sad or it was her birthday or something) I did hug her. So I guess this blurred the lines and she thought she could just come and hug me whenever. This actually sounds really weird as I'm trying to type it but bear with me for a little longer.   The other day, it was a really bad day at work. I was having some major problems with some clients due to some of my employee's mistakes (one of them being Victoria). I was fuming and needed a few minutes by myself to calm down. I was in the office making a coffee when Victoria came in. I know she wanted to apologise but it was not the right time. I was honest and before she could say anything I told her \"I need a few minutes, please leave me alone. We will talk soon \". She sheepishly came closer and said \"hug?\" I replied \"not now, thank you\". She came closer again and said \"just a little hug\". I snapped and told her \"I said no! Get out please!\"   She left visibly upset. I drank my coffee and went looking for her. I found her by the kitchen, crying and being comforted by some of the other employees. They all gave me a weird look and scattered. I spoke to Victoria and apologised for my reaction. She smiled and said \"it's okay\", but I added that \"while I am sorry for my reaction and for hurting your feelings, I want to say that you made me uncomfortable when you insisted on a hug after I said no. I know you are a warm and friendly person but I need you to remember that we are in a working environment and when it comes to someone's personal space, \"no\" is a full sentence\" She didn't seem pleased with this and has been cold towards me for a few days.   I told this story to my friend and she said I was too harsh, especially as a boss. She thinks that if I work with people and have to manage them, I should learn to compromise.  So, Reddit, AITA?\n",
      "Now before I start I must say, I really don't care about that apology that much. I love my girlfriend more than anything so if she doesn't apologise I will keep going without saying anything.  Now what happened is this. My friends invited me to McDonald's and I said, sure why not. At the same time my girlfriend was also there and I really didn't know that she was there. She was with her parents. I didn't want to bother her while her family was there so I just ordered what I wanted and began eating. After like half an hour I noticed that they had left so I messaged to my girlfriend saying \"were you at McDonald's?\". Oh boy I shouldn't have done that. She started saying how she hated the feeling of being followed and she also said some other things but they are just the same thing without much change.  I explained that I wasn't following her and I also said that I just bumped her.  I sent her the messages my friends sent and while these things were happening I was quite angry. After like 20 minutes she said alright and I left her on read because I really didn't want to talk to her.   WIBTA if I expect some kind of apology?  Sorry for the bad English btw still learning.\n",
      "So, I am responsible for relieving our receptionist during her 15 minute breaks. There's always some flexibility for bathroom emergencies of course, but in general they are mid morning and mid afternoon, like any normal business practice.   Lately, she's taken to telling me when she'll want her breaks instead of going at the regularly scheduled times that have worked fine for the last 2 years. Sometimes less than an hour after arriving, sometimes less than an hour after returning from lunch.   I'm most busy during the end of my shift, and plan my work so that I begin the most labor and attention intensive task after her last break. This way I am able to work without interruption and have less risk of making errors which would affect several other departments and possibly cost me my job.   Today she requested her break 30 minutes before the end of her shift, meaning she'd only be back for 15 minutes before leaving for the day. I finally had enough and simply said, \"Sorry, I'm busy during that time. I'll come now if you want.\" She didn't accept that offer, and seemed fairly pissed off to be denied. I don't want to make our working relationship difficult but I don't want to get steamrolled either.   AITA?\n",
      "One of my best friends D (31F) and I (27F) have been waiting for a long time to schedule a beach getaway. We are both furloughed at the moment, but returning to work soon and wanted to take advantage of the time off and warm weather and started planning a trip.   When we were getting ready to book said trip, we happened to meet up with B (34F) at my best friends house. We all know each other from working together. Although we haven’t hung out much prior, we had such a great time together that we decided to invite her on our trip and make it a girls weekend. Shortly after we also invited our other friend N. B and N asked if they could each bring another friend (both of whom we’ve never met) and we agreed.   Before we departed, I made sure to inform everyone of the way I would like to structure the trip: D and I will purchase liquor and groceries for the group (open to anyone’s preferences) to be split evenly amongst the 6 of us. I also booked the resort on my card to be split 6 ways. Since we were all staying in this one room and there is an adjacent restaurant to the resort, I offered for all expenses from this restaurant to be charged to the room to split at the end of the trip and everyone agreed.   Throughout the experience B would be the only one to make small comments about finances throughout the weekend. I am very much not a “stingy” person and like to have my fun on vacation since I don’t do it that often. I also love treating my friends to food and experiences. Although I had opened the floor for objections to the group many times, she always went along with the plan yet seemed at least mildly dissatisfied with it. I shrugged it off to keep the good vibes flowing because everyone else was chilling.   Now, am I the asshole for being extremely offended when I finished my accounting at the end of the weekend and B started disputing a micro transaction of ~$17 (all because she and her friend decided to have a lunch separate from us 4 who had ours at the restaurant when we offered for them to join us) with me? My feelings are hurt because to me this is a negligible amount of money. I have no problem at all returning it to her and I did but she was so quick to jump in and tell me my math was wrong without offering any constructive solutions. I ended up taking this money out of my own pocket and paying back her and her friend but our friendship seems to be completely ruined. Throughout our heated discussion she also started throwing things like consoling me during a panic attack I had and how well she meshed with the group the whole time in my face while I was just trying to desperately explain my hurt feelings to her about specific things she had said. She then said I was being completely unfair and hurting HER feelings instead and I caused her so much sadness. I told her she should’ve just let me know she wanted to party on her own tab and taken the steps to do so herself. It was always an option.\n",
      "I was out of town visiting some friends. One of the friends I was visiting and I went to a nearby Ivy League college town for brunch.   After our sober brunch, she and I visited this cool bar/restaurant that she had wanted to show me. We sat at the bar. We chatted with the bartender a bit. My friend commented that she liked her pizza sweater, we talked about how the cool the bar was and the like for a couple of minutes. It seemed like she liked us. When she asked for our order, my friend ordered a beer. Then I ordered a vodka soda. I asked if it would be possible to make it a double.  She replied to me that they “*technically* we can’t make double drinks”. I was a little unsure why she said “technically”. I asked her, somewhat jokingly.. expecting to get rejected… if it would be possible to order a shot of a vodka AND a vodka soda with a little less mixer. (It was clear I was ordering this way to avoid it from technically being a double… but I could pour the shot into the mixed drink to make one). I’ve had bartenders tell me to order essentially the same from them when I would try to order a double from them at a major sporting arena.  After my question, she does not respond, but instead turns around and gets our order. She fulfills my request, but she’s pretty *ice cold* from that point forward. She doesn’t speak to us anymore and appears to avoid us.  Eventually, like 10 minutes later, my friend notices that the other bartender was working the last time my friend was there around 9 months ago.. and it was his first day bartending that day. We get his attention eventually and bring this up and start chatting. We were getting along well. It seems like he appreciated the conversation as he told us it was really slow in there and that they were really bored. Ironically, the drink I order from him seemed… really stiff.  Eventually the original bartender comes back later and warms up to us but there still seemed to be some awkwardness between us.  Was I an asshole for trying to order the drink the way I did?\n",
      "Me and my previous partner split at the start of January this year, a couple of days prior to seperating I covered a vet bill for her and loaned her some money putting me out around $2500. After breaking up I had no intention of requesting the money back, but she offered to cover the cost of mailing my posessions back to me as compensation, or a thank you, whatever you'd like to label it.  Over the course of the next nine months I've given her gentle reminders every now and then, she's given me \"It will be posted by X date\" and those dates have come and gone without any communication on her part, it culminating in last week me dropping her another reminder her but letting her know it was getting serious at this point and I was losing my patience with the situation (If it has any relevance, the possessions in question are of some sentimental value, family heirlooms, parents wedding rings, grandfathers ashes and what not). It's worth mentioning at this point that the primary reason she repeatedly failed to send it was being unable to afford the cost of mailing them, this was at the same time that she would be constantly telling me about the concert she was attending, the new game she'd just bought, the custom artwork she'd just had commissioned.  Once again she assured me it would be posted come Friday 29th September. Friday came and went, no contact from her no reply to my queries, the weekend came again nothing, monday I finally reached out and explicitly stated how frustrated I was that she had once again not sent my items nor contacted me to communicate anything, that at this point I felt my patience had run its course and that if I didn't have proof my stuff had been mailed come Friday 4th October I would be contacting the local police to report theft, at this point I felt I had no other choice to get what was mine back.  She finally sent some of the things (one box out of 6) as well as a short essay essentially summarised as; She doesn't appreciate being threatened and man handled, that if I was mature adult I would have taken a different route, that I had put her in a shitty situation where she couldn't feed herself because I was accusing her of being a manipulative bitch, that it was my fault for digging at her by reminding her that these items were of great sentimental value and finally attached to the end was a bill for the cost of shipping my items.  AITA here? Her statement definitely seems to make me out to be a shit head but I feel like, I handled the situation fairly reasonably, nine months seems more than a fair amount of time to start sending the items.\n",
      "So for context me (19 M) and my ex (20 M) have been broken up for about 4 months now. It didn’t really end well and have only been in contact for brief moments.   Regardless, last time we messaged was about a week ago supposed to be the cut off. Where it would be the final to we would meet up, give back our stuff and move on. I’ve since then blocked him and deleted his number but only realised now that he still has something of sentimental value.  It was a silly DIY shirt me and my friend made together. That friend is now dead and that shirt really does mean a lot to me. Like i can live without it, but something like that hurts to lose. I don’t have ways to come into contact with him as he blocked me on social media, he’s moved houses and i’ve lost his number. However, I still do have both his parents and his sisters contact numbers.  I have previously messaged his family before to ask them to tell him to give me my stuff back, which was what we did last week. I did things poorly on my half and was somewhat bitter towards the family even if they had nothing by to do with the ending of me and my ex’s relationship.  It’s the last thing from my knowledge of my stuff that he still has so WIBTA if I went back to my ex’s family to ask for my shirt back?   One thing to keep in mind as well, me and my ex (while i don’t know where he lives anymore), we are situated approximately about 2 hours from each other. So if this exchange were to happen again, this would be a whole day trip.\n",
      "My (32M) wife (32F) and I were watching The Office together. There’s an episode where Jim has to pick either a redheaded or brunette woman  for a bachelor party (his own girlfriend is brunette but he picks blonde instead) My brunette wife turned to me and said, “would you pick brown?” I just laughed because I thought she was joking. She asked again in a serious tone and I said, “are you serious? Why would the hair color matter?” She replied angrily that if I wouldn’t pick a brunette, that must means I don’t find her and her hair attractive and stormed off. I thought it was a joke but I texted my friend and he said I was an asshole for not just gushing to her about how I love brunettes after she asked, because apparently that was what she probably wanted to hear. AITA?\n",
      "My (22f) dad told me a few weeks ago that we were going to have to cancel Christmas this year because he couldn't afford it this year. He's switched jobs recently and isn't in the best place financially. I told him I would handle the dinner and everything so he wouldn't have to worry about it and to just do what he could. I was under the impression that he had already purchased presents for my younger siblings/ niece and nephew, all who are pretty young, or at least had a plan to get them something. But instead he told me that he couldn't afford that either, which again I understood. I spent all of the money I had to buy presents for the kids so they would have something to open on Christmas. I went to his house this evening to drop off the presents along with the tree/ decorations I got since he had nothing. When I walked in he was in his room setting up a ps5, I was obviously confused when I saw this. He apparently had just bought it and was very excited to show it off. I got into an argument with him about how he had told me he had absolutely no money for Christmas, but he had the money to buy himself a ps5. I told him that he was a bad parent and that he is selfish and childish and a bunch of other colorful words. He told me that I am a child and he can do what he wants with his money. So AITA for calling him a bad parent?  ETA  He is now saying that he didn't need to get them gifts because he bought one of my brothers a pair of shoes a few weeks ago, my sister is too old for gifts (she's 15), and he made no mention of the other three.  The kids in are ages 15, 12, 10, 6, 3, and 2. Me and my brother (24) don't care about him not getting us anything, I haven't received Christmas or birthday present since I was 14, but the younger kids deserve a better Christmas then just what I can provide.  Edit 2 To answer a few questions. I am 1 of 11 kids technically. The oldest 3 (28f, 27m, and 27m) are no longer in contact with my family, then my brother 24m, then me, and then the other 6 little kids. The oldest 3 have one mom, then my brother, me, and the 15 year old have the same mom, the 12, 10 and 6 year old have the same mom, and the 3 and 2 have the same mom. All the same dad. My brother 24 and I live together, and 15 lives with us part time, 12, 10 and 6 live with their mom (she doesn't celebrate Christmas) but my dad gets them on the weekends and the little ones live with him full time. My dad is 45 I believe, so he had my oldest sister at 17.   I haven't said anything to my grandpa, but I did vent to my grandma on my mom's side and found out some fun information. So a bit of backstory, my dad and mom divorced when I was 7, and my dad left. My mom got super neglectful/ abusive over the next 2 or so years to the point that we were removed from the home by DSS. We ended up moving in with my dad after a week. Come to find out from my grandma, my dad didn't want to take custody of us and was fully prepared to let us go to foster care. But my grandpa, my dad's dad, told my dad that if he took us in that my grandpa would help him out with whatever he needed until the 3 of us turn 18. And that is the reason my grandpa handles all the bills and gives my dad money. So that's just icing on the cake of him being a bad parent.\n",
      "I (21F) love my mother (50F). She works hard and she’s a first gen college student that graduated from Wharton. My problem is that she treats our relationship like…..a business negotiation. There’s always “fine print” to her help.  For context, I’m a college student and I’m a Black girl. I’m getting ready for my senior year, and for BW, hair is a monthly expense. I was handling my back to school shopping on my own because I didn’t want to deal with my mothers ways, but she INSISTED she’d help her daughter w school expenses and specifically, my hair. I reluctantly accepted her help.  I wanted a wig for school because it’s the cheapest and most convenient option long term. Also looks nice.   Box Braids can cost $150-$300 and last up to a month and a half (usually less).   If I choose to do them myself, $40 but they only last a month AND I need at least 2 days to do them (and I dont have time for that because I’m doing a clinical internship + school)  a silk press (professionally straitened hair) costs $50-$100 but only lasts 2 weeks. I, however, haven’t gotten my hair straightened in 3 years because it damages my curls and I always sweat it out fast. It’s a waste of money and I haven’t straightened my hair since.  last option is natural hair, but the products add up since I go through them fast ($100/3 weeks). Also, the maintenance takes a while (1 hour to wash, one hour to braid, 30+ mins to gel, 15 min/day to put in puff)  The wig I want is $248 that I pay once, but the wig lasts 2+ years if I take good care of it. All I have to do is cornrow my hair every 3 weeks and lay the wig in the morning. (Plus wash my braids every 4-5 days).   With all that said, today is the 17th and I leave the 27th for school. The wig takes 3-7 business days to ship so I need to order it tomorrow at the latest. I showed my mom the wig around 5pm, she agreed to pay half ($124). I said thank you and asked her to cashapp me so I could order it. She said “I’ll get back to you”. 30 minutes later she said she was about to go to the store and I asked again if she would send the money so I could order the wig and be done. She then lists a bunch of excuses as to why she changes her mind (a.k.a the fine print).  “I didn’t agree to anything! I said I would help with YOU’RE hair I want you to get it straightened it’s been years!! I don’t want to help if you won’t be flexible!”   My mother has tried to get me to straighten my hair for years and always calls it nappy. She’s been doing inconsistent stuff like this for years and  I was fed up. I never wanted to deal with her in the first place because of this. I told her I never want her “help” again because she’s unreliable and immature, and that if she’s offering to help someone she shouldn’t flip flop and add last minute clauses. She was offended.  I can afford the wig on my own, I’m just frustrated and disappointed. I’ve been trying to save 2k for school before I leave because I won’t be a paid intern until sept 22. I’m about 85% to my goal and I get 2 more paychecks from my other job before I move in.  AITA??\n",
      "Pretty much all that's said in the title. My cousin's landlord apparently tried a move on her and now she's uncomfortable living there so she's been looking for another apartment. I currently rent out two apartments. The one I share with my girlfriend and the other was my old apartment which has turned into my chill spot. Admittedly I don't use it often unless I have a lot of work to do or a couple friends are in town but I still need it for the storage space. My mother basically suggested the place to my aunt who asked me to let her stay there. Even though she'll foot the bills and rent, I don't like at all. She's pretty spoilt and annoying so I just avoid her at all costs. Plus I don't trust her enough not to fuck around with my shit that's still there (half of the furniture is mine) so I said no and left it there. Now my cousin has been messaging me non stop calling me an asshole for disregarding her safety and just not caring about her. She's even roped in my other cousins. Which leaves me here, AITA?\n",
      "I recently worked the usher shift and my theater job. Part of the job includes checking people’s bags, as that’s part of protocol. It’s both for theater guests and employee safety. Things we are concerned about are glass (broken glass hazard, alcohol(we serve it and want to make sure people have their consumption limited), and weapon (obvious reasons). Usually when people approach the usher stand I welcome them, tear their tickets, and if bags are present try to politely ask to look inside. I usually say “and I just need to perform a quick bag check, ma’am ”. I’ve been told this makes it sound routine. I look inside and look for any items of concern. Well this lady comes up and I welcome her, and tear her ticket. I see she has bags and say “ma’am I just need to perform a quick bag check. I value people’s time and try to make it quick while still being thorough. Well as she starts to open the bag she remarks, “do I need to give a finger print too?”. I immediately think, “oh great here we go...”. Anyway I look inside and ask to see her other bag. As I look in the other one she also remarks “I am fed up with you people and your service. I’m never coming here again. I just want to move her along so I don’t bother replying to her complaints but am thinking “fuck this lady, what happened to her?!.” I would of explained why we do it, but she seemed insulted and probably would get more annoyed. She storms past me and in a angry offended tone says , “and it’s please, not ma’am!” (From what I recall). I should mention that. I also am still holding her torn ticket which I didn’t get a chance to hand back to her since she stormed past me but told her that she would need the ticket. She snatched it from my hand and continued to storm off. I kinda just thought “ok... whatever” since there are customers who get pissed for whatever reason. But I can’t figure out what exactly I should of done differently? Saying please for a bag check sounds awkward and not direct. Also she was the only one who had an issue with it and everyone else complied and didn’t make a fuss. Am I an ass? Should I take another approach? Was she the ass? We’re both of us an ass? Was no one an ass? My co workers couldn’t remember any lady being annoyed at them so I’m curious what you all think.  Edit: My AITA concern is whether I should rethink how I tell people I need to perform bag checks. Should I add “please” somewhere like that lady brought up? Something about saying it sounds like being pushover not being authoritative. Let’s hear your thoughts.\n",
      "Lets start this off with some context. Me and all my friends are all pretty conservative. We like to talk about guns and everything that comes with them. This kid is highly liberal, however we tolerate it because you should be exposed to different political opinions, right? Anyway, my tables interests also include video games and wrestling(it’s big at my school) while his only interests are fortnite and basketball, which I don’t hate him for, typical teenager stuff right there. Anyway one day I was talking to one of my friends about Doom Eternal and he starts trying to interrupt me and tell everyone about his fortnite wins. I told him “shut up, wait your turn to speak”. I instantly felt bad, but he got really angry saying he was going to “knock me up” and stuff like that. The next day I was relieved as he no longer sat by us, however I felt bad for making him leave. From that you may think I’m the asshole, however the story gets more intense. A day later, he told all the black kids(my schools about 30% black, 70% everything else) that I had called him a ni***r, which, no I did not. Racial slurs are not to be messed with and no way would I call him that because of anger. All of the kids he told wanted to beat me up, however my table was able to diffuse the situation and tell them that the kid lied. Everyone at the table was outraged at him, and he no longer sits by us. So AITA?  (Edit:Grammar)\n",
      "Girlfriend has an important university exam in a few days.  She hates it when someone is late. Due to the snowy conditions we talked about leaving on  Wednesday or Thursday  for her finals.  At 10:30 AM on  Tuesday , she calls me to tell me that we should leave  today  because her father told her the road conditions were going to get worse on Wednesday. OK, let me get out of bed and see what's up and I'll call you back.   So I called her at 11 AM and said:   Me: The conditions are better. We can leave today.  Her: But we have to leave at 12PM or 1PM.  Me: It'll be hard for me to get ready by then. I didn't expect to leave today. Let's go at 2PM!  Her: No. My father will be mad at me.  Me: Why would he be mad at you?  Her: He said it's going to get too dark on the road if we leave at 2PM.  Me: OK, let's do 1PM then.   At 12:30 PM, I realized I won't be able to get ready by 1PM. So I called her to tell her I'd be ready at 1:30PM at the earliest.    Her: Why won't you be ready? You said you would be!    Me: You know I've got to get the food ready, a lot of clothes, the bread machine, meds, etc. I didn't expect to travel today and it's taking me longer than I expected.   (I have Crohn's disease and on a very strict diet so I have to prepare everything before we leave. Travelling is a bitch.)   Her: Ok, I'm going then.    Me: What?    Her: I'm going. You know how important time is to me and how stressed I am while studying for my finals.    Me: Would an hour really make a difference?    Her: Yes.    Me: So you're willing to go by yourself there for a whole week instead of waiting an hour for me?    I don't even remember her reply, except that she reaffirmed that she's going.    Me: Alright then.    I got pretty mad after this so I called her again:    Me: If you want to be with me and be my wife in the future you'll listen to me, not your father. You're 24.    Her: Whatever, I'm going now.   *hangs up*  At this point I'm both sad and mad and spent most of the next 10 minutes staring at a wall.   She calls me 15-20 minutes later and says:    Her: Will you be ready with everything at exactly 1:30PM?    Me: No. I thought you already left, so I stopped packing. I can be ready at 2PM.    Her: Then I'm leaving by myself.    Me: Alright.   All I did after this was text her to ask her if she got there safely and if the conditions were ok. She replied with  \"Yes, I Just arrived, it was ok.\"  and that was that.   Normally, my girlfriend bombards me with 10 phone calls a day but we've been silent for 3 days now.   I want to call her and hear her voice, but I think I already know what will happen. She'll blame me and say we aren't meant for eachother (?) while I'll make futile attempts to find a middle ground akin to  \"Yeah, I should have gotten ready in time, but I didn't and I'm sorry. At the same time, you could have waited an hour for me instead of storming off without me.\"    So, Reddit, Am I The Asshole for not calling and apologizing?\n",
      "For clarification, the friend in question will be referred to as B, one of our mutuals will be referred to as N, and my boyfriend will be referred to as C.  B and I have been friends since the 7th grade. We’ve had our ups and downs, brief periods of not talking, and we’ve been in a pretty comfortable spot lately. However I’m noticing a pattern with her and it’s worrying.   She and I have our own separate issues, as all people do, but she’s been projecting them very heavily lately. In one instance, where B, N and I were all driving to get dinner, she started blasting music and being very loud. As a night driver, I’m already very nervous, but the noise started to make me lose focus and we ended up getting lost. At which point I turned down her music (she had the aux cord at the time) and told her to stop yelling, at least until I figured out where I was.  B proceeded to get very quiet and later told me she hit her knees together very hard for the duration of the car ride.   Just recently, I drove 4+ total hours to drive to a restaurant that I enjoy very deeply with my boyfriend, C. On the way home, she asked if I could pick her up from her house and we could hang out with N. I agreed, and when I showed up she asked to play more of her music. I said no, because I was already very tired and just wanted to go to N’s house, to which she says, “It was your choice to drive to Town. I’ve been up since 4:30.” I said okay, that’s fair, but I still really didn’t want to listen to her music. I just wanted to play my music quietly for the 8 minute drive. I explained to her that because I was tired I was already very fragile, and although she’s someone who just tends to pick on people lightheartedly, I wasn’t sure if I could handle it at that moment. B responds, “that’s just how I am though. You’re fine.”   N and I have been talking about it recently. Supposedly B has been getting very lax with boundaries between N and her boyfriend and it’s making N uncomfortable; and on the topic of boyfriends, B is very mean to C. It’s alright if she doesn’t like him, but she is very openly mean to him even though I’ve expressed to her my long-term feelings for him.  The reason why I’m asking if I WBTA is because of our history. As aforementioned, we’ve had a very bumpy history, particularly on my end. There was a period of time where I was absolutely not a good friend to B. I took advantage of her and her mother’s willingness to take me on trips with them and pay for everything due to my home situation. Now that I have a car and a job, I give back to her as much as I can and try not to ask for anything in return. However, I feel like if I do confront her about it, I’d be overreacting because of how I treated her previously. I’m stuck and I’m not sure what to do.\n",
      "Okay, so for some background I've had my car for almost a year and it has yet to be put into my name. It is in my step mom's name.   My stepmother has a rule that until the car is in my name that my fiance can't drive it, but I've had the car for almost a year and I feel like they don't want to put it in my name. At the same time though, they say it's not their main priority because of Covid-19 and j understand that but even before it got bad here they wouldn't do it even though I stated that I would pay the fees.  Now we have been in hard times trying to find a place of our own as my sister wants us out of her house. So to save on gas I've let him drop me off and drive to work in my car. Well, my stepmom doesn't like that at all and I snapped at my dad about it. Because it's been almost a year and it's still not in my name   So AITA for continuing to let him drive it despite the rule my stepmother put in place.\n",
      "Throwaway Account  Okay, I'll be the first to admit that I can let my emotions get the better of me and I know it's not my sister's fault, but this is all still so raw for me.  I (22f) recently lost my paternal grandma and I'm heartbroken. The first eight years of my life she was my primary caregiver because my parents both worked full time and we had a special bond. During summer I had hadn't washed my hands properly and accidentally stained one of her books she had. It was part of a collection that she had started when she was a little girl and I got really scared. I cried, thinking my grandmother would hate me, and hid the book. When my parents picked me up I told them what I had done and they said that they would handle it. Later they sat me and my sister (18f) down and told us that grandma decided that she didn't want to be a grandparent anymore and not be apart of our lives.  I thought my grandma was angry about the book and hated me. I was devastated and cried hard and begged my parents to let me see her and apologize. They wouldn't do that and told me it would get better in the future and that I still had my maternal grandma, but it wasn't the same. We moved away not too long after that and I spent the rest of my formatives years worrying that if I ever made a mistake people would stop loving me. As a teen I wanted to reach out to her again but my parents either tried to persuade me not to or said that they would pass the message along for me, but got no response.  Now I know that my parents are the biggest liars on the planet. Turns out that my mom cheated and my sister wasn't my dad's bio kid. In the beginning my dad was going to leave them both but decided to stick it out, my grandma wasn't happy but supported his choice to stay with my mom and would babysit my sister too, but she did not want to take a Grandmotherly role in her life. Eventually, my parents gave her an ultimatum either she be a grandmother to my sister too, and love us equally, or she'd never see me again. My grandma called their bluff and they followed through. All this time I thought my grandma didn't love me anymore and that I was the cause of it but it had nothing to do with me. I was furious and moved out a few days later.  I finally reached out to her myself and by then she was sick and died a few months later. I'm glad that we were able to spend some time together and was surprised that she left me some money. Like pay off all my Student Loans, buy a decently used car and still have some later over. My parents found out and they want me to share it with my sister. I was upset by this and reminded them of the damage they caused me and the years I lost with my grandma, and that the money doesn't make up for it. I told them that just because they put themselves and my sister before me doesn't mean I have to put them before me too and wasn't going to give her a cent. My parents are calling me petty and selfish but given the circumstances it's falling on deaf ears but on the off chance, AITA?  Edit: Sorry spelling errors.  Edit 2: Okay just wanted to add in more information because I keep seeing the same question/comments   This isn't about punishing my sister. I know she's innocent in this and that my mom deserves the majority of the blame. I don't want to share the money because my parents showed no remorse for what they did to me and demanded that I share.  Yes my sister knows that another man is her bio dad. He and his mother are still alive, so if my sister wanted to, she could have a loving relationship with two grandmothers while I mine is still dead. It basically salt in the wound right now.  The affair was discovered before my sister was born so my grandma didn't just one day stop loving my sister like a granddaughter, she never had that bond in the first place.  One of the things my grandma and I talked about was her reluctancy to view my sister as her granddaughter. Her reasoning was that she didn't want to get too attached on the off chance that things went wrong. She did not think my parents' marriage would last and that's why she called their bluff.  For years my grandmother tried to reach out to see me but my parents refused. It was one of the reasons why we moved, so she couldn't find us or send me letters.   Edit 3:   Also, again, I told my parents about the book so they knew that I thought my grandma hated me over it and had no problem letting me live on like that.  My sister was around 4 when we stopped seeing my grandma so she doesn't really remember her and I honestly think she doesn't care about the relationship. Especially since she's closer to our maternal grandmother.\n",
      "I’ve (24F) been friends with this my friend (25F) for almost ten years.  My friend is great: she’s loyal, really friendly, you can always count on her to be there for you, but I’ve found that it’s hard to do the same for her because she, accidentally, demands too much. She goes through “cycles” in which she becomes super affectionate with a single person or a group of people and latches upon them until burning out the friendship.   Anyway, I guess this all started three months ago when she made a huge mistake and her landlord and housemates kicked her out of her apartment. She was, and continues to be, working with a friend of hers that has his own business, so she called him when it happened, and he helped her moved temporarily into his house.  Here’s where I accidentally come in. In my country it’s not uncommon to leave your parents until you’re in your late 20s or getting married. People leave when they have financial security, or they make some other investments like getting a car. That is to say, I’m still living with my parents. I pay the bills and groceries, so it’s similar to a rent, but honestly I haven’t moved because I want to buy a car because public transport is pretty bad and the city is terribly planned.   Well, about two weeks ago my friend was telling me that she was looking for a place. I though that this was sensible since I would be a bit peeved if she moved into my parent’s house out of nowhere, so I understood why her friend was frosty with her, but I also understood her situation. At one point I said something expressing wishful thinking, not “I want to be your roommate”. I even told her my plans. All she heard was that I wanted to be roommates, and honestly yes, she had me thinking but ultimately I decided against it.  This all changed when we met for a third friend’s bday dinner. She asked me to pick her up, and I said yes, but as the hour approached I was still working, so I let them both know that I was going to be late, and even though I didn’t say it, I expected my potential roomie to be able to find transport, instead she sent me angry texts.  I did end up going, but I was expectedly late. After the dinner my friend expected me to take her to her business parter’s home, and that was then that I realised that it was on the other extreme of the city from my house, but since it was 2am I drove her. In the drive she began telling me to live with her, but I shut it down reminding her of my plans. That was the apparent end of that topic, but a few days later she kept sending me apartments she found, and trying to schedule time for us to meet, but always wanted me to drive to her side of the city, so I keep declining.  She keeps calling which is really annoying when I’ve told her several times no.  So AITA for choosing to save for car instead of leaving my parents’ house to help an unhoused friend find a home and avoiding said friend?\n",
      "My boyfriend has a startup company that is working out of an extra bedroom in apartment.  It's been just him and his cousin doing most of the work until the past year or so when they have started to out-source specialty work (product design, marketing, representatives.). They hired a virtual assistant to help them with customer service, merchant orders, and some light social media work.  This current assistant is not working as much or as effectively as they want and they are seeking to hire a new assistant to work in-house.  They looked into interns from a local college, made posts on craigslist, indeed and have had some interest but no one is qualified enough yet not demanding too steep of compensation (they are a startup and are tight on budget.).   My boyfriend also made a post on his personal facebook for this assistant position and had a decent amount of interest.  He decides to pursue a girl from that FB post that also happens to be an ex-girlfriend (nearly all of the interest in the position was from ex-girlfriends.). This particular girl was with him right before we got together (have been together for 3 years now.)  &#x200B;  I want to outline the relationship they had for context as to why I am in opposition to this potential employee.   - They met in the music \"scene\" of our city and were party partners  - They had a very abusive relationship towards drugs with many all-night binges  - She kept pursuing him after we were officially together with chain-calling/texting  - He had told me how she was always sick with headaches  &#x200B;  She is supposedly now a different person and has a boyfriend, is going to college, meets their qualifications for the job, and is willing to be paid under the table and cheaply.  I am all for people changing and don't doubt that she is capable of doing this job but I also have requested that they look for other options as I am not comfortable with her being in our apartment working with them.  He says she is the only person that they have been able to find and how difficult it is to find someone.  I'm currently not budging on my stance that I would not like them to hire her and seek someone else.  Please advise if I am being unreasonable.\n",
      "I'm the oldest of 12. I think my parents are amazing parents and all of my siblings are great kids/young adults except for Kylie (17).  Kylie has ADHD and went to therapy and was medicated when she was younger but she recently stopped taking her meds or going to therapy because she thinks there's nothing wrong with her. She has gotten caught smoking, drinking, sneaking out, and has ditched so many times that she might not graduate in time.  She's also been making our siblings' lives hell. It got to the point where one of my sisters (9) called me to ask if she could live with me because Kylie was too mean. I told our parents about it and they admitted that they needed help but didn't know what to do so I offered for Kylie to stay with me.  Kylie was very excited to get away from my parents and siblings until I told her the rules she will have to follow when living with me and my kids. They are   She is responsible for keeping her room and bathroom clean. I do room checks every Sunday and if they are not clean, she doesn't get her electronics until they are.  In addition to cleaning her room and bathroom, I expect her to sweep and mop once a week and make dinner once a week.  She has a 7 o clock curfew on school days and 9 o clock curfew on weekends, but she has to ask me before going anywhere and she has a tracker on her phone  She loses her electronics, except for her school laptop, at 9 every morning and does not get them back until she's done with all of her schoolwork and her chores.  She will do her schoolwork (she does independent study classes) from my office so I can keep an eye on her and make sure she's doing her work.  If she is failing a class, she does not get to go out and only gets 30 minutes of screen time a day until she gets her grades up.  She will go to therapy and take her medication while she's living in my house.  I will not give her money for anything. She can babysit my kids (8 and 10), do extra chores, or get a part time job (curfew is flexible if it's for work) if she wants extra money.   She and I get into a lot of arguments but she's actually doing very well. She even got her first A last week.  My parents are a little upset that I've been so strict with Kylie but they understand that in this situation, it is necessary because nothing else worked.  We were at a party with my husband's side of the family and Kylie wasn't allowed to use her electronics that night. She asked my MIL to borrow her iPad and talked to her friends until I found her and took the iPad.  Kylie hadn't logged out of the social medias and my MIL saw her DM's. Apparently Kylie said some pretty nasty things about me and told her friend all of the rules she has to follow. My MIL called me that night and told me off for being so strict with Kylie and said that she was being a \"normal teenager\". She went so far as to say that if I treated my kids like this when they're older, she will call CPS on me.  AITA for being too strict with my sister?\n",
      "My friend is know to get herself in situations with guys. She tends to lead them on and act like she likes them just to dump them later, or finally realize that they suck. I've been supportive about whatever she's doing with her life but it gets on my nerves sometimes. Anytime she runs into any trouble she comes to me for advice and such. Today she sent messages of a guy asking her if she could call later to a group chat, asking for help. This wouldn't have made me annoyed if she hadn't interrupted the conversation. So I responded saying that the message had nothing to do with the conversation and she just sent the same message again, asking for help. So I pretty much told her that she kept getting herself into situation and that she needs to deal with her own shit. She then told me that it was just and random guy that dmed her and to \"take that stick out of your ass.\" I told her that she didn't need help and that she could've just blocked him without coming to us.  Do you think I overreacted?\n",
      "Am I (22F) the asshole for not wanting to hug my mother (55F) ?  So this is my first post on reddit, it's probably going to be a little long. Also this is not my first language so i'm sorry for any mistake I might make.  I have always had a difficult relationship with my mother, mainly beacause we have very different personnalities.  A little backstory: My parents got divorced when I was around 10yo, I have an older sister (who I really get along with).  For as long as I can remember I have always been uncomfortable when people touched me, I do not know why, I have never been assaulted or anything, I just don't like it. I also have a tic where if someone touches me even if not on purpose I will \"swipe\" it away with my hand.   When I was a kid both of my parents used to hug me every night before I went to sleep, but when I got older (around the time my parents divorced) I put an end to it.  The only people I don't mind touching or hugging are: my boyfriend and my sister though it's very rare for me to hug my sister.  Now it's not a secret everyone knows I'm not comfortable with this kind of thing and usually will respect my boundaries.  Everyone except my mother who's love language I think is touch/Hug and mine is act of services. I think it's also important to say that she is single and I live alone with her, so I am the only \"source\" of love availaible.   Two weeks ago she came to me and asked me for a hug, to wich I replied \"not now\" as I have had a stressful day at work and wanted to be alone. She then started crying and I felt bad so I did hug her for like 30 minutes. She calmed down so I thought everything was fine.   Yesterday, we were watching tv and she started crying, so I got up and went to hug her, but she brutally told me not to and to fuck off.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed off, so I responded \"fine, you're pissing me off\" and went to my room.  This morning she told me that she felt the only time I ever hugged her were when she was crying. I feel like it's normal I'm not a monster I will try to cheer up my mother if she is sad. But then she made me feel like I was an asshole for only hugging her when she is sad as I should want to hug her anytime.   So my question is AITA for not wanting to hug my mother ?\n",
      "My GF has a very close friend who is a dentist. A while ago while they were hanging out, he made a verbal promise to clean our teeth for free if we were ever by his office, which is about a 1 hour drive away from our house. I even offered to pay at least a portion of his regular rate but insisted he would do the most basic cleaning for free; any work beyond that he would charge.  My girlfriend recently had to make a trip to his town for the day to do about 3-4 hours worth of personal errands; she said her friend was still willing to do what he promised. I figured it would be worth tagging along in order to get a free dental cleaning.   After our appointments, the receptionist stopped us to ask for payment for MY service (at the request of the dentist which we later found out). I became pretty upset since the entire purpose of me spending half of my day away from home was solely to get the service for free. I felt like it had been baited by his promise, but I simultaneously understood that it was completely his right to charge me for the work that he did. Not many people have the skills to be successful as a dentist and I didn't want to feel entitled to his services. I also understand the struggle of trying to run a profitable business during the pandemic.   In the aftermath, his receptionist told him how pissed I looked after I was told I had to pay, so he offered to send us the money back. I insisted that he kept the money, but we haven't spoken since then. Am I the asshole for becoming livid? Or is the dentist the asshole for going 180 degrees on his promise?  Edit: clarified that the dentist told his receptionist to charge me for my service but not my girlfriend.\n",
      "I (25M) have recently divorced my ex-wife. We didn’t end it on good terms. One thing about my ex-wife is that she acts way too kind and nice in-front of others and because of that is good friends with almost everyone, including my sister. She just turned 18 and everyone is coming to her birthday and she said that everyone is coming and that I should come too, I got suspicious and asked if my ex-wife was coming too. She said yes. I immediately hung up and later explained to everyone how I need some time away from my ex-wife, and being in a party with her doesn’t help. Now my family have said that I’m being a whiny brat for not being there for my sister and putting my own selfishness over her. I tried to explain to them about my situation with my ex-wife and they just told me to grow up and not take it so seriously. AITA?\n",
      "My class in college is very divided, there basically is three groups: A (me and my friends), B and C. Being in the 5th semester, we started talking about the ceremony so we could start paying it already so we have a bigger ammount of time so we don't have to give a big ammount of money in a short ammount of time. As it's not mandatory, many people didn't want the ceremony. In the beggining there were 4 people of group A, 2 of group B and everyone from group C. So when it came to decisions, group C was making the calls, because it being a majority they win.  Turns out that the company that was chosen was very expensive, and that being so two of my friends (F and G) left the ceremony for now with the intention of entering afterwards in case they got a job or internship or if their situation got better. Companies are used to people getting in and out even after the contract is written and signed so it's something that can usually be done.  So after all that it was just me (M) and my friend T from group A, two other woman from group B and group C on the ceremony. We have a group chat in WhatsApp for just the people in the class that are doing the ceremony so we can talk about it. The name of my friend F was mentioned and two woman of group C, Y and Z, started talking about how they weren't going to allow anyone joining afterwards.  Given that the name of my best friend F was mentioned and they started talking shit about her, I took screenshots of the conversation and sent it to the group chat of group A. But something I didn't remember was that G, who also left the ceremony, and Z, the other girl who didn't want to allow anyone entering afterwards, were friends. So when G saw the screenshots she got so mad. G sent the screenshot to Z and said \"is this what I get for helping you with your scholarship?\" and they had a fight bc they were friends and G had the intention to join the graduation if things got better and Z was talking about not wanting to allow anyone else in.   This is when things get ugly, Z started talking in the ceremony group about how there was someone in the group who was sending screenshots of conversations and wanting to start fights. The girls in group C, especially Y, started talking about how the ceremony group needed to be united and Y started to say \"it has to be either M or T who did it\" (me and my other best friend). So, for my friend not to get the blame for something she didn't do I said it was me who did.   Y then said \"Congratulations for your actions, you're out of the ceremony, because we don't need snakes\" and I, being really someone who can't handle an argument and can't really defend myself when I'm alone, just left the group chat because if it's to make a ceremony with those girls I really didn't want to anymore. T left right after. The two girls of B called me saying they want to leave too because Y was being crazy and authoritarian.\n",
      "Long story short, my apartment has huge 6' x 11' double pane windows that have blown gaskets in our living room and bedroom. We raised the issue with the landlord before we moved in and after some negotiation we decided it wasn't as bad as it could be and he made some other repairs and replacements in the unit + we really needed to get a place around the price point he charges.  Now we're in our 3rd year of renting. The windows have gotten worse.   Once when there was a downpour the rain leaked in and the landlord blew it off.  Now we've had a snowstorm where I live and there's snow between the panes and on the inside of the windowsill with the room getting as cold as 48° without blasting the heat. (The landlord used to live here and said he just blasted the heat all winter NBD🙄) I got an estimate and the price would be $10000+ dollars to replace the windows. It's clear that the landlord doesn't really think we have legs to stand on or he'd react differently when we ask him for help or to come see the issues in person. (he lives downstairs.)   Even though we don't have the money for it in our budget, myself, and my partner (who could reaaaaally use the moving costs to save towards our wedding) are strongly considering breaking the lease. AITA?\n",
      "EDIT TO UPDATE: She asked and he is paying for the photos . Thank you to everyone that commented, it was very helpful .  My daughter's prom is next week. Her father and I split when she was a baby. He pays his child support mostly but it's very low having been set 15 years ago based on a minimum wage job. I have never sought to revise this agreement and have never asked him for financial help for things our children wanted to do because it would start a fight. But now I feel as though he SHOULD help pay for things especially since this is an expensive year for her been prom and graduation. The expenses keep piling up from senior photos, cap and gown, prom dress with alterations, hair styling and a year book that I had to pay to put in a message to my child and have to buy the book. I'm in roughly $1k for her senior year things and these photos are under $50. More than likely it will cause an argument between us and he will say something to her about it. I do my best to keep my kids out of our issues but he always drags then into it. I feel like I might be TA because I am fairly certain of how he'll respond.\n",
      "A bit of backstory, me and my girlfriend live in a house that's split up in several different little apartments. Which is pretty common for housing in our city. Pretty much every room in the house has been transformed into a seperate living space for a total of four seperate rooms, occupied by four different tenants.  The main tenant moved out two weeks ago, a new one is expected to arrive in a month. Problem is, the internet connection goes  through  that apartment, not directly to ours.  The tenant that moved out handed the contract over to me. So there's basically an internet connection followed by a modem which I can't access because it's in a different apartment. But I want to reroute the modem to my apartment, since I'm the legal owner of the internet connection. Which would mean that a cable would have to run alongside the wall of the other tenant's apartment into my apartment. I don't trust others with having ownership of the contract, since the older tenant scammed us for years by adding up a TV and phoneline for a grand total of 30 bucks a month extra.  Long story short: Would I be the asshole for letting a cable run along a wall for about one meter in somebody else's living space?  (Sidenote: This will only be for about a month or so, since there will be a fiber connection running through our apartment in a month.)\n",
      "Some talking so, M= mom ME= me   Okay, so I am actually legally married to my husband already because we \"eloped\" for the sake of my sick grandfather being able to see me get married. But we plan on having a big real wedding next year to make it fair for everybody.  Anyway, we told this to our parents and immediately started with making a guest list, I am not one to invite people i am not close to to any event, especially not one as important as my wedding. Well, I'm not close to anyone on my mothers side of the family other than my grandmother, my aunt, and uncle so thats who i am inviting. My mom has 9 siblings and I'm honestly not close to any of them except the two listed above.   My husband is inviting more people from his moms side than his dads but his parents are fine with it as long as grandparents are invited. But when i showed the guest list to my mom she got really upset that she only saw three people from her side and said,   M: why are there more people on dads side invited? ME: because I'm closer to those people. I'm only inviting people I'm close to. Besides your friends are invited.   But even with this explanation she still wasn't happy even though i was inviting 3 of her close friends. She continued to tell me that it's \"rude of me to not invite other people to my wedding.\"  She even tried to bribe me? In a weird way? Saying,  M: the more people you invite the more gifts you get! ME: I'm not interested in gifts, i just want to have a good time with the people I am close to. NONE of your siblings even talk to me besides your younger brother (uncle) and 4th oldest sister (aunt).   She is still pouting about it and I've decided to let her invite two more people from her side of the family but that's it because i want to invite my friends, if I invite more people from her side of the family i wont be able to do this. I have promised myself I will stay firm with this decision since she has used guilt tripping to get her way with me since i was thirteen.   But i still can't shake the nagging feeling that I am being rude. So, AITA?\n",
      "I just got out of an MRI and I really needed to talk with someone about it because I thought I was going crazy (after getting some auditory hallucinations. Fun!) so, I texted my friend, let's call him Kevin.  For context, I really like Kevin. He's super nice, chill, and generally supportive. The thing is, whenever I text him, we start having a back and forth conversation about life, school, friends, memes, whatever. It's really great until, about two to five minutes in, every single time I text him, he suddenly has to go. He always apologizes and I tell him it's fine, but he's done this around  forty times  this year (serious lowball estimate) .  I know and understand that he has things to do, but...40 times in eight, nine months?)  If, however he decides to text me first, it's always asking for something.  What was the homework? Can you help me? When's the rehearsal?  Totally fine. I'm forgetful too, I get it. I tell him when it is, what the homework is, explain everything, and then he just goes offline.  On one hand, I feel like yeah, this is really petty/possessive of me, but also, I just feel annoyed that I can't have a conversation with Kevin.  So, Reddit, would I be the asshole if I called him out on this?\n",
      "Some backstory here. Me (18F) lives with my father(64M), my parents don't live together anymore because of family issues. My oldest sister(42F), lets call her V moved in with us with her son(14M) because our house is big and it's only me and my father. (3 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms). She loves to touch stuff that aren't hers and she moves our stuff without knowing. Then later her daughter also joined us. (22F) My niece, lets call her M, has like 400 pieces of clothing that I let her keep in my wardrobe and also on a spare storage space in my room. I basically only have some drawers since I don't own a lot of clothes. She also tends to sleep in my room when I told her not to, leaves everything a mess with cereal and milk on my bed. Meanwhile V and her son J, are always fighting because he doesn't want to go to school and he has bad grades.  So we can all say they kinda interrupted me and my father's peace. So much so I now tend to sleep in my bf's house and my father on his gf's house. Back to the main story. Me and my sister bicker sometimes, whatever that happens right? Well she can't accept that she is at fault, never.  So yesterday night I made the bold decision of putting my english textbook in the hallway table because I had to remember it or else my teacher would take away from my grade if I didn't show up with it.  This morning, I woke up from a terrible nightmare and I only slept 5h so I was tired and sad and a bit anxious. So I had a shower but had to rush because I was late to catch the bus, and as I was leaving the book wasn't there. I knew it must have been V, in a hurry I just said in a higher tone: where's my book? I keep telling you not to move my stuff without asking! She then called me a beast for speaking in a higher tone, threw my book at the floor in front of me, started screaming and threatning me telling me she's going to shove a chilli pepper in my mouth (she knows im sensitive to spicy food). I also screamed back I admit telling her why is she speaking to me like this when I'm right for being mad. She then told me this. \"You destroy the peace here\" Wow I couldn't handle that and cried, picked up my book and left the house. AITA, did I take it too far? My other sister tells me to walk on eggshells around her but she's 42! She should be able to communicate instead of screaming.  TL;DR: My sister moved an important textbook without me knowing, I was in a hurry and upset so I called her out for it, she starts threatning me.  This happend today, sorry for grammar mistakes I'm still upset and english isn't my native language.  Update: Called my dad, he told me he's going to talk to her. He also said that I should enforce rules but I told him I can't because I'm scared of her. Well let's see how it goes.\n",
      "Something that I feel very guilty about is my relationship with my Canadian grandparents. We never fight, as they are very friendly and understanding, but for some reason, if I email them and they respond back, I wait a few months to gather the confidence to email them again.    I'm very aware of this situation, and I know there isn't anything to be afraid of, but I lack the confidence to write back within a reasonable time period.    Every once in a while, my grandma that I live with guilt trips me about not writing to them, which makes me feel even worse.    I don't know. I haven't seen them in a couple of years, but I still love *them*.    Sidenote:   I felt that I should also mention that we're related through my father that left when I was younger, due to my psychopathic biological mother.    Edit:  them\n",
      "My (26f) husband (28m) were out to a seafood dinner tonight. We spent a significant amount - which we can afford easily.  Usually we pay card but tonight he had cash so he used that. Consider me shocked and appalled  when the time to tip came and he slapped down a whopping.... $2.   I was disgusted.  I always tip a minimum of 25% or $10, whichever is larger  unless I'm given some huge reason not to.  I said \"I KNOW you're not tipping this girl two dollars\"  We argued back and forth a few minutes before he looked up a TIP CALCULATOR  ON HIS PHONE and said \"don't want to over tip\" and finally left more (but in my opinion still not enough).  We argued a bit more which ended in me telling him how much I usually tip and him calling me an idiot for it and me telling him hes being a cheapskate and needs to stop acting broke. (We aren't broke. We've been together since we were kids and I was with him when we were actually really broke)  He called me an asshole for calling him names, we had an awkward ride home  Aita  And for anyone who may wonder why I didn't tip instead, I didn't have my wallet on me.\n",
      "I've recently thrown myself into the dating world  and I'm really enjoying meeting a variety of different people.   I've been seeing someone fairly regularly for about a month and he's a really cool guy! We have a lot of the same interests and he always has fun date ideas. I like him as a person and I want to remain in touch with him but his phone is driving me fucking crazy.   What really bothers me is how his phone will send me the same text message about 4-5 times. Having a text conversation with him is nearly impossible and incredibly frustrating. I'm really busy during the day so having him send one text (which ends up being 4 of the same ones) is really distracting.   A week ago I told him I don't really want him to text me anymore until he either figures out what's wrong with his phone or gets a different one. But he sends me good morning texts every day and- as a sweet as they are, it's annoying as hell and I'm kinda bitter about the whole thing.   So, reddit, WIBTA for ending things with this really sweet guy because of his stupid phone?\n",
      "So to start out i’m 17 and currently live with my mother. She and my dad split up when i was only 6 and my dad moved to Texas and got remarried a few year later, leaving my older sister and I with my mom. Throughout my whole childhood, my mom had serious issues with smoking and drinking. She couldn’t keep a job and slept around with a lot of guys that came in and out of my home whenever they wanted. Things didn’t start getting bad until I was old enough to start doing chores. My mom would have large parties in our small house and then stay out the rest of the day. My older sister took the brunt of her idiocy up until I was 14 or 15.  At that time, I was supporting from abandonment and separation anxiety from my dad, who was always the one who cared about me most. My mom on the other hand never had sympathy and would go off on me for the smallest things like not cleaning up after her, not cleaning the whole house, eating her food, etc.   Now, since I’m almost and adult i’ve been sticking up for myself more. Just these past two years she finally got a steady job and actually tries to keep it. But now that she pays most of the bills herself she hold it over my head that I live in her house so I should follow her rules. She told me my opinions and feelings don’t matter.   At the beginning of summer she dropped me off at my grandmas house and told me I was not welcome home until my attitude changed but she immediately treated me like crap whenever i tried to talk things out with her. She likes to pull the ‘I’m the mother and your the child’ thing to get me to obey her. She also talks bad about me to her asshole bf and her trashy friends. Saying things like i’m a selfish brat, and that I hate her and don’t respect. (which is true because it’s hard to try to respect her)   Recently I refused to clean up her mess and she actually lunged for my car keys to take them from me, cutting my hand open when she ripped off my plastic charms. My older sister picked me up from my house because I was to shaken to drive.   My mother has scarred me. She insults me in front of my friends, calling me a slut because almost all my friends are guys. She shit talks me to her mother. She even shit talks me to my sister, who loves me very much.   It’s gotten to the point where I completely shut down when she’s around and I never tell her anything. She’s cruel and hardly ever tries to connect with me or understand me. She complains to me when she doesn’t get child support and cussed me out when i talk about spending money I got from my job. She even uses the child support for herself, finding trips to the beach or entire wardrobes for herself.   I can’t stand being around her and when I am, I get angered easily. I admit that I cause some issues as well but I really don’t feel like this is my fault anymore after she dashed my attempts at mending our relationship. I can’t tell myself if its really her or if I’m the asshole here...  EDIT: Thank you for your support! I would leave but my sister lives with her boyfriend and my grandmother is emotionally unstable and isolates herself from us. My last resort would be moving with my dads mom in another state and changing schools. I turn 18 very soon so as an adult i’ll be free to leave my current house more often. I appreciate all your encouragement!!\n",
      "My wife moved into my house before we got married . She did put some of her money into some home improvements (10k). We just sold the house to relocate and since it’s a hot market I made 400k in the sale. 300k of that is going into a down payment for our new home. I have paid for everything, closing costs etc and when we move into the new house I will pay for all relocation costs and new furniture. I have already paid off my wife’s IRS debt (7k) that she had before we got married and she just asked that I pay for her 10k credit card debt. I already feel like I’m paying for too much! Her excuse is that I make more than her and can afford it and now with my house sale I have money to pay it and she doesn’t. AITA for saying no and having her pay own debt!\n",
      "Context: I (Chinese, f) invited my two friends (caucasian, m) to a traditional Chinese restaurant. We are all in our 30s and have been friends for half our lives. We live in a diverse area with a significant Chinese population. Traditional Chinese restaurants serve the food family style. We eached picked a dish and when it was served I went to take a little from each dish to add to my plate (separate dinner plates provided, food served on platters with serving spoons).   As I was reaching for the first plate, one friend asked \"what are you doing?\" Other raised his voice and said something like \"you can't take his food without asking.\"   I was confused and explained that Chinese is served family style. They claimed they did not know this and did not want to share their food because they were paying for it and didn't want what I had ordered. I had consulted them on my choice because I didn't want to order something too ethnic that they wouldn't like and their disinterest when I had asked suddenly made sense. I also told them that I had intended to pay for the whole meal since I had been the one to invite them out (which I did). They said they also didn't know this and it did nothing to mollify them. They both seemed very annoyed with me and we spent the rest of the meal eating from our respective platters in awkward silence.   I should have told them about the family style thing but I feel like as adults who grew up in this area who have eaten at Chinese restaurants before, they should have known this. It didn't occur to me at all that they wouldn't. Perhaps I just assumed because we had been friends for so long. I was embarrassed by the whole experience because I knew wait staff and other tables had overheard us. I also feel like they overreacted and am hurt by it.   AITA?  Edit: Wow this blew up. Thank you everyone who has responded. I feel better and it has made me realize that while eating family style at authentic Chinese places is widely known, it is not universally practiced. This was the first time ever I ate only a single dish at an authentic Chinese restaurant and I've probably been to a thousand so I guess it was a new experience for me too.  I wonder if our disparate experiences have to do with race? For instance I've never been asked if I want family style or individual portions at a Chinese restaurant, but I wonder if they ask people of different races because it is not assumed that they know. Or if Chinese restaurants have adapted to cater more to non-Chinese clientele but I haven't seen it because of this assumption?  For all of those saying they never eat family style at Chinese restaurants, I encourage you to enjoy the food in this way. Most dishes are consist of a single protein or vegetable and getting to try a variety of food is part of the joy of eating Chinese. If you're someone used to only ordering orange chicken, it's a wonderful way to branch out and try new dishes.\n",
      "The title makes me seem like a dick but let me explain.   At my (secondary) school my friends and I have a relatively enjoyable schedule of hanging out during recess and lunch chatting with each other about subjects we are all interested in. We are a ‘group’ of five but we make sure that we all maintain sort of friendships with the rest of the class. In which there are several other groups.   Recently, the class became divided on a fight between two classmates. They had a brawl at the lockers and all the girls remained neutral on the topic. The boys, however, all sided with ‘T’ and began to exclude ‘W’. W began hanging with our group as we were the only group of boys that remained neutral on the event, as we were not there when the fight happened.  Here’s the problem: W and our group have nothing in common and we feel so awkward during recess and lunch. W rarely says anything and our conversation feel so negative. Naturally 3 of the people wanted to ditch W during recess so he could take a hint. Another person and I said we should probably just tell him instead. The problem was nobody had the balls to tell W so we ditched during recess and lunch.   I know I’m an asshole for ditching, I don’t need a social media to tell me that, but AITA for not having the balls to tell W?  Edit! We are all 15m\n",
      "EDIT: Both my mom and I apologised to each other. I told her i was sorry for hurting her and tried to explain what my ambitions were. She heard it all and told me aa long as I think its good for me i had her blessings. She Also apologised like all Asian mothers; cooking me my favourite food. So all is good. Thanks for your insights guys.  Before I begin I would like to put out a disclaimer. Both my parents sacrificed A LOT to bring me up. My mom especially threw away a lot of luxuries just so I could have a good life and didnt let anything get in the way of being a good, no, the best mother. This was just a one time incident.  My mother wants me to be a doctor. It was her childhood dream that she couldn't fulfil so she thought she could fulfil it through me. I have nothing against doctors, but I know for a fact it isnt for me. I flat out told her no. She has been quiet for a while but now its time for applying to college and she asked me to apply for med school. Again I repeated what I always said. Nope, not for me.  She started cursing me out and told me i would go to hell for putting her through all this trouble. Then she proceeded to tell me that i was dead to her and she only had one child (my sister).  Something inside me knows that she didnt mean it and she only said it because she was sad. But the other part knows what she said was wrong.  I looked at other colleges (one's that I love) and applied to it. My neighbour asked me in front of my mother if I would miss my family when i leave for college. I said no, infact I Would be glad to get out of here.  My mother is now crying and telling me that I was ungrateful for saying i wouldnt miss them after everything they did for me. I asked her why i would miss her if i wasnt her child. She told me she didnt mean it and that she only said it in the heat of the moment. I told her these are things thats going to hurt me for the rest of my life.  Now half of my family is calling me TA. The other half her and a small percentage says NAH as we both had valid reasons to be upset.  I think I might be the asshole for being rude to her. So, whats your judgement?  EDIT :A lot of people in the comments think I  shamed my family in front of my neighbour. I would like to clear the fact that my neighbour thought I only said that because i was bored of being cooped up in the house all these days. My mother knows that too because she never brought up this point. Also,  I dont know if this will change your judgement but I come from an Asian family that values education over everything.\n",
      "As kids me and my bro (now mid 30's) frequently went to a specific holiday park which we LOVED more than any others. He now has a little boy who is 3 and I've always said I want to take him there when he's 4. My brother is really happy about this and he wants to come too as he has fond memories of the place. His GF also wants to come. We've researched it now and all think it looks great for kids.  I have an older cousin who has two boys ages 4 and 6, and I asked her long ago if she would let them come and I'd pay for them. Since they get on well with my bros kid and play together all the time. I said that she and her partner are obviously welcome, but I'd like to pay for the kids and their activities as my treat for them all. I've never wanted kids but love those 3 and would like to give them a fun holiday at a place me and my bro used to love.  Everyone was happy at first but after time passed my cousin was saying stuff like \"It'll have to be 5 days not a week\" and \"We will need 2 separate places to stay\" adding stuff on. She knows what's best as she has kids so I was like \"yeah sure\" it all sounded reasonable.  But then my cousin said she didn't want to go to that specific place because it had some bad reviews (it has TONS of great ones). She's started making suggestions of other places. Including one she knows I didn't like (really busy and noisey) Me and my brother both said we wanted to go to this one. My cousin wasn't happy, making more reasons why she didn't want to go. Then saying she thought her boys wouldn't like it because of this and that.  Eventually I said. \"If your boys don't want to come that's okay I won't be offended, my brothers kid can bring a friend or his other cousin instead.\" (His mum's friend has a son who he gets on with)  She said it's unfair her boys miss out on a holiday because I won't be flexible. I know it probably wouldn't be a huge deal to change it, but her attitude has put me off. I wasn't doing this for praise, I wanted a fun time with the kids, but I was expecting her to be a little bit grateful or just say \"I'd rather them not go to that one but thank you for offering\".  AITA?\n",
      "My sister (Emily, 32F) and I (24F) were close growing up. We have somewhat of an age difference so my sister was like a second parent to me. Emily and her friend (Alicia, 34F) work in the same company and have been friends for about 5- 6 years. Alicia and her husband Peter (35M) have been a frequent sight at our get-togethers and parties and are friends with my parents as well. We aren't all super close friends, but we do know each other well.   Peter and I started a friends with benefits relationship about 2 years ago. Peter told me that Alicia wasn't treating him right and that he was unhappy in the relationship. A year ago, Alicia found out and divorced Peter. She didn't seem that hung up on the divorce and the affair, as per what Emily told me, so I didn't think it was a big deal to her. Peter and I are still seeing each other.   The problem is that now Alicia keeps making jokes about me and slut shames me when we meet up. I can't just not go to these events because they're MY family events, but I really can't take it every time Alicia insults me. At our Christmas party, Alicia made all kinds of vile jokes about me in front of my family and friends. Some of my friends and my parents defended me, but my sister kept quiet and even laughed at some of them. I was hurt. I asked my sister if it was possible to not invite Alicia to these parties, but my sister said that Alicia feels alone and needs a friend. Well, I feel bullied and emotionally abused and I need my sister. Besides, Alicia already found a boyfriend.   Since covid restrictions have eased, we had a barbecue at my sister's house. Alicia was there and my heart dropped. As expected, she continued to say things about me throughout the event, even in front of her boyfriend. Even after I told her to stop, she never apologizes and tells me to grow a bone.   I confronted my sister privately saying that I can't believe that she's not sticking up for me and that Alicia is being toxic to me, her little sister that she's supposed to protect. I told my sister that we have tons of close friends and that we don't need Alicia in our lives.   My sister got mad at me saying that I deserved Alicia's abuse and that what I did to her was wrong so I deserve anything Alicia says to me. My parents and I did not take this well and we're not speaking to her right now. I'm so hurt because I love and respect my older sister and have always taken her side and it kills me that she's not taking my side over the feelings of a stranger and what's right and wrong.\n",
      "So basically, my dad and brother are not talking to me rn, all because of something I said.  I, (f20) was speaking with my brother (m24) about future plans at my dad’s house. I was saying how I don’t personally want kids but I don’t hate them and wouldn’t mind adopting older kids, my brother was saying how he wants to start a family at some point.   Because of this convo, we moved on how we’d raise the kids. He started telling me how he’d raise his daughters to ”respect” themselves and save their ”value” to their future husband.  As a woman, I was honestly disgusted by this. I didn’t say anything yet but asked ”Then what about your son?”  He then explained how he’ll be teaching his som to pull all the ladies from left and right.  I would have given him a scolding no matter what he replied because his previous comment about a future daughter was disgusting but this threw me off the edge.  I went off on him saying never to have kids because his daughter would grow up hating herself and him and raising kids inequally is just shitty in itself.  This is where my dad came in and said he agrees with my brother and told me if he knew I had sex before I was 18, he would have given me a beating. I also don’t agree with beating kids but I was so annoyed that I kinda brushed it off  I then mentioned he knew my brothers did it, so why couldn’t I do it  He just said it’s not the same. Which doesn’t even make sense because they had to be fucking someone else’s daughter, that’s such absolute shit  I left without even eating dinner like I was supposed to, I didn’t wanna stay any longer.   But now to the actual question. I know that I wasn’t wrong for not agreeing with their weird misogyny, but my brother is angry about the ”never have kids” statement because he absolutely loves children. He refuses to see me and so does my dad. Was that a bit too harsh? Especially as I knew that he really wants children.  Edit: I know that the fact that both my brother and father are misogynistic makes both of them assholes, I’m specifically looking for an answer on if I was justified in saying what I said or will I have to swallow my pride and apologise.  2nd edit: I wasn’t raised by my father, my parents divorced when I was around 8-9. I stayed with my mum, my brother was with my dad. My mum is amazing, I’d say the most amazing parent out there  3rd edit: I can’t cut out these people yet. I have 4 other siblings and my mum so I’d see my brother when I’m with family, I don’t want to make it hard for my mum. My dad is financially helping me right now, I’m in college and can’t work yet. But I am planning on cutting my dad off when I get a job\n",
      "I I did my masters in the UK, but I live in Germany. I set up a weekend with two of my friends from my time there who I know well, and we organised a weekend at one person's flat to watch some Mary Kate and Ashley films. Childish, but we enjoyed them.  I put up a story on Instagram, and had a response from another friend berating me for not telling her I was in London, where she lives.  This friend and I also know each other from my MA time, but in different social circles. We don't really keep in touch very often, apart from customary birthday greetings. While we were students though, we were rather good friends.  She asked me why I didn't tell her I was in town. My reason was that I knew this wasn't a weekend she would enjoy - she is not a fan of Mary Kate and Ashley films, and her vibe is more clubs while we are looking at Deliveroo and drinking some wine while watching films. I knew she would likely spend the night complaining that it wasn't her thing at all or suggesting a change of plans.  She said to me \"what if I went to Germany and didn't tell you? Maybe I will.\"  I told her I would let her know when I was next in London, and she said \"no thanks don't bother.\"  AITA?\n",
      "I live in an off campus apartment with three roommates, but two of them are almost never home. The third one is a music major and is extremely busy but still ends up spending a good amount of time in our apartment. I have other issues with her as a roommate, such as she doesn’t do her dishes, watches tv loudly late at night, takes my food and things without asking, and is just generally inconsiderate and messy. However, because I’m just annoyed with her in general, I think I may be making too big a deal about one thing that she does that bothers me.  Lately, she has started regularly practicing her violin in our apartment. She doesn’t do it late at night or early in the morning and she does it in her own room with the door shut, but her practice is extremely repetitive and so loud that I can hear it down the hall of our building. She does it even if she knows I’m home and she never asks if I am ok with it. Our university has free practice rooms for music students as well as a dedicated building with practice rooms specifically just for strings students(there are only about 20 string students total in our university). Both are about a 20-30 minute walk (but only a 5-10 minute drive) from our apartment. When she practices it usually lasts between 1-3 hours at a time.   I asked her to try to not practice in our apartment as much, especially when she is doing so for hours at a time. She was apologetic initially, but later on I overheard her talking to our other roommate about how she felt like it was an unreasonable request because it is difficult for her to always go to the practice rooms to practice and she felt like I was saying she doesn’t sound good. She doesn’t understand why her practicing in the apartment would bother me and thinks that I’m being mean because I don’t like her or that I’m saying she is a bad musician. She asked my other roommate if her practicing bothers her and my other roommate said no. Now she’s angry at me and is complaining to our mutual friends that I don’t understand how difficult it is to be a musician and that I’m being inconsiderate and mean.   Is it unreasonable to expect her not to practice in our apartment? Am I the asshole for asking her to use the school’s practice rooms?\n",
      "I've worked at a local thrift store for just over a year and a half now. The turnover rate is very high, we have 20 employees and only 4 of them are remaining from the \"old crew\" from when I was first hired.  I quickly became the \"jack of all trades, master of none\" after the daytime maintenance guy quit and depending on the day's needs I would be doing janitor work, running register, working the sale floor, or sometimes all 3 if enough people called off or just didn't show.  When I was hired the state minimum wage was $8.30 but they started me at $8.50, and around Christmas last year I got a raise which took me to $8.77. This year our state's minimum wage was raised to $8.55 and that is where they have been starting all the new hires at.  Lately they have been scheduling our hours based on performance and some of us are only getting 2 or 3 days a week so we will \"step it up\". When we are on the floor working on projects our manager will have other coworkers stalk us to make sure we are doing our jobs, they're trying to turn us all against each other.  On top of that I have had to deal with things nobody ever should in retail. I've been spit on, chased by tweakers, watched as someone on the bench outside shot up heroin, scrubbed shit off the ceiling of the family restroom once, and tons of other bad run-ins.  I found a new job where I am guaranteed 30 hours a week at $9.50 an hour which I could not turn down. I wanted to leave for my own good. I put my 2 weeks in on Monday and when I told everyone at first they thought I was kidding since I'm basically the Yoda of the damn place now. But when everyone found out I was for real, one of the sweet older daytime ladies actually began crying, and everyone else wanted to hold me a party or go out bowling or something. I was sort of everybody's \"hope\" since I've stuck around through so much of the bullshit that has been going on.  AITA?\n",
      "For context: I don’t live in America, in my country we have high walls that separate the frontward from the streets. My house happens to be a corner house, so half is the frontward wall and half is my actual house walls.  Some kids of my neighborhood like playing football in the streets, which is fine normally. But they like to play right where my house wall is, and even make sure to throw as hard as they can, ON THE WALL.  Some days I have to come out and tell them to stop THREE TIMES. AND THEY KEEP COMING BACK. I cant study in peace even in my own home.  I know why they play there, there’s plenty of space and stuff to make a nice goal. But the noise and… vibration(?) bothers me so much.  Am I overreacting? They are just kids after all. Should I tell their parents? Put a sign in the wall? Idk what to do to make them stop.\n",

Despite this, I love her very much. However she's been pissing me off lately.

The real problem is that despite this, Trina's ex-friend Georgia stayed friends with Jade. Trina hates Georgia because of this.   Georgia is. Something. She is actually an ex of mine who was extremely manipulative and abusive, gaslighting me and leading to the death of almost every meaningful relationship in my life. I'm lucky I've built said relationships back up. Recently however I've also been rebuilding a relationship with Georgia. Georgia knows I have not and never will forgive her for what she did to me, but I'm forced to see her every day due to school and I got tired of being bitter and angry every time I saw her. So we are now on speaking terms. For more background, Georgia and I dated twice. The first time was wonderful and she was great, even after we broke up. Between that relationship and our second one she dated our mutual friend Andi. She was also incredibly abusive and manipulative towards Andi. And she 'talked' to me while she was dating Andi but told me they had broken up (I only recently found out they had still been together, Andi and I are super close now and there is no resentment whatsoever about any of it). Georgia and I dated the second time and it was awful, it led to a very serious decline in my mental health. Despite this I am on speaking terms and am occasionally friendly with Georgia. Like I said, I'm tired of being angry and bitter and upset.  Trina hates that I talk to Georgia. Whenever she sees me talking to Georgia she would get in my face after and berate me forever for for talking to her, telling me I'm an awful person, etc. She also ignores me and tells lies about me as a result of me talking to Georgia. For context Trina was besties with Georgie before I started talking to Georgia again and Trina knew that Georgia had abused me severely. Here's where I may be the asshole. I got tired of Trina, so one day while we were somewhere and she started up again I snapped. I told her she needed to watch her fucking mouth, and that I was tired of her bullshit and that she needed to mind her business because it didn't matter if I decided to date or fuck or do anything I wanted with Georgia, that was my business. And I told Trina she had absolutely no right to dictate who I was and was not friends with, ESPECIALLY for a reason as petty as the one she had. She started crying and I just walked away and haven't really spoken to her since. Our friends are split between being on my side and being on her side. AITA?\n",
      "Long time lurker, first time poster, mobile etc etc. Title is a bit misleading and it’s a little long, but I didn’t know how else to word it, so please hear me out!  This was a few years ago now, but I’ve always wondered if I genuinely caused this or not. My (f, then 22) now ex boyfriend’s (then 20), mother and I never got a long. She was very much upper middle class and thought that I, being from a working class background, just didn’t meet the correct criteria to be with her son. Her attitude was always that I was trying to trap him and get pregnant, but that’s a whole other story.   This instance in particular, I had left some stuff with my boyfriend to store over the summer until we moved in together, but we ended up cancelling the flat we were supposed to move into after he broke up with me. This meant I couldn’t get my stuff until mother was in our university city to see him.   She picked the date of my birthday party. A very busy day for me, and my boyfriend (we got back together it was a whole mess) where we running on a very tight schedule and he made sure she knew this. She was due to arrive at 10:30am and by 12pm she still wasn’t here. I’d killed time making sure the house was ready and thought I’d just nip to the neighbours and let them know I was having a party and pass my number on incase they wanted anything turning down. It was only supposed to be a 5 minute trip as both neighbours are immediately next to us.   However, when I got to the second neighbours house, an elderly lady, I discovered she’d had a fall so I went in and helped get her up and make her a cup of tea and rang another neighbour to come and sit with her. My boyfriend was still in my house just incase his mum turned up, so I didn’t worry too much, but still made sure this lady was ok as quickly as I could without seeming rude or uncaring.   When I walked back round to my house, his mother had turned up and she was furious. She didn’t mention that she was almost two hours late, but flew at me, screaming in my face, hands on my shoulders occasionally shaking me, about how important her time was and how inconsiderate I was to waste it and how she expected no better from the likes of me and would be glad when the day came that she was shot of me. I was very shaken by this and couldn’t really speak at all. She stormed to her car and left and I broke down once I was back in the house.   This was a long time ago, I’m not even with the guy in question anymore and I’m 99% sure she massively overreacted, but it still comes back to me sometimes and I honestly wonder, AITA for spending more time ‘necessary’ at the neighbours house when I should have been waiting for her?  There were many other things this woman did to screw with me and our relationship, but this is the only one that I really question my part in.\n",
      "So for a little backstory I was a minor working for a chain american pizza place. I worked there for about 4 months up until I quit. I basically got the job super easy because my older sibling was the assistant general manager. So, a lot of people at the job had a kinda sour attitude towards me. Mainly just 2 people in particular. About 1 month and a half before I quit we came under new management.   All seemed well, but about 3 days in I was dealing with school stuff and asked to take a few weeks off to focus on school, and he said yes. I took the weeks off did what i needed to do and then texted him asking me to put me on the schedule. He said no. He called me irresponsible and he didn't know if he wanted me back. Find out a few days later he was telling all my coworkers I quit and took me off the payroll. I called him explaining the situation and got my job back. This was situation number one that really put me off.   Next incident, a few weeks later it's back to school season the store is super slow. Manager gets a call from the boss and walks outside. She comes in and tells me to come outside. She tells me I have to go home early. This was my first time getting sent home so i simply asked \"Did I do something?\" and my manager responded \"Just go clock out\". So I went to go and clock out manager walks in and hands me her phone boss starts yelling at me and telling me to stop talking back. I barely spoke to anyone that night besides customers and can assure that i never spoke back to anyone.   Third incident this is with the manager who sent me home. I clocked out for the night, and because i was still off the payroll i had to receive tips in cash. I was clocked out fully other manager gives me my tips I walk out. I get a call from my sister that manager who sent me home called my sister to tell her she's gonna get me fired for leaving the register open. I never opened the register manager did. I did not get fired as cameras showed I didn't leave it open. As all of these events are happening and over the weeks manager is lying saying I don't do work, i talk back, and have a attitude problem.   Last incident, I was at work already upset, because I suffer from bpd and make inpulse decisions. I was wanting to quit. The other assistant general manager made me sweep the restaurant, no problem idc. Then the agm told me to do something with dough and i kept texting my mom and writing my letter to quit just incase something happened. Manager tells me to get off my phone and that was just my final straw because she sits around and just plays on her phone. I let it slip im quitting and not just leaving early she immediately calls gm. Next day I text gm message saying \"As you may already know last night was my last night working at papa johns. The biggest reason being you allow certain managers to bully and mistreat everyone at the store. Even you yourself bully and mistreat workers. I do not want to work at a job where people are allowed to gang up on one person, be dishonest, bully, put all the work on certain people while they do nothing, and I don't want to work at a place where a boss doesn't do anything but sit at home and won't go to the stores and fix anything himself. I won't be apart of your soap opera.\" We texted for a little after that explaining everything. Then the next day he called my sister asking if she thought everything i said was true. So am I the asshole?\n",
      "My (51F) husband (52M) of five years is upset with me because I asked that his mother not prepare the entire Thanksgiving meal (sans meats) and bring it to our home. Annually, we serve the meats and ask each guest to bring a side from our menu. Every year she brings every side she can think of. We often end up with two of everything. Dinner is hosted at our home so literally she’s bringing in boxes of food in pots and pans. My husband believes I should just tell her to bring one side (I have). I believe he should ask her once I ask and she ignores the request. He says she’s older so if she enjoys bringing the food, he’s not going to stop her. But at the end of the night after all of the to-go plates are packed, much of the food she prepared is thrown away. Seems like such a waste to me.\n",
      "For context, I live with a roommate. He’s chill. His gf is planning on staying with us for the majority of the month of January. I don’t mind, really. But they like to chill in the living room where my Xbox is. I have the newer games and such so I keep it out there, so that I can play FPS and when friends are over and stuff we can all play sports games. My roommate enjoys playing Fifa and has his own ultimate team and stuff on my account, again, which I don’t mind. But since his gf is here and they spend time watching stuff on the TV where my Xbox is, I want to move it back into my room so I can play in peace. He asked if I’m going to keep it there permanently and I said I’d probably keep it there for a bit, until gf is gone bc I don’t want to grind games for hours in the living room with a guest. He’s kinda upset, especially bc he loves his Fifa and won’t be able to play it for like a month. I told him he can spend time with his gf instead and I’ll move it back out later. He’s kinda salty but I really don’t see a huge problem with this.   TLDR: roommate’s gf here for a month so I moved my Xbox back to my room, roommate now can’t play video games.\n",
      "Hello! So, as far as housemates and rooming situations go, I am very thankful for both the home and people I live with. All three of us are in our mid to late twenties, working professionals. We also consider ourselves friends. We each have a private bedroom and share the rest of the house, which has ample living space. One preference I have that I realize may be different than others is a strong dislike for anyone being in my bedroom room without my being in there. it weirds me out, and feels strongly invasive. I’m generally pretty sharing with specific things people want to borrow or share, but for whatever reason, when it comes to my room, it’s more like a privacy reason, than a personal possessions issue. I respect that not everyone feels that way, and that others would be more flexible or comfortable with that.   Both of my housemates are aware of this. However, I feel like one in particular brings it up and wants to push it. Like, she’ll say in conversation, “I respect your boundaries but sometimes I’ll go in to see Cat” (that sleeps in my room).” Or she’ll mention that she likes to look at the progress I’m making in there ( I recently switched from one of the other bedrooms and am redoing my new one).  The cat she mentioned is often only in my room in my bed that can’t be seen from the door, or inside the door. Cat has gradually become my pet over the last few years, never belonging to this individual housemate, but to a prior one who left cat behind.   I don’t want to be petty, and would like to keep a good friendship and living arrangement. I get a strong feeling that she thinks if we were closer friends, she’d be able to just go in my room whenever, and she has repeatedly invited me to use her space as necessary (our house does not run air and she has a window AC), which is very kind. However, I still don’t feel comfortable with her or others being in my room without my being there.   Would I be the asshole for saying please stop going in my room? I know she isn’t messing with anything or stealing anything, which is why I thought I would ask here before having another conversation.\n",
      "So, a friend of mine and I planned to play videogames together on sunday evening. When the time came she wrote me that shes too tired and if we could play tommorow (wich is today)   A few hours ago i wrote her to tell me when she is ready to wich she replied yes.  Now she called me to ask if we could reschedule it to tomorrow because another friend of her wanted to play with her.   For context, she offered that we could play for a short while and then she will go after some time to play with him.  I am kinda pissed, as we already rescheduled it yesterday but I told her she could do whatever she wants. On the other hand i do understand that she can play with who she wants whenever she wants.  Am I in the wrong?\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have been living in a small apartment for about a year and have starting looking for something with a bit more space as we are earning enough and have a lot of stuff (a few huge books cases, piano, sewing equipment, etc).  I was looking at a cool place for us and remarked \"but what on earth would we do with three bedrooms? It seems far too extravagant\" and he responded that maybe his father (50ish) and sister (30ish) along with her four year old son if she gets him back.  For context, his family is often jumping between homes or couch surfing because they are drug addicted and don't tend to do much work. His sister has consistently proven to not respect me or my things, has stolen from us, and has absolutely no manners. Easily the worst person I've ever known. Am I the asshole for not wanting them moving in? I just want to feel safe in my home.  Edit: the woman is homeless and has a achild. I have the means to provide a home and how could I live with myself knowing I'm leaving her on the streets.\n",
      "I’m struggling to decide whether I should make this the year that I finally reach out to my parents again.  It’s been about 2.5 years now and I have healed tremendously since cutting them out of my life. I look at pictures of myself from back then and it’s like a totally different person in some ways.   They were and still are, according to my sibs, very negative and manipulative. I’d like to go into details but for the sake of being concise I’ll just leave it at that.  However, I’m worried that I’ll regret it if I keep going without talking to them. I have a son who has no idea who they are (he was a baby when I cut them off) and it would be cool for him to know that he has grandparents on my side. They send him gifts all the time which I either throw out if they are just tiny or if they are bigger I give them to him without context so they don’t get wasted. He’s still super little so he doesn’t ask where something comes from or who my parents are. But he’s almost at that age. He’s super smart and I can see that coming up soon.  I was always very close to my mom and I am so sad that she took the position she took and is defending the person who abused me and gaslit me for years and years. It took a lot of courage to make this decision and get out of the toxic, abuse cycle and I don’t want to ever submit myself to another one ever again.  My SO is extremely supportive of whatever decision I make but he says that I shouldn’t feel pressured to do something just because my siblings are saying I’m being unfair or I’m hurting my parents.  My siblings always ask when I will start talking to them again because they hate the tension.  On the flip side, I know how bad it would hurt if my kid decided to just stop having a relationship with me and that breaks my heart beyond belief so I understand how hard it must be.  I feel like I’m a bad person because I told my mom over text that I would get in touch soon (well, she got in touch and so I felt pressure to give an answer so I said soon) and that was last summer but I’ve had so much anxiety and mental trauma and illness that I just can’t yet.  I still feel weak and embarrassed and emotional over this relationship. I feel like such a bad person because I’m a parent now and I would rather have a dagger to the heart than lose my relationship with my son. But I’m also a daughter and a person and I need respect and I don’t get that with them.\n",
      "I’m ( 19, F ) dating this really amazing guy ( 20, M ). However, lately whenever he says he’s going to be somewhere for a date/meet up he’s always significantly late or he leaves midway through to go hang out with his friends.  He is always super nice and caring when he is around and I love being with him. So that’s why I’m worried about possibly being the asshole since I am so upset about him being late/leaving halfway through important dates.  But, it was even to the point where he went to go hang out with his youth group when we were supposed to have my birthday dinner a few days ago.   Currently I am waiting for him to come pick up stuff that he accidentally left in my dorm and he decided to go grocery shopping first instead, despite telling me that he was going to be coming to pick up his stuff first.  I told him that I can’t wait for him longer than a certain amount of time, but he still expects me to since Im his girlfriend. However, there is stuff I still want to do outside of just constantly waiting and being stood up.  He implied I would be the asshole if he didn’t get his stuff returned and that I am the asshole for asking him to figure out a specific time to pick stuff up, due to his difficulties planning ahead due to ADHD.  So Reddit I’m just wondering AITA for getting increasingly short and upset with him for being constantly late or bailing partway through?\n",
      "I’m a uni student (20 M) but I work full time at a restaurant. The work is long (11 hour days 40-50 hour weeks). Friday was my last day after 4 months of being back. The only thing getting me through the week was watching the NFL kickoff game with my brother last night. However because I was working 11am-10pm -tues-wed-thurs-friday and the game was starting around 2am thursday night (uk) we decided to record it and watch it as soon as I get home on Friday night. Before I went to work today I deleted all my social media apps etc to make sure I don’t accidentally see the score.   Then when I got into work the first thing I did was tell my boss/head chef (40s M) that I was avoiding all nfl scores and in case he was to tell me. He doesn’t follow the nfl but he knows I play football at uni and watch it.   I told him that it’s the only thing that’s gotten me through this week, expressing it means a lot to me. He said he wouldn’t tell me but mentioned that I shouldn’t tell our other chef (20 m) Matt. I asked and he said “cause he’s a little prick, he’ll find out the score and tell you” then we chuckled. Matt mentioned the nfl being the 100th season and I immediately told him the same thing I told my boss. He understood & promised not to tell me anything.   I was in a great mood and having a great day until  around 6 the radio went onto a sports segment. Matt told me to cover my ears. I had them covered for what felt like a minute. Then my boss gestured to me and I took my fingers off my ears, then he said to me “The bears won”.   “I really hope your joking and you haven’t just told me” I said in a serious tone. Then my heart started racing and my hands were shaking. He doesn’t know the names of any nfl team. He either heard “the packers won” or “the bears won”. I assumed the packers won and he is telling me the bears won to fuck with me. This messed with my head & I think I had a small panic attack for about an hour.   I couldn’t confront him because he was either going to say “I was joking” meaning the packers won or “I’m sorry I shouldn’t have told you” meaning the bears won. I was furious. I told Matt and he sympathised. I wanted to die in a hole but I had to work 3 more hours in a very stressful environment. I went deadly quiet and concentrated on the orders, almost giving my boss a cold shoulder whilst trying to remain professional. Before I left he said “thank you for this summer, you’ve been amazing. The door is always open” I shook his hand and said thank you & left asap. I didn’t want to ruin my chances of coming back next summer. I would only be hurting myself. I drove home and vented to my mum and brother and cried. I was hurt. I feel like if he had any respect for me he would have helped me avoid scores.   I watched the game with my brother and tried to put it out of my mind. Very lucky to have such a caring family. They looked after me.   Sorry for my poor writing I hope this made sense. AITA?\n",
      "I have an upcoming trip and I like to dress as comfortable as possible while flying. Something I like to do is take off my shoes, but wear comfy socks (think fuzzy ones) that will only be worn while I’m on the plane. It’ll almost be like slippers, and I would keep my shoes under my seat. However, I do not know if this is an inconsiderate thing to do, and I would like some input beforehand. Thanks in advance.\n",
      "Edit: if you guys  really  believe that I'm no question the bad guy in this situation, go check out my post called \"Horrible Home life\" maybe you'll be able to relate to me a bit more, even if you still think I'm the asshole. My mom is going insane with giving me a bunch of chores to do in her garden. (I'm 13 for context) But I don't get allowance and i never get played for any of them!! She has the gall to criticize my work ethic when all I want is some cash for my work! AITA?\n",
      "Hi me again. I’m a second year student living in the same accommodation as I did last year. I have two room mates one living next to me and the other one across from me. Both are really nice people and I respect them both. However the room mate next to me has a tendency of playing his music really loud throughout the night, and one time it got so loud to the point I had to ask him to quieten down with his music. He did however he said the only reason he did it was because he was upset and he assumed I was drunk. I feel like the asshole because I know he has issues and he obviously enjoys his music. AITA?\n",
      "When I (f21) originally thought of this idea, I thought of it as a wake-up call. My mom usually handles criticism like this:  Me: “Mom, I think you could change this.”  Mom: “Well I think you could change this about yourself.”   Which eventually escalates to her repeatedly screaming stfu to me. Any serious point I need to get across to her must be done through text or she’ll just drown me out. Sometimes it’s not effective since she just resents the topic. Also, I don’t mean to generalize, but we’re an Asian family. There’s the dynamic of respect and what not that I won’t get into, but you get the gist.   I brought this up to my younger sister (f14) who replied, “Don’t you think that’ll make her mad?” I said I feel like she’d get mad for two reasons: she’ll get mad because she feels I’m being sensitive (when I asked her why she felt the need to say her situation is worse than mine every time I complained about anything, she said she doesn’t want to raise sensitive children) AND/OR she can’t handle the consequences of her actions being brought to her face. These being that I am really turned off from having a relationship with her and that she’s just making me feel bad with her actions and comments.   My sister and I talked it over and decided we’d do it, but despite having bought our journals a week ago, we keep having to push it off to the next day because we keep having at least one bad interaction with her (I didn’t want to start off bad.) For example, she often starts the day commenting on how I look unkempt, lazy, or “Why don’t you have a bra on around the house, you’re not a slut” (the ending can be changed to you’re trashy, disgusting, etc.) The best days tend to be when she doesn’t say anything to me. Asian parents often use shaming to try and help their children make better choices so I guess it might be coming from a good place? Ultimately, I hope she can see over the course of almost a year how often negative our interactions are through my eyes. Her relationship with my little sister is a bit different, but when we shared our experiences, I was surprised to find out my mom still pulled the same things on my sister that she does with me. To a degree it’s harder because she can more easily invalidate my sister due to her young age.   My mom has her own set of problems, especially in her marriage. She’s expressed to my sister that she thinks my boyfriend and I are almost too in love until she realizes that her own marriage is not even at the bare minimum of respect. I won’t get into the details, but even if it’s not physical abuse, I think it definitely borders mental abuse. I love my mom and I don’t want to further her pain and anger, but our relationship is suffering. So on a day of celebrating her as a mother and what with her own personal problems, WIBTA for giving her a journal expressing how I feel towards our daily interactions as part of her Mother’s Day present?  EDIT: Already a quick edit, thank you for the responses, I realize now that this “gift” is coming from a place of hurt and has that same intention. I want to foster a good relationship so while as many said it’s important to still do it, I won’t do it on a day that’s meant to be a celebration of her. The genuine thoughtfulness in the responses is appreciated.\n",
      "So, my partner (26M) and I (26F) have lived together for almost 4 years. We share finances pretty completely at this point and there is really no “my money” and “his money” anymore. We both work full-time, no children. A few years back we lost our previous apartment and racked up a lot of debt when he abruptly signed a lease on a brand-new car a few years back without talking to me first. For almost 2 years now, we have lived in our current place, and have had slightly better financial habits and have begun to recover from that. I know many of you will say I should have left then, but it’s easier to say than to do and I have my reasons. This morning we woke up to his cell phone ringing, it was our landlord who was telling us there was a shut off notice for our gas bill (which is in my partner’s name). My partner went downstairs and got the bill, it is set for shutoff on Jan. 20th and we owe over 400 dollars. Hardly anything in our apartment uses gas, so that was pretty shocking. Turns out it’s typically $10-15ish a month but he just... hasn’t paid it. Admitted he has only paid it one month, ever.  Upon fully understanding the situation, I took a big deep, calming breath and said to him, “I really do not want to have to go ballistic about this. Can you acknowledge right now what a huge f***-up this is instead of me having to start a big fight?” Our relationship has been rocky lately and I’m just so tired of fighting for him to act decent. He replied, “Ok” in a dismissive tone with a hand wave. I let out a big exhausted sigh and proceeded to recap the situation in my own words, then asked him “Do you really think you’re being reasonable?” He kept on with the nasty tone and dismissive attitude, and tried a few times to leave the room then said “I’m just trying to go take care of it and pay it, I guess you don’t want that?” when I asked him to please discuss it with me like an adult. Of course at this point I was getting mad and my voice was getting louder and harsher, but I really felt justified.  We both earn barely over minimum wage, we live paycheck to paycheck and we do not have enough wiggle room to be this idiotic.  Thankfully our stimulus check saved our asses on this one, but I’m still really upset and he seems to think it is not that big a deal. He did say sorry, but he said it in a snarky and irritated tone and when I continued to be upset he kept going “I already SAID sorry”. It’s been paid, and he promises to pay it monthly from here on out, but I just want to see genuine remorse because this felt pretty screwed up. So, AITA?\n",
      "Let’s start with this. I am a first generation Asian American, and I was born unaware to most social issues and politics. To explain what I mean, I don’t have any role models or a profound hero, any interest in the aspect of living the perfect American boy dream ... the lists goes on and on.... The only focused or purposed that I had is to follow my parents’ wishes. Go to school, be a good boy, get straight “A”s and get a bachelor degree. WHICH I failed badly at it.  To get to the point, I have two brothers and three sisters. As the oldest I would watch and take care of my siblings to the best of my capabilities. I failed at that as well. Now in my mid-twenties (still living with my parents), and during this pandemic I still tried my best to look out for my siblings. However, my brother, the third child is complaining that we are all worthless pieces of shit and doesn’t do anything in the house, he wishes that he was the oldest and “educate” us to become “smart human beings”.  Note: we were all over 18 and pursuing our education.  He wasn’t like this at first. While the third brother goes to school, the rest of us supports him, along with ours studies. We would make his meals, do his chores and let him focus on his “so-called” hard studies. When he finally got his certification in engineering (his 6 month program) and make 24 plus dollars per hour. We were all proud of him, and hope that he will supports us like we support him. It was wishful thinking. My mother favorite him more now and hope that he is always successful in the long run.   Note: my parents are getting a divorce, and it plays a role to this confrontation, but for now that’s another story.  Continuing. On occasion, my siblings and I would argued with my third brother about supporting us like we did to him. He does nothing in the house, and plays the money card and the mom card when we gets into fights. “he made more money than anyone in the household” and deserved to relax on his spare time. “Mom like me more and when the pandemic is over, she will kick everyone out of the house”.   The rest of my siblings turn to me for help and answers. I didn’t answer because I don’t really know what to do or says anything supportive. Parents divorce. School. A place to live. My future. My passion. Financial after the pandemic. AITA for not being a supportive Big Brother???\n",
      "Hi all,   Thank you for reading, I would like your advice/judgement on this since it's not very easy.  My niece, let's call her Jane,  is 26 years old. She is the daughter of my sister who passed away 4 years ago after an illness that lasted more than 15 year.  Jane is a great girl, she really is. Smart, intelligent, she had a very rough childhood because of her mother's illness and took care of her until the day she passed away, for which I am very grateful. She also took care of the administration after her death and kept on taking care and helping her grandmother (who is my mother).  My mom and Jane have a great relationship. Jane studied at university and found a job in her university town, 1,5 hours away. She still kept on visiting my mother every weekend, even staying from friday evening till sunday evening, even took days of when she had to go to he hospital to take care of her, help her pay her bills, took her dog in when she was in the hospital, arranged help at home for my mother etc.  I live 10 minutes away from my mother, but work at night, so in daytime I sleep. I also have 2 sons who are 20 and 22, so they are a bit young to help their grandmother.   2 years ago, Jane met her boyfriend Daniel (30M). Last year, in november and december, my mother often felt alone, cried a lot, was in and out of the hospital. When she felt sad, I asked Jane to call her or visit her because I didn't have time for that (as said, I work at night and sleep during the day). Jane also had to take care of my mom's dog when she was in the hospital because, again (I work at night). I also asked her to bring my mom to the hospital during the day a few times because I had to sleep.  Anyway, since a few months, Jane does less for my mother, and for me. She no longer runs all the errands, when my mom doesn't feel great and I call her early in the morning,  she doesn't immediately stop by to pick the dog up but asks to see how the situation goes, she no longer runs my errand either when I can't. Now she only visits one time a week (for exemple after work) and no longer on weekends it seems, instead of calling my mother each day, she only calls every other day.  I now am in in a situation where I have to do A LOT for my mother, I run errands, I sometimes pay her bills when there are some, sometimes I even need to change plans for this, and to be honest, I don't think it's fair. I don't think this fair on me, nor on my mother, because it's not her fault that her daughter passed away.  I would like Jane to step up more and stop being selfish.  Tl;dr: AITA for wanting my niece to help out with her grandmother?\n",
      "I (32f) know this sounds bad but hear me out. My mom (43f) and my brother (26m) have been on the outs since my mom moved to another state several years ago. My mom always calls me just to ask about my brother. She has no interest in anything going on in my life. Recently my brother was trying to loose the cops while driving under the influence and got into an accident. As far as I know, he immediately got out the car and ran away from the police. I was told about it from my dad. A few weeks later I get a passive aggressive message from my mom saying \"Thanks for not telling me you brother was in a car accident.\" I got mad and didn't bother messaging her back. I'm so tired of being in the middle of my mom and brother. I feel like they need to grow up and leave me out of their mess.\n",
      "Actually it has gotten to the point where I just refuse to accept packages for them anymore...  I work from home so all couriers bring packages to us when our neighbors are out. Happy to do it, much more convenient than having to collect from the depot or risk being damaged or stolen.   All our neighbors collect the packages as soon as they come home. Except one neighbor. The record is we’ve had their package for 6 days and it was only that short because my wife caved and delivered it to them.   It’s happened about 10 times now. At first, maybe the courier didn’t leave a note, or maybe they have been away and we didn’t notice. Gave them the benefit of the doubt.   But now I’m certain the courier has been back to give them a note, I’ve kept an eye on when they’re returned home. They are 100% just too idle or scared(?!) to make the trip across the road to collect.   We used to take the packages straight round but now I refuse and we just wait for them to collect. Often my wife just thinks I’m being petty and takes them over. Although more recently I’ve just told the courier we don’t accept parcels for those neighbors.   tl;dr we sometimes take parcels in for our neighbors, and they take too long to come and collect them. I refuse to take them over or point blank refuse to take them in. AITA?  EDIT: Typo\n",
      "Throwaway as people mentioned have Reddit and I don’t want to link it to my main.  Annie, Belle (fake names) and I(20sF) are roommates. Belle is vegan but Annie and I are not.   However Annie was brought up in a religious household that doesn’t consume beef, her parents were strictly religious but as she grew older, her parents learnt to relax their religious control and allowed Annie to consume beef as long as it’s not in the parent’s house as the house has a praying altar.  From what Annie told us, she started trying beef in her late teens, but as beef has a weird meaty smell she is not used to, she eats between medium to medium well doneness. She said even lamb meat has a meaty smell if not cooked right. So she seldom eat both meats, but is always open to try.  In our home, Belle has her own cooking utensils and cooks on her side of the stove, for Annie and I, we cook in rotations, before we cook, we do inform each other what’s cooking etc.   For dinner, Annie is aware that I’m making beef stew with rice and buttered corn. I’m not an expert so I thought the beef cubes was done in medium but found out it’s medium rare when we began eating. I was afraid that it won’t suit Annie’s taste so I told her I can let the pot cook longer if she wants and I can take her current portion.  Luckily she said she likes the texture and can actually get used to the doneness, she won’t eat it too often but it’s baby steps to get used to it.  Belle on the other hand wasn’t very happy. She tore into me about serving ‘uncooked’ beef to Annie despite knowing her diet habits. Although I apologized and Annie said it’s alright, Belle thinks it’s just an excuse for me to slack off when cooking and that I’m risking Annie’s stomach by cooking something she isn’t used to eating. Then started comparing how it’s also rude if Annie and I serve her meat when we know she’s vegan.  It took Annie awhile to calm Belle down before we resumed dinner. Even though Annie says it’s alright and she’s satisfied with the food, I still feel guilty from Belle’s words.  So I’d like to have outsiders’ judgement on this.  AITA for cooking beef for a roommate who isn’t used to eating it?  Edit: I mentioned ‘stove’ as a whole with a certain number of burners on it. I didn’t know a stove meant a burner until I googled so if anyone is confused, there’s 4 burners in the kitchen, Belle usually uses the ones on 1 side while Annie and I uses the other side.\n",
      "Specially the midterm is for an anthropology class which I’m not super great in. The way my professor does her exams is there is a practice exam that u have to score a 76% in before you can even access the “real” midterm. Each is 125 questions that have to be finished in under 70min. You can take the practice as many times as u like but the real one only twice. I had to do the practice one twice due to not completing it quick enough before I could unlock the real one. So I was already about 2hrs and 30min into it by the time I get to the real one. About halfway into the 70 min my bf stops playing his video game. I forgot which one but he has headphones connected to his computer so all I hear is keystrokes. He comes over and sits next to me and looks at my computer screen and reads the question I’m answering. He googles it and then changes the answer from what I choose to a different letter(it’s multiple choice). I tell him that’s not the right answer cause I remember I picked that answer before on the practice midterm and got it wrong. He then goes on his phone and plays an Overwatch video on his phone and normal volume. I’m irritated by that but don’t say anything and try to keep focusing on my midterm. After a couple minutes the streamer on the video screams about getting a kill or something and I snap a little. I said” ok. Can u please turn it down.”  Granted this was in an irritated tone of voice. He looks at me like I’m crazy and I really snap. I don’t remember exactly what I said but it was something along the lines of dude I’m taking a fucking final. And he gets pissed off so he turns the volume all the way up.  I decide to just get up and leave and use my phones hotspot to try to complete the final but I end up running out of time and getting a 52%. And to use the second chance for the real midterm I have to do the practice one over again and reunlock the real one so I have at least another 2:30 hours of work left. When I texted him that I failed cause of his pettyness he said it was my fault that I failed the midterm cause I could have done it a bunch of other times, that I had plenty of time that day and should have been finished with it by the time he came, that his video wasn’t a problem because “he couldn’t even hear it”. No matter how many times I said it was disrespectful and inconsiderate to play a video right next to someone who needed to concentrate he firmly believes that I failed because of myself. He also wanted me to apologize for snapping at him which I did. In his words i “came at him sideways” and that’s y it was justified for him being petty and turning the volume all the way up. So aita? And is it my fault that I failed the final even through I think I could have made a passing grade if I didnt have to get up and leave in the middle?\n",
      "Okay so characters of this story are me (18F) and friend(18F). Let’s name friend Crystal.  I’m already the asshole in the first part of the story. At least we both were if I give myself the benefit of the doubt.  Crystal and I were friends in elementary school. I was one of her only friends and she was constantly in drama in elementary school.  We went to different middle schools, I would occasionally reach out but she never reached out to me.  In high school I would reach out occasionally and I think she did the same before Covid.  Over Covid I ran snacks and handwritten letters to her house and learning her friend group was crumbling I invited her to my friend group. Covid ended.  She didn’t invite me to hangout but her home life was pretty turbulent at the time. I also didn’t hang out with her at school because I felt like self conscious around her. She was in a ‘cooler’ crowd of friends and she would prioritize them. I didn’t ask her to hangout either.  Her home life got worse and she asked to move in with me. I asked my parents and they said “sure, if I can call her parents to let them know that Crystal is safe.”  She decided to move into another friends (my close friend I suggested) house because she was worried my parents would make her move back home. I think she was under 18 at the time.  I didn’t invite her to my birthday but invited close friend and his brother. Kind of a bitchy move but I felt like I didn’t know her. She texted me “why didn’t you invite me?”  I responded word dump style “ahh you lie to me! U bad person!! 😠😠” (paraphrasing but basically not the point. Asshole text right here that makes no sense to anyone.)  Near the end it felt weird to hang out with her and I don’t really want to rekindle that friendship but I do want to apologize.   TLDR: Would I be the asshole if I apologized to an old ex friend because of something I did, without the intent to befriend her again?\n",
      "Basically there’s a kid at my school who has a YouTube channel and some of the content on his channel is just objectively awful e.g 3 part series on his family washing their car , 25 part series on opening his Lego advent calendar, an interview with his uncle   Anyway I was sitting by him in a lesson and asked him wat he was getting for Christmas and he said a 4K camera for his YouTube. I then asked if he thinks he can go pro in YouTube and he said yes . I said that he could probably do with switching his content up and he said wat do u mean and I said to him no one finds a blog if his geography trip entertaining and he started saying that people said they enjoyed it (Ik for a fact that they were taking the piss saying this). I then told him that if he stays making that content will never go pro   AITA for saying that\n",
      "Throwaway because he knows my account.  So my boyfriend (27m) and I (21f) have been together for a while and things were really good. We were thinking of moving in together and then 2020 happened. Restrictions where I live have been lifted for a while now but I havent felt fully comfortable leaving to meet up with friends until now.  So I arranged to meet up with my friends the other day and to meet up with my boyfriend later that night. My friends and I lost the time and I went to his about half an hour later than planned. He was mad at me for being late and said I shouldve been more responsible with my time. I sent him texts but they didnt get through to him. I tried to apologise but he said that I was being an asshole. I ended up leaving his place to go back to my own flat.  Now hes being really curt when we're texting or facetiming and i dont know what to do because my friends dont think I'm an asshole but I was out with them, so strangers on the internet it is.   AITA? I'll apologise fully to him if I am.\n",
      "I'm a female university student. I signed up for my university's voluntary language exchange program. You get paired up with an exchange student who speaks the language you want to practice, and that person will be able to learn the local language from you. I'm learning Spanish and my pair turned out to be a Latin American exchange student, let's call him Diego.  We meet up for coffee near campus, we're talking about our language learning goals, how often our schedules would allow us to meet up to practice etc. After no longer than about 15 minutes, he tells me very sternly: \"I want to let you know that I'm only looking to make a new friend and learn a new language. Only friendship, no romance.\" I am confused as can be but I manage to say: \"Sure, that works great, that's exactly what I'm looking for, too.\" One would think that it was just a cheeky joke he tried to make, but I assure you he was very serious when he said it.  We were at the coffee shop for an hour but I just felt awkward about the bizarre \"no romance\" speech he had given me. I have a boyfriend I've been with for 4 years and I truly am not \"looking for anything\". I wondered if I had been acting interested or flirtatious, but I can't see how. I don't think I'm \"overly friendly\", I'm a little bit quiet and I feel like you would have to use a lot of imagination to think that I'm flirting with you when I'm not.  I'm supposed to message Diego later this week so we can arrange our next meeting, but I'm having cold feet about agreeing to be his language partner. He basically told me to \"not try anything\" 15 minutes after meeting me, and I think that's really strange behaviour when I certainly wasn't \"trying anything\". I feel uncomfortable with this guy and it is allowed to request a new partner if it doesn't work out with the first one. On the other hand, am I just being too sensitive? He might be overly confident but that doesn't mean that he can't be a nice guy and a good friend in other ways. And being a foreigner in a country where he doesn't speak the language, I'm sure he could use a friend.  AITA for considering requesting a new language exchange partner because of this?\n",
      "My fiance's parents and him and I have have had problems all throughout our engagement. They come from a culture that is very enmeshed. We are second and third generation Australian, and have different expectations. My fMIL has yelled, thrown tantrums, threatened to \"Kick me out of the family\", played silent treatment and gaslighting games- things like yelling at my fiance and calling him socially incompetent, saying things like I have a bad influence on her son, making him rude- then going on my social media and leaving lovey dovey comments. It is less problematic, but they are generally over involved and underestimate what my fiance can do- like my fMiL wouldn't let him do laundry in case he ruins it, she accidentally ruined the surprise of my proposal by continually messaging him on holidays if he'd proposed yet (I saw the message.) FBIL has been verbally abusive to me and my fiance- she got upset because I started low contact, saying I didn't have family values.  We moved out of our family home and in together a few months ago. Fiance has had regular interaction with parents, saying hello three to four times a week when he drops in to lift weights in his parent's garage. fMIL has been nagging him to have dinner, but he and I both with to discuss and not sweep issues under the rug. She texted me last Friday saying as she hadn't seen her son at all since he moved out, she wanted to resolve it this weekend. I replied the next day (just really busy) that we could talk on the phone.   Saturday night, we worked all day and we're resting in the backyard around 5pm. We live in a studio on the bottom of a three storey house, behind a locked gate, about 80m back from the road, and down three flights of stairs. We do not live in the main house, they that and they know we could not afford that. There is one doorbell. In Laws have not been invited over, we individually don't want them in our space.  FPIL rang the doorbell and had the landlord bring them down to our place. My fiance tells them immediately to leave. His father yells that he is rude and his mother starts loudly exclaiming that she is his mother, that we didn't answer the text (we did, just not immediately) so they decided to come. My fiance insisted they leave, so they did.   It's quite a trek up. I was upset that they don't respect my privacy and for I would have assumed was a common personal boundary. The texted my fiance that we are rude and disrespectful, that this cannot be solved on the phone, that they refuse to be treated like doormats and when we are ready to be adults they will talk. I said I expect them to respect my boundaries and call or text for confirmation ahead, and to never do that again. We haven't heard from them since. My friend agrees with them, and empathizes with fMIL, and says I have a duty as DIL to take care of their feelings. I don't see them in anyway empathising or apologising for hurting my feelings, in fact the opposite. Are we TA?\n",
      "So I’ve been living with my partner and roommate for about 6 months now. My partner and I rent this house, and allowed the roommate (who I have previously lived with) to live with us to help with costs, but not be tied into a lease with us and could leave whenever he wants. In the beginning of him staying with us, and occasional friend would come over and they would drink, which didn’t bother my partner or I unless they got too loud. For context, my partner and I work over 50 hours and a week whereas our roommate works about 20, and therefore stays up extremely late most nights whereas myself and partner are in bed by 10.   As of the last month or so, the roommate has beginning to have people over constantly. Mind you, he did just barely turn 21, and is in the major drinking phase to which he’s going out every night, pregaming at our house with friends, and bringing home friends to crash or girls to hookup with. In the most recent hookup, when the girl left in the morning, she left our front door open. We not only have cats, but a scorpion problem as well. She also preceded to come into my bedroom and spill an entire glass of water, prompting me to assume we had a water leak- as the roommate had no idea she had come into my room.  We have brought it up to him, just asking he actually give us notice when people come over, have people over less rather than every other night if not every night, and be more aware of the home as a whole when having random people come over. He has stopped having people over every night, but still occasionally had a random girl come over without any notice.  In addition, this dude drinks a lot. Yes, he just turned 21. But my partner and I are around the same age and aren’t getting shitfaced every night to the point where theres liquor spilled on the floor and broken shot glasses constantly, and the need to have people over to pregame every night with random people.   I guess my biggest issue is that this is my partner and I’s house, and we made it clear we didn’t constantly want people over. He agreed in the beginning, and is really receptive to us asking him to do / not do things, but i feel like an asshole asking him to never have people over. I’m just over worrying about random people in my house, doors being left open, and alcohol being constantly spilled.   So, AITA?\n",
      "UPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/user/BlazeCharizardite/comments/u70wo1/update_aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_isnt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  (Possibly) Relevant info: Ben does not own a car, so he relies on everyone else to give him rides to work, the grocery store, etc.   &#x200B;  This all happened on Valentine's Day. Ben(19m) and I(20m) rent a trailer together, and we made plans with Sasha(19f) for her to come over and drink some fun juice because none of us had valentines and wanted to be sad together. Earlier in the day I left to go hang out with Sasha at work, we all work at the same place, and when I got back around 11:30 pm Ben was gone. Sasha came over around an hour later and at that point, I wondered where he was so Sasha texted him. It turns out he walked to the gym on the other side of town and was asking her to pick him up. She had just come over so she told him that she didn't want to drive so soon, but that she'll pick him up when he was done with his workout. He told her that there were people at the gym and that he really did not want to be there. She told him once again that she did not want to drive right now but she would get him when he was done.  &#x200B;  While texting him she started feeling bad and asked me if she should get him. I told her that we help him all the time and had previously agreed not to go to the gym, so he put himself in the situation. I told her that she isn't obligated to give him a ride anywhere as it is her car and gas. (He never offers to pay gas money, and she and I are too afraid to ask for money. Mostly because he spends it all as soon as he gets it, so we would never see the gas money). I'll admit I could have offered to pick him up, but I did not want to for similar reasons. She and I were hanging out and he put himself in that spot. We have picked him up from random places a million times, and we just did not want to do this once.  &#x200B;  So, about an hour later he gets home and comes to my room going on about, how do I put this, that he really needed someone as he was going through it hard that night and no one came and that he was done with us. I can't use the exact word, but what he said is nothing that he told Sasha over the phone. We had no clue he was having such strong feelings, and had we known we would have gotten him.  &#x200B;  This is where the story may seem off as I have to figure out a way to word it where this post will not be removed. We'll say he got angry and said some things/did some things that were questionable. He does this all the time with me whenever I tell him no to something, so I no longer say no. Sasha was worried, and we couldn't leave the house as I had to go by where he was to leave.   &#x200B;  Sasha and I talked to him a day later and explained we could no longer be friends due to his behavior. He seemed to take it well, and I've worked with him to help him find professional help.   &#x200B;  Anyways, I've been feeling like this all could have been avoided if I told Sasha that she should pick Ben up. He wouldn't have felt alone, although we did not know, and he would not have reacted how he did.\n",
      "I broke up on relatively good terms, as good as they can get I guess, with my ex in August. During our relationship we bought some stuff together:   plates/bowl which are part of an ensemble. My ex also received a blanket as a gift, by me I believe, or my family.   After we broke up the stuff stayed at my place, and she didn't mention anything about it.   There was other stuff as well, but I basically gave it all to her. I only kept a book and a drawing. They remind me of the happy times and I like to reminisce.   So since she never came to pick them up, I started using them.  Now she messaged me saying she wants the blanket and the part of the plates/bowls she payed for (or that I have to pay for them).  That did it for me. I had been super nice about basically everything, and now after 3,5 months (and like 1month of relative silence) she comes back to collect the stuff. So I said, baffled, \"I find it quite ballsy that you ask me this now. I don't understand how you can care for this stuff if you only mention them now after such a long time\" and hurt I continued with \" if you still want the stuff I won't stand in your way, but if you do want to get them please buy my part of the ensemble because I think it shouldn't be separated. \"  I understand that the items are technically hers, but it somehow feels as an intrusion. In my eyes she had quite a big window to come and get them or talk about it, but she didn't. It's as if a stranger would walk into your room and claimed stuff you grew attached to.   Now she isn't answering. So I was wondering if IATA in this story.   TL:DR; Ex left her/our stuff at my place, I grew attached to the items and after 3.5 months (and 1month of relative silence) she asks if she can get them back, but I am reluctant to give them back.\n",
      "I share a bench with my coworker.he has been around for 10 years, and I joined 3 years ago. He hasn't been working on the bench for the past few months, and as a result I have changed the position of a few things around to make it easier for me- nothing has disappeared or been shifted elsewhere- everything is still visible but only mild spatial rearrangements have been made. He was informed every time and he didn't object.   He decided to work today, and I had some stuff lying out there from yesterday night- I was refiling some materials which are used by both of us. He flew into a total rage and yelled at me infront of everyone about how I'm leaving his workspace covered in shit. These were bottles filled with plastic parts, and when I began removing them he became even angrier and made a comment \"now you're making it look like it's so difficult for you to take them\". When I cleared them away he pointed out to other things I had done (changed the vacuum pump system but patching up an older but larger system for use) and said \"this is shit and it doesn't work\". When I showed him that it worked he started telling that why did I dip the pump inlet into his fluid.   He started saying stuff like \"you just leave everything dirty and horrible and can't do a single experiment\" and started saying that that \"even when you try to clean you're messing things up for me\"   I finally lost my temper and told him that I also work here, and he told me to get lost and find a new workspace because \"he was here first\" and I'm just disrespectful of him . This is not a policy in our lab and everyone equally shares workspace. I agreed and told him I'll work somewhere else when he called me an upstart and that I ruined his work.  After that he started opening drawers and showing me exactly how I have left things completely ruined for him (there was a metal chamber which was a few inches to the left of it's container instead of inside it's container)  I agreed to shift seats and move away from him. AITA? Is this being disrespectful of a coworker?\n",
      "I'm 28, my sister May is 31 and my sister Cam is 30.  One of my sisters (I will call her Cam) is a champion in one upping and having to be the centre of attention. She can't let anyone else have the spotlight and always has to one up everyone. For example, our sister (I will call her May) has type 1 diabetes. When we were kids Cam always acted like she had it too and had too and tried to do all the same monitoring as May. Recently May was able a monitoring device through the government where by she sticks a sensor on her arm and it detects her blood sugar and lets her phone scan it and display the information. I'm probably explaining it badly but this is what I'm talking about. Despite not being diabetic Cam keeps insulin on hand in case she needs it and also purchased the same device as May with help from our parents even though she doesn't need to monitor her blood sugar. Since Cam isn't actually diabetic the province doesn't cover the insulin or device so she or our mom and dad pay out of pocket.  When our cousin and then when May got married Cam wouldn't shut up about her own wedding planning even though she wasn't even engaged yet. Like there was no wedding on the horizon for her. I'm likely getting married soon and I don't even want to talk to Cam about it. When my uncle was in a car accident and had to be in the hospital and have surgery Cam went on and on about the time she fell off her bike when she was a teenager and it was the worst pain ever and how worried the doctors were. She was never hospitalized. If someone is pregnant Cam will always talk about how when she gets pregnant it will be so high risk she will be on bedrest in the hospital the while nine months. She doesn't have any medical problems and has never been pregnant before so there is no signs she would have a problem. When I got into university or if anyone else talks about school Cam brings up how her teachers said she was the most gifted child they had ever met. She was never in gifted classes and got average grades. But these are examples of her one upping. If someone is getting positive attention for something like a wedding, birth, promotion or graduation Cam always makes it about herself. She made herself the center of attention at our great-grandfather's funeral and tried to make it all about her.  My parents noticed that I don't tell her any details about life and I keep subjects light and only do small talk with Cam. They think I'm not being a good brother and should try to involve her in my life more like I do with them, May or other family members. I don't want to deal with Cam one upping or wanting attention. May is fed up too. She's a paramedic and especially during COVID gets lots of praise which Cam can't handle. My mom and dad say I need to let Cam be more involved in my life and won't leave me alone about it.\n",
      "My foster sister and I are both 16. She has been staying with us since august.  My Mom asks that I take her out sometimes when my friends and I go out. It’s annoying but my friends like her, so whatever.  Every time we go out though, she wears some tight or skimpy outfit. I catch my boyfriend staring at her, and all of the cat calling she gets is annoying.   My friends and I were going out to Dave n busters yesterday, and my mom asked that I take her along. She comes out in a fucking fashion nova two piece, and a face full of makeup. I told her to go change or she couldn’t come with us. She got really upset and ran to tell my mom. Then when my friends got there, she was acting all sad and told them what happened, and they called me an asshole.   She ended up going with us anyway, but I didn’t talk to her the entire night, and was annoyed the entire time she was there. One of my friends even invited her out tonight without telling or inviting me, really hurts my feelings. Why can’t she put on a sweater and jeans like everyone else? AITA for asking her to change? Like I feel like her outfit is inappropriate.\n",
      "Ok so my family clubbed together and bought me a thick-ish white gold necklace for my 21st.  I'm 26now, and it's really not my style anymore, it's been laying in my cupboard for about a year.  My idea is to talk to my family and ask if we can't pawn the necklace and get me a really nice watch or 2.  This way it gives new life to the gift, else it will just gather dust as I can never just sell it, that will be in bad taste.\n",
      "So I went on this road trip a few years back and was staying a week in this hotel. Couple guys and girls all around the same age. Of course we were all broke college students so we tried our best to squeeze as many people into as little rooms as possible. I had 4 people in my room, 3 guys, 1 girl. Of course the hotel fucked up our requests and we only got a queen bed and a small little cot. At first I was going to ask the girl if she wanted the cot so she didn't have to share the bed with 2 dudes, but the two other guys immediately devised a system where we rotate the cot every night, and she agreed to it so it worked out.   Things went well for the first few nights but then on about our 4th night one of the guys made an ass of himself. He got piss drunk, told the girl in our room that he loved her and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her, called her a slut when she rejected him, and then blew up at the other guy in the room for sabotaging his chances with the girl. He then had to be carried to our room and put in the cot, where he proceeded to vomit all over it.  The next day he was understandably awkward, but way too much to be fair, he was pretty much sulking and acting like we wronged him, avoiding the three of us all day. Then a girl from our group but in a different room came up to us and said \"it looks like I'm going to be sleeping in your room tonight\". I asked her what she meant and apparently the puke man told her he couldn't stand to be in our room with us, and that he wanted to switch rooms. I asked her if he told her he threw up on the bed before asking her and she said no.  So when the guy eventually wandered back to our group I spoke up and said \"why are you asking people to switch rooms\". He said that he didn't feel comfortable in our room anymore. I told him \"too bad, you puked in the bed, now you have to sleep in it. You're not going to make someone else sleep on your goddamn puke\". He flipped out and started saying how I was just saying that because I wanted to continue to share the bed with the girl. I told him \"No that's not it, because I'm not a fucking creep, unlike some people\".   That night the dude slept in the puke cot. The girl said to me loud enough so that he could hear, \"if you don't have enough room you can cuddle up with me\". I thought that it was a little insensitive but I was pissed at the guy still for calling her a slut and thought she earned a bit of revenge, so I said \"I think I will\" and then did. Puke man then said \"hey guys... fuck you\".  I told my friend this and he said I was an asshole. I said I may have been, but I thought I was a  justified  asshole. And really ultimately I feel like I was right that nobody should have to sleep on his vomit stain, and that the girl had a right to earn some revenge on the guy after being called a slut.\n",
      "Posting on behalf of a friend:  I have a four year old golden retriever/labrador mix who I absolutely love. I got engaged and decided to move back in with my parents to save money before the wedding. Unfortunately, my parents  said that my dog would have to live outside if he came with me to their house.   He is used to being an inside dog and I did not think he would be happy staying outside all the time. I ended up working it out with some friends for him to stay with them for a few months until I moved back out of my parents house.  They have a dog themselves so they were comfortable taking him in. I paid for any vet visits but he stayed there pretty much full time.   My fiancé and I are both college students though and all the pet friendly places were way out of our price range. I really tried to find a place that would work but it’s hard in a college town. Our friends seemed like they were really enjoying having our dog stay with them so I asked them if they would just want to keep him permanently.  They said no, two dogs was more than they want right now but said they had a family member who was interested in adopting my dog. They ended up rehoming my dog for me. I am heart broken for him to go but I felt like I didn’t have any choice. Some of my friends are saying I’m the AH for not keeping my dog. AITA?\n",
      "So I met this guy who is looking for a job. I met him when I was looking for an apartment, the time he was doing real estate hustle. So long after I got the apartment, he kept in touch. Told me his life story, Christian upbringing, nice guy. We texted for 2 years, eventually met a few weeks ago. He is still looking for a job, he asked me to share any job leads with him. First job I saw I sent him, he was interested but he doesn't have a passport, it's an overseas job. Well, I have a friend who was looking for a live in caregiver for her aging parent. So I asked her to give this guy a chance, so he can earn money, to atleast apply for the passport.  My friend agreed, asked him for his ID.  It showed a different age than what I told my friend.  She called me to verify that we are talking about the same person. Sure enough, the ID shows that the kid is 23! He told me he was 32! I confronted him, he started giving flimsy excuses, first it was a discrepancy between his birth certificate and the ID. I said well, what does the Birth certificate say? He said 1998. Then I asked, what year were you born, he said 1993! Even that still doesn't add up to 32 I pointed out.  All this time he was laughing, which was quite irritating to me. I asked him, if you are lying about your age, what else are you lying about and can you be entrusted with the care of someone's loved one? He didn't have an answer. I asked him, did he understand the repercussion or magnitude of his lie? He didn't answer except continue giving explanations that made no sense.\n",
      "This happened a few months ago before lockdown happened and we all were sent home from university. I used to have a stutter that still comes in occasionally and rhotacism (the inability to pronounce the 'r' sound: I sound like a less severe version of the priest from princess bride). I'm well aware that I sound a little bit ridiculous but I've had it my entire life and people don't tend to make comments on it very often now that I'm older.  I met up with a study group for one of my classes for the first time to get ready for a presentation and I didn't know most of them. We were talking over what we were going to do for the test and just sort of getting to know each other because it was the first meeting. One of the guys noticed how I was speaking and mimicked it a bit whenever he spoke directly to me. I don't normally care because it does happen without people realising sometimes and it's really nothing compared to what some people have done.  We were splitting up who was going to work on what and he asked, very bluntly, if I had to talk in the presentation because I might bring down our mark because I sound stupid. I actually have something in place that stops me from being marked down and previously for presentations and things I'd get 'consideration marks' (don't know if that's the proper term) if it stopped me from fulfilling part of the  markscheme (usually we're assessed on our words being 'clear and concise' which I struggle with). I also email my teachers when classes start so that they know in advance and I normally don't need to go through the official channels to get my marks which saves everyone time.  I told him that and he scoffed and said that the 'some of us had to work to get those marks' which really pissed me off and I replied that 'some of us have speech impediments'. I guess he didn't know that it was an actual thing that was making me sound like that and he got very awkward and defensive. We all sort of split off into our own little groups and the presentation was called off because of covid. I thought that was the end of it but when trying to meet up with some of the people to form a study group in September, they said that since I made the study group last term so awkward that they would rather work with other people.  I genuinely didn't think that I was in the wrong but this has made me second-guess it.\n",
      "My coworker/ kind of friend is getting married. We aren't particularly close in my opinion but I've helped her out a few times, the most memorable being when she got in a car accident and I picked her up and made sure she got home okay. But I've never hung out with her outside of work and we don't even really talk outside of work either.  She's getting married in the spring and my girlfriend and I are on the fence about going. I would only know one person besides the bride at the wedding and my girlfriend would only know me. I also know that she and her friends like to party HARD and I would feel uncomfortable being around a bunch of really wasted strangers. Finally, the wedding is in the south (we live in the Midwest) so I would most likely have to take off at least one day of work and pay for airfare and a hotel.  Sounds like an easy no, right? Well she told me that they're keeping the wedding very small and only inviting their good friends. I feel guilty since she chose me for one of the few and she could have invited someone else. Plus she takes things to heart pretty easily so I'm afraid it would damage our friendship and work relationship. I don't know if I should say yes just to be polite.  Please tell me WIBTA?  Edited to make it more anonymous\n",
      "I do believe the majority has voted me asshole therefore I will be leaving the cats alone.   Context: I lived in my parents apartment basement when I was 18 until my devil sister moved back in with her shit husband and kids. My parents said they’d build me an apartment but I still had to share the basement with my sister. She & her husband were eventually such demons I decided to move to my parents part & my mom wouldn’t let me have my cats inside, so they stayed outside. My neighbor kind of took them on by feeding them and bringing them in for the winter. We never talked about it, she just kinda... did it? Like got a bed for my cats and everything? I’m very appreciative and I (again I have not discussed any of this with her) was going to just let her keep them but I miss them. My apartment is done and she’s had them for about 9 months. They’re mostly outside but she brings them in if it’s super cold and even referred to them as “her cats” when my moms dog got out and bothered them. I was going to bring them back in when the apartment was done anyways but now I don’t know what I should do. They still come over all the time and hang out in my yard but I want them back inside with me.  Edit: typo. Them* not hyphen Edit 2: more info. She knew they were my cats. We were both taking care of them. I thought she was just feeding them til my niece told me she was bringing them inside and had a bed for them. They don’t go inside unless it’s super cold because they don’t get along with her cat. I would also bring them in and had a heated shelter outside for them. I stopped feeding them at 6 mos because they are so fat now from eating from 2 sources but I recently started feeding them again. They come to both houses. I’m thinking I’ll talk to her and offer compensation for taking care of them so long but if she’s attached then I will probably just leave things the way they are and just pet them and say hi when they come over.\n",
      "ATIA for not adding a friend back on Snapchat. I can see how this sounds but there was a massive lead-up to me unadding her. We go to the same school (all girls I (F 16), her (F 13) ), anyways her and I became friends through mutual friends in her grade who I've known for longer. I added her on snap and we quickly became close friends, soon she felt like a little sister, and after a while, she started to trust me and she opened up to me about her past and her struggles. Soon after I realised she was a bit of a trauma dumper which at first I didn't mind because it was only a few things. She knew I was going through my own things and demons (still am but that's not the point), after a while I told her that I was sorry for not answering as quickly as she liked because I was focusing on my school work as I'm now in grade 12 and she went \"mhmm\" or \"k.\" I was getting spammed by her constantly on both messages and snap- to the point I muted her on messages but never blocked her, I never have and I never will and because I wouldn't answer as quickly she would ask if I blocked her and I told her no since I didn't and she starts saying to me \"lies.\" which annoyed me. This went on for months and after a bit, our mutual friends and my bf said \"she's being unfair to you stop talking or ask for space\" which I did so we gave each other space but she kept spamming me on snap to the point I would get in trouble with my teachers and parents for my phone going off so to stop that I unadded her. I didn't just unadd her because she was spamming but because she would constantly degrade me and call me a liar, a fake friend, tell me I don't care about her (I do care about her) and many other things that aren't true. There's been a couple of times when one of our friends has talked to her about me since my bf reached out and told her to, she made me cry so many nights in a row because of the degrading and her behaviour and our friend talked to her in general after I told her some things because she saw how it affected me.  &#x200B;  She started spamming me on messages but I didn't answer because 1- we were giving each other space and 2- we would start arguing about me adding her back. The other night I was talking to her again and asked if we could sort things out in person and stuff and she kept coming back at me and saying \"add me back on snap\" and I kept saying no or \"give me some time to think about it\". She would say to me after a while a couple of times \"have you had \"time\" to think about adding me back yet\". I had loads of people telling me \"don't add her back just so she stops arguing with you\" but I had a few people say \"Just add her back\", I haven't added her back yet but Im gonna talk to her in person in a couple of days. AITA?  &#x200B;  Side note- She became super attached to me and copied my behaviour and how I dress e.g wore her school skirt the same length as me, always talking about me and even wore the exact same outfit as me to a youth group we go to.  P.S sorry this is so long and I have never heard her side only from other people just saying she misses talking to me and I do to but I don't want to talk to someone if all we do is fighting\n",
      "My mom was not the best person and she did drugs in highschool and a little bit into her early 20's. So when my great-grandfather passed away my mom was devastated when she heard the news, she was very close to him. At the inheritance reading 20,000 was to be split up between my Aunt and my Mom. My greedy Aunt complained and said that my Mom was not fit to have the money because she was doing drugs, even though she was 3 or so years clean. So she went to court and she got my mom's part of the inheritance.  Fast Forward 6 years my Aunt is pissed that my family won't come to her birthdays and other family gatherings. She has convinced my family that my mom was a druggie who tried to get the money from HER!  The only reason she might be correct is that my family deserves to know who my sister and I am.  Am I the Antagonist for not letting the rest of my family into my life?\n",
      "I have pretty good sized group of friends, one of these friends is Lee. We mostly talk online in group chats since not all of us can always meet in person, however, Lee claims to have a boyfriend whom she hangs out with a lot. After some thinking, I've realized that Lee's boyfriend is not real. I realized this because:  She would send us pictures of texts that her and her \"boyfriend\" would send each other, but I have came across an app that can fake text messages, which looks like the images she was sending to us. She would show us pictures of them together but they have something blocking their face. After I found some of these photos on Pinterest, all being taken from way before their relationship had started, I realized the truth.  She told most of the friend group that she had broken up with her \"boyfriend\" because she had feelings for someone else. We all supported her through this . Through all this one of our friends, we'll call Vinnie, was her shoulder to cry on. However, she suddenly realized that she actually loved him.  When Lee tried to get with him, he made a good point. While Vinnie hinted that he might feel the same way to her, she was going through boys at a fast rate. He was concerned about all of this and told her to take a break from romance so she could clear her head. Lee agreed to the break, but about a week in she just decided to go after him again and see what he said. Vinnie then told her to stop.  Some things about her life are fishy, like her winning specific competitions one day and then later she'll come over to the group and say she won it again.  I told her that I realized that her stories about her boyfriend and other life events are just blatantly not true. I told her the danger of building friendships on lies and how damaging it can be to everyone involved, including her. I told her I wouldn't tell anyone else, and that she could come to me with anything.  In response to this she then said that the pictures were actually taken by her and her boyfriend and were of different people, (which doesn't explain the date it was uploaded), and that she very much has a boyfriend. She then didn't respond to anything else I said.  All day I've been feeling bad for calling her out on this but then I realized some things about all of this that I'm only now thinking of because I had to go through my entire friendship with her. She seems to enjoy bragging about her relationship to my girlfriend and I and usually with tease us about how she can actually be physically with her boyfriend and will then go into detail through all of the  stuff they do together. She also has a history of spreading gossip and lies throughout the group which has caused people to burn bridges with each other that have been extremely difficult to rebuild. With all of this I have come to the conclusion that my friend is a possible psychopath, or someone who needs help.\n",
      "My brother (47M) and I (43F) are both retiring from the military after 20 years on the same day, roughly 8 months from now.  The military has a program that allows separating/retiring members to spend a portion of the last 6 months of their career in an unpaid internship with approved companies while still on active duty.  This internship can be with any company vetted by the military, and is designed to help folks transition to civilian life.  I have two friends who work at two different companies in an industry that has been a hobby of both my brother and I since we were children.  Company A is a large, prestigious company, even folks who don't participate in the hobby have heard of their products.  Company B is a smaller, less well know company with a proven track record of success in the industry.  I have spent the past 2 months working with the Company B to participate in the internship program there and I it should be finalized in the next week or two.  There is no guarantee the internship will lead to a job but they did promise me an interview at the end of it.  This is an amazing opportunity for me to break into an industry that would literally be my dream job.  A few days ago my brother called me and asked me for the contact information for my friend who works at Company B, as he wanted to see if he could do the same thing I am doing and maybe get a job there.  I told him I could talk to my friend at Company A, who is also hiring for this position, and I also told him to check with the website of the program offered by the military, as it lists thousands of other companies who are approved to participate in the same program.  (Brother was less concerned about the industry and more enamored of the fact that the job is 100% remote, there are lots of jobs in the program that are 100% remote.)  I did everything I could to steer him away from the job I am trying to get, while still supporting him in his efforts to find work after retirement.  Fast forward a day and my mother flat out told him to stop asking me for the contact info for Company B as I wasn't giving it to him because I didn't want to compete with him for a job.  Now my brother thinks I am an asshole for not sharing because \"there could be more than one job opening at Company B.\"  He isn't wrong, and there could be more than one job, but I feel like he is just trying to piggyback off of all the work I did, and possibly at my expense.  Maybe I should have just given him the info and let the best man win.\n",
      "So basically yesterday I was hanging out with a group of friends and there were three friends in my car and my other friend was in his car by himself. As we were getting on the high way his car battery died so he was stuck by the entrance on the high way. However, I was infront of him and I didn't even realize what had happened until I was well on the highway.  Once he called me and told me what happened I asked him if he was good and all that and then asked if he had jumper cables (he didn't and neither did I). It was at this point I realized if I went back to him I'd be doing jack squat to help him so I told him to either call his parents or triple A or someone who has jumper cables because I can't do anything.   During this time period though I was texting him like if he was good and if he found someone and I told him don't stand around on the side of the shoulder so he doesn't get clipped (basically enough to show that I atleast care). However he wasn't responding to me because he thinks I ditched him and left him in the dust.  Am I the asshole for not going back to him?  Btw anyone who's curious, about a half an hour later another friend came to him and took care of the battery.  Edit: in regards to the \"basically enough to show that I atleast care\" thing, I genuinely did care I didn't mean to sound like I was fake caring\n",
      "This is my first time using reddit, I hope I can reach a wide range of people to get a variety of advice   My husband and I have been married for a year now. We are both in the military and our jobs can be long and arduous and tiring. He likes to casually drink alcohol and it’s never really been an issue because he doesn’t get belligerent when he is drunk, which is actually on rare occasions. I can tell he hates his life right now and I have already told him that I feel bad that I can’t do anything about it and he told me he wishes I wouldn’t say stuff like that. I get that it’s unhelpful but I just wanted to try and at least show him that I care in case just that could be helpful.   This is actually besides the point, just some background could be helpful. I am trying to be as unbiased as possible telling this story. He and I moved into a new house a month ago, and we have been financially exhausted and stressed. I feel the need to note that I have more money saved than he does, and recently he was in a car accident that sucked finances out of him and it has been hard to recover because of the move. I intentionally avoid coming across acting and feeling entitled to more relaxation because I am covering most utility bills/ groceries because I know he would do the same thing for me. Some more background: I suck at doing the dishes. I am a clean freak but I let the dishes in the sink build up a bit before doing them which is once a day at least. He is worried about cockroaches, and says things like “your parents coddled you too much” and that I need to grow up. Yes, regarding the dishes. I have a pet peeve of not being taken seriously or being thought of lowly or disrespectfully. It’s a perfect and definitely valid peeve to have, but it’s more of an insecurity so I am afraid that I am reading into it too much. When we were arguing about it, he tells me to “shut the f k up” because he has a bad temper and doesn’t want me to make him more mad by trying to talk about it. I’ve definitely told him to f k off before but not as often as he cusses at me. I know this is a lot of information but I’m still afraid I’m not giving enough context. One time he and I were arguing and he asked me what I wanted, I said “no not right now you’re not taking me seriously” and he laughed and kept asking me but I really didn’t want to share what it was that I wanted because I felt like he was just gonna get mad and not listen to me. I’m making him sound like an awful person but I guess that’s because I am only bringing up his qualities that are troubling me.\n",
      "So I was originally dorming in an apartment. This was close enough to the school where I can walk or take the bus. Anyways, after school ended I went back home as well as my roomate.  There are three other housemates who decided to stay at the apartment. The internet would have been cancelled a month ago. But, they were still residing in the apartment so it wasn't cancelled. My reasoning is that because they are the reason the internet subscripton hasn't been cancelled, they should be the ones paying for it. It feels like I am paying for them to have internet.  Things are pretty similar for the utility bills. I haven't used any gas or water but they still expect me to pay a portion of it.   I am not completely sure why they want me to pay part of the internet bills this month. I think the reason for that was because I was part of the internet plan subscripton when I was there and I am still part of the lease.  Edit: I am still paying my part of the rent. The utlity bills are for the gas and water\n",
      "*half of market value  I'm 22f, my sister is 29f. Dad passed away when I was 15 or 16, and we were left his house in his will. We each legally own half of it. It's very big, has a huge garden, and is in one of the most expensive parts of the country. While I've not had it evaluated yet, based on looking at similar houses online, it's worth a fuckton. There's a similar house in our area that's up for sale for around 1.5 million, and another up for over 2 million.  I managed to get into a nearby university, so at 19 I moved into dad's house. I am planning to do my postgrad at this uni. I work a part time job to cover expenses and I'm on a very high intensity course at one of the best unis in the country. I cannot take on any more hours at work due to the intensity of my course, and would not be able to do any of this if not for dad's house being so close by, because I cannot afford rent anywhere else nearby.  Meanwhile my sister met this guy and they ended up moving into dad's house with me. They immediately got stable jobs which they've been in since they moved here 3 years ago. They got married in December and now my sister is pregnant. They've been asking me about moving out since January as they intend to make this home their family home.  I've said if my sister needs me out then I need her to buy me out. I said I'd get someone to evaluate the house, and I need close to what they suggested, which based on research, will be anywhere between 750k and 1mil for my half. My sister is outraged at this, I've told her it's an estimation based on similar houses, but considering she expects me to permanently move out of a house I own half of, I want half of it's value. Neither she nor her husband have that kind of money and having just paid for their wedding and with a baby on the way, they won't get it any time soon. I've also said we could sell the house and split the money, but she wants to keep the house.  Look, I know we've lucked out here, and by asking for more I'm being a brat, but if I were to move out with no financial compensation, then I'm fucked. Without this house, I cannot afford to live in the area. Moving out means not being able to do my course, or my work experience, and makes my postgrad impossible.  I have no clue what dad would have wanted because we didn't know him. We were aware of him, he's on our birth certificates, but he was never involved with us.  Mum, however, is also upset with me, saying I'm asking for an absurd amount especially considering the wedding and baby, that I should be ashamed of myself, and that given I agreed to live with a couple who are settling down, I should have seen this coming and prepared myself to just walk away from the house and leave it to my sister and her husband. Mum is now not speaking to me, and I've gone from feeling like I'm right to feeling like a spoiled brat.  AITA for wanting half the worth of the house?  Info: I have suggested some sort of payment plan if they feel that strongly about keeping the house, such as paying me some form of rent or mortgage in the form of a small lump sum to help me out when I move out and then regular installments until they pay it off but they've said that they won't do that just on principal because this is dad's house that she owns half of, and they maintain that they wouldn't be able to get an initial lump sum to help me move out any time soon due to the wedding wiping out most of their savings and them needing to start diverting their disposable income to the nursery/incoming baby.  &#x200B;  Update: I read through most of the comments, did some additional research of my own, and then this morning I said to my sister and brother in law that they had 2 options:   get the house professionally evaluated, and get a mortgage on the house to pay me whatever half the evaluation is, but this needs to be done through the bank and through lawyers and if it's anywhere near my estimations they'll be paying it off for decades  agree to sell the house. As a 50% owner I could force a sale myself, in which case we'll have to go through the courts and will probably get way less than it's worth, but if they cooperate we can get a proper evaluation, go through a real estate agency (or even do it ourselves) and get more money then we would if I had to force the sale, at which point I take half and my sister takes half (also done through lawyers) and she can get a smaller place locally that would still fit her growing family.   They weren't happy about it, and I got a phone call from mum soon after, but I've held firm that these are the only options I'll consider and it looks like they've realised selling and walking away with half is their best option. They might still look into a mortgage because my sister does seem to really like this house, but based on my calculations, there's no way they can afford a mortgage of this level unless something changes in terms of employment for them.  &#x200B;  Update #2: They agreed to sell. They don't want to do it for a while yet, as my sister doesn't want to move until after the baby is born and I said that as my postgrad finishes in May 2021, at which point the baby will be around 6 months old, we could all free up some time to start the selling process then. Selling the house could take months, even years, which we're prepared for, and as I'm going off an adjusted price the house could increase in value significantly by the time we're ready to sell. My sister apologised for being \"greedy\" (her word, not mine) and it sounds like she and her husband have gone away, looked at their finances, and realised they don't want the house bad enough to pay that much for it, especially when they could get a house that meets all their needs in this area for way less than their estimated half of the sale. Again, I'm consulting a lawyer just in case she tries something, but she seems genuinley regretful and willing to sell. Additionally, I've made clear that as they can't pay the mortgage on my half of the house, if they change their minds on selling, then I will force a sale myself and we'll end up getting way less than what the house is worth, which wouldn't be a big deal for me as I only need enough to rent a small flat and anything else is just a bonus, but they need enough money to buy a family sized home, so they want to do a sale we've all agreed to so they can get as much money in this as possible.\n",
      "My (m25) brother (m28) has always had a tough time with money. Mostly because he cant hold a job for more than a few months before either getting fired or because the company wont renew his contract.   During one of his times as unemployed he asked me to borrow him some money for rent (around 600€). Me and my brother usually had a great relation to eachother so i borrowed him the money. He paid it back almoast 5 months later.  7 months ago he asked me the same question and since he had payed me back before i borrowed him the money once again. The next month he asked to borrow 200€ more and the month after that 150€.  Almoast 4 months ago he got a job and told me that he would pay me back when he got his money but then told me that almoast all of it got spent on bills since he hadnt been working a full month. Since then he always say the same thing \"ill pay you back next month\". I've told him that he dosnt need to pay back everything at once and that mayby 200€ a month is enough.   Last month I asked him again for the money and he told me \"You already have enough money so you dont have to keep pestering me about paying back, you dont need it\". I told him that i BORROWED the money and that it wasnt a gift and that if he wouldnt pay me back he shouldnt bother by contacting me again since i just feel like i am his personal bank. I also told him that if he didnt pay me back i would make sure i got my money back by selling the debt to a company that would instead take stuff from him.   I've seen him buying games, pizza and energy drinks not just once a week but almoast all of the time (we live in appartments almoast next to eachother).  My parents called me and was furious by what i told my brother but I wouldnt let it go.   AITA?\n",
      "My (16m) mom has been making me stay home and cater to my little sister (14f) and her plans, My sister makes plans for her boyfriend to come over and confirms them with my mom. (she always says yes, always.) I have no problem with her boyfriend coming over, hes sweet and calls me the ‘cool big brother’ which is nice, but my mom has a rule that no boys are allowed over if she’s at work. (She works from 8:30 to 5pm most days) recently that rule has changed to no boys unless me or her is home, when I never agreed to it, so now after many, MANY of my plans being forced to cancel because im forced to babysit my sister and her boyfriend while my mom is at work, should I be able to ask her for babysitting money? We’re talking the entire day of not being allowed to leave the house, invite my friends over, or anything. I just think it’s unfair I should have to cancel all of my plans every time and get nothing back for it but an argument of why I should have to do this for her :/  I do think im TA because it seems like im just being greedy and I should put up with it because they’re family, but I really don’t want to, I feel like im just a babysitter/cleaner/stranger in their house 24/7.\n",
      "I live in Ohio. No, I do not live on a farm. No, I do not live near a farm. I live in a suburb of a large city with a medium-sized yard, same for my neighbors.   When the pandemic began and maybe 1/3 of my state took it seriously, I noticed a lack of eggs at my local grocery stores and in my subsequent panicked state I did all the research necessary to legally acquire and maintain chickens. The next week, eggs were back in full supply so I let my chicken-cultivating dreams fade. What this man is doing is not by our city’s chicken ordinances.  Neighbor took up a covid-pastime of raising/having chickens. At least 8 chickens, I don’t know they all look vaguely similar but they are many and one very loud rooster. Most egregious is having a rooster, which is specifically banned for reasons beyond being noisy. Only 3 chickens are allowed on one’s property, they must have adequate roosting space and a designated run for them to chicken run around in. He built a chicken-shack that is not large enough for his army, and lets them run free. By free, I mean into my backyard. Into my front yard. Into my garage. Underneath my car. I expected to find a chicken in my living room any day.   After the 8th day of removing his wayward chickens from my yard and asking him to stop the poultry madness, his lack of being a conscientious chicken lord led me to report him to city hall.   His chickens and rooster have been removed, but now everyone hates me. I wasn’t aware that he was providing eggs to the multitude of starving families who apparently will never see eggs or any other food again because of my actions.   I normally wouldn’t care (edit: that they don’t like me), however I supplement my income by using my 4 wheeler and plow to clear people’s driveways for way cheaper than a plow service. They’ve all told me to stop and that they’ve found a better service.  The chickens were really lovely, not the rooster, they always accepted their relocation back to the neighbors yard and carrying them was fun. But the whole situation was neither healthy nor safe for them.   AITA?  Edit: I wrote this two weeks ago but forgot to post after getting the covid and spending most of my time sleeping. I’ve since been informed by my non chicken harboring neighbor that he actually didn’t provide eggs to anyone in the neighborhood, but told everyone who would listen that I killed his dog. He never had a dog.  Second edit: I have to reiterate that I do not live on or near a farm. I live in a puckered asshole neighborhood where the city comes once a year to check if we have any peeling paint etc so they can fine us. My backyard is 10x15 and half of that is asphalt driveway. My neighbor’s isn’t much different.\n",
      "So my girlfriend and I both currently are non-smokers. Anyhow she and I both had some time in the past years where we smoked. I did it only on a few occasions when I spent a year abroad and she did it for some time when she was out with friends, at partys etc.  Since we came together I told her that I wouldn’t like it if she smoked, because my grandmother died from smoking related lung cancer a few years ago.  I really feel bad for the times I smoked in the past and think it was extremely stupid. But I made the decision to never smoke a cigarette again.  Now my girlfriend told me that she sometimes feels a sudden urge to smoke and asked me for my opinion on it. It told her truthfully that I would really dislike it because of what happened in the past. She then told me that I should not restrict her in that way. Also she brought up the argument that she doesn’t restrict me on drinking at a party or spending the night with my boys.  Now I am asking myself if I’m the Asshole for trying to keep her away from smoking.  Edit: To clarify, I guess if she would start again, she would start smoking like she did in the past, e.g. at partys or when she’s out with her friends.\n",
      "Ever since I was little, I’ve loved rainbows. The basic red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet type. My wardrobe when I was little was extremely colorful.  Today, I still love rainbows and love to incorporate that into my home decor and outfits. I’m cis and straight, so my rainbows aren’t connected to LGBTQ, though I do support them.  While out shopping with a few friends, a new girl in the group mentions how brave I am for wearing rainbow in public when it isn’t even pride month. My sweatshirt had rainbow stripes. I informed her I was straight, and she seemed to be fine with it. Later however, I receive a text from her telling me I shouldn’t be wearing rainbows if I’m not apart of LGBTQ. She said it would leave people to believe I like women, and in doing so lead them on. I’ve thought about it, and can’t decide if I should stop or not.\n",
      "This has been sitting on me for awhile and I need a third party opinion.   Minor background includes the fact that my (22F) flatmate (26F) is a very heavy sleeper and doesn't have an alarm system. This means that every night before bed, she manually sets her alarm for the next morning, and it's that \"fire alarm\" sound at the highest volume. When I asked her why she doesn't schedule a weekly alarm, she shrugged and said she likes this better.   About a year ago now, my flatmate and I were counselors at a week-long summer camp in the woods. After the kids were in their cabins for the night, the counsellors would usually congregate in our personal meeting hall and play some card games, drinking games, whatever. During this time, my flatmate used me as an alarm because she always snoozed hers and would be late to the morning meetings if I didn't wake her up.   One night, I turned in early and skipped the drinking, but woke up at 5am to the sound of my flatmate climbing into the top bunk, giggling and obviously wasted. we were sharing a room with 6 other counsellors, and I heard a few of them wake up too, because she's not a quiet person.  I go back to sleep and my alarm wakes me up at 7. Her alarm doesn't go off. I get ready, then push her a couple times, like normal, to wake her up in time. When she doesn't respond to me trying to wake up, I make a moral judgement. I leave her sleeping. At 11am, a full four hours into the camp day with everyone wondering why she's still asleep, I send someone else to go back and wake her up. She emerges, crumpled and bloodshot, and laughs it off and immediately says, \"well, OP didn't wake me up so it's her fault.\" I was pissed.   When I asked her later, in private, wtf was up with that...turns out she wasn't joking! she was too drunk to remember to set her alarm but thought I would wake her up. when I explain that I tried to but she was dead asleep, she said I was \"such an asshole for letting her keep sleeping.\" I brushed this off as her not being able to take responsibility for her actions, but have always second guessed that because, yes....I had been reliable in waking her up before and I definitely could have tried harder to do so.   so, AITA?  tl;dr: flatmate relied on me for waking her up in the morning at camp, I became petty when she woke the rest of us up at 5am wasted, and didn't wake her up that morning. She blames me for embarrassing her in front of the whole camp.\n",
      "I (29) am severely visually impaired, to the point that I can never legally drive a car.   In 2006, after a lot of hard work to prove that I was a responsible teenager, I got a guide dog when I was two years younger than the minimum age the guide dog school set for applicants. I want a perfect handler but I took great pride in maintaining an excellent level of training, care, and trust with the animal that was my best friend and hero. Over the course of nearly a decade together, I had to deal with people who didn't understand the rules of service dogs and overcome lots of other struggles on top of managing a disability.  Last August, my wife and I had to put him to sleep. he enjoyed 4 good years of retirement in luxury after he was unable to work, but it was still a traumatic experience.  Before my dog retired, my sister (38) with bipolar disorder saw the attention and praise and support my dog and I got as a result of our high standards of care and teamwork. I know firsthand how helpful a dog can be, and since she suffers from anxiety and.ptsd, I understood the benefit she could gain from a dog. But I also cant help but think her decision to get a dog was primarily driven by a desire for attention.  My sister adopted a shelter dog with severe behavior issues and did not achieve much in the way of obedience training. She tried to claim this was a Service Dog but it was not trained to provide any service based on any disability she has. At best, he was an emotional support dog by only the loosest definition. He is aggressive, barks at any movement he sees outside, and doesn't follow any commands.   The month my dog died, my sister got a third noise complaint from her landlord about her dog's barking. She was told to get rid of him or be evicted. On top of that, she refused to be there for me when we were putting my dog down because of a stupid argument she was having with my parents.  Two weeks after my dog was gone, she have hers to my parents. It made me feel betrayed, like my dogs passing meant nothing to her. my parents are in their 60s and can't handle the 80lb wolfhound mix so he just barks and they can't do anything about it and they don't want to get rid of him.  I am currently visiting family for the holidays and the last week has been very irritating. The dog barks constantly, has jumped on me and my wife, snapped at me for bumping into me, and other stuff that is just wearing me down.  I don't like this dog. It represents the bullshit my sister pulled and that my parents are letting it slide. It is 80lbs of proof that my sister was just trying to get attention. It is also just irritating to be startled by barking every 10 minutes. He has sweet moments, but  only between moments of being aggressive.  My parents, however, adore this dog. They are empty nesters and are willing to overlook his aggression because they paid his adoption fee for my sister at the shelter. Part of me also thinks they are using the new dog to cope with the loss of mine, who lived with them for a while after he retired since my building doesn't allow dogs and the Americans with Disabilities act doesn't cover service dogs after retirement.  Today we are visiting my sister and her boyfriend and I am not thrilled to be expected to pretend things are all fine and dandy again. My dog dying and her dumping hers on my parents has been the last straw. I love dogs, but not this one.\n",
      "I have been my girlfriend for about 3 years now. I’ve always done really nice stuff for her birthday. We eat at really nice places and do really fun things. I also usually get her some really nice gifts as well. I was planning on doing the same this year as well. That didn’t happen. So around a week ago my girlfriend and I were discussing working out and exercise and stuff like that. She is definitely in better shape than me. I’m not overweight, or at least I don’t think I am, but I’m not in as good of shape as I was when we first met. I was telling her what my plan was for working out. When I finished she said, “wow is that it? You really need to do more than that or else you’re gonna get even fatter. I didn’t plan on dating a cow.” I was pretty hurt by this. I’m usually not the most sensitive person, but this comment really hurt me. I got up without saying anything and left for a few hours. When I came back she was questioning why I left. I told her and she said I was being an immature jerk for doing that. She didn’t apologize once.   Well her birthday was the other day. I could tell she was excited about it. She asked me what my plans were to make her day special. I simply said “nothing at all.” She looked confused and laughed as if I was joking. She said come on now. I told her that it wasn’t a joke. She was really upset and started crying and asked me why I would be so selfish and stupid. She called me several names and said that I ruined her special day. She said that her friends or family don’t plan anything in that day now because they know I take care of it. I told her that if she wanted a special day that she shouldn’t call me names and harass me like she did. She left crying and went over to her parents. I got a call from that night. They were upset with me for ruining her birthday as well. Her friends have also said that I am in the wrong for what I did. Am I the asshole for doing that?\n",
      "I'm second guessing myself a bit here.  I have 2 coworkers, Mike (30ish) and Tyler (barely 18 ish), who wanted to go to a concert in the city on Friday. I get along with both of them, but we don't know one another that well, just friendly small talk conversation coworkers. Now, neither one of them have a car; they both take the bus or walk to work depending on the day, etc.  They invited me to go to the concert, but I wasn't feeling it as it sounded more like a rave than anything and while some people enjoy the party scene, I'm not too big on it. I declined the offer, but Mike asked me if I could drive him and Tyler to the show at around 9. It was unclear to me, and not specified that I would pick them up after as well.  I at first said no because I didn't want to go out of my way, but they kept asking me so I gave in; also because I ran out of ways to say \"no.\" and got guilted into it. I didn't ask for gas money and it wasn't offered. I dropped them off, told em to have a good evening and enjoy themselves, and went back home and then fell asleep around 1 or 2.  Around 4 in the morning, I kept getting texts from Mike asking where I was. I texted back that I was home and in bed and sleeping, and after several phone calls (that I didn't pick up) in a row from Mike and Tyler, I ended up turning my phone off.  Mike was rather upset with me after our next shift together and Tyler seemed upset too, but he's not the kind to confront anyone. Mike was mad I didn't pick them up and ignored their phone calls, because the bus stops around midnight and subway has its last run at midnight, and neither of them could get home and spent the night outside the venue until Tyler's ride picked them up in the morning.  I told him I didn't think I would be picking them up but Mike said that he wouldn't have asked me to drop them off if it was just a drop off. Now Mike is constantly speaking to me in a condescending or \"guilting me\" tone and Tyler will hardly speak to me and I'm starting to wonder if I should have just gotten up and driven them home, if not for Mike, but for Tyler. AITA?\n",
      "My son has bilatleral ulnar defiency, he has had between 14 to 17 surgeries between 2 to 16. He is 23 and is in his last year of college to be a social worker. His FASFA was denied, we don't know why yet. School starts next week and I have offered along with my step-dad to pay for the first semester. My husband (m37) is not very happy. I will be using my (f48) retirement money to help him. My husband is not my son's bio dad. My husband said my son needs to figure things out on his own and started to ball up his fists. I told him to stop bc I have been in abusive situations and I didn't like his actions. It's only $2000 dollars from my account and I can afford it. I told him when he was in college and Hurricane ANDREW hit,his parents didn't leave him in Florida, so it's no different. He gets very upset when I want to help my son with money. I feel it's causing a a strain on our relationship but don't know how to talk to him about it. I'm my son's mother first!

      "I just got into an argument with my mom about locking the bathroom door. I was sitting on the toilet doing my business and she comes and starts banging bloody hell on the door yelling to let her in.  I get out and she’s still screaming at me going on about how locking the door is unneeded and how she doesn’t care about how i look or what’s going on. And i just said that I need my own personal privacy and how IM th one who cares because i don’t want her to see me taking a shit. My family of 5 is living with my grandparents for a few weeks until our house is finished building and are on the different side of the house and it’s 12am and she basically woke up my 68 and 70 year old grandparents.

      "I'm out of town for work and sometimes make poor irresponsible choices that a \"good\" husband or father shouldn't make. I'm still faithful and love my wife and kids. I'm living with my wife's brother, his wife and her nephew. Bro in law went camping with his wife so it was just me and the nephew. We went to a local bar and I had a few beers, nephews 18 so none for him. A couple girls that work at the bar wanted to hang at a pool. The nephew invites them to the apartment pool and they came to the apartment after. Had some beers, joked around, even had another buddy come by. Nephew got kinda drunk and weird, but hes a kid. The girls eventually left and we went to bed. Nothing happened and I even told my wife everything, but shes pissed. I'm told by other husbands that you gotta lie to your wife to stay out of trouble, but that's not how I want to be. So shes not talking to me and I dont know how to handle this. Im flying home in 3 days for the weekend and I'm afraid I wont see her or the kids. I dont feel I did anything wrong and dont know how to prove to her that I care more about her than anyone else.  First vent on reddit, sorry so long.. I'm just hoping theres some wise person with a lil guidance.  Edit: I appreciate all the feed back from everyone and didn't expect so much so thanks everyone. Just wanted to clear up some stuff bout the underage nephew   yes he was drinking, and yes hes 18. My family believes that if you're old enough to die for our country then it's fair enough to have a couple beers, and I dont know of anyone who waited till they were 21 to drink. And I dont get wasted drunk, just casual drinking. So that's not the issue.  The girls.. they work at a restaurant across the street that we eat at a lot so my BIL and his wife know both of them and they aren't cocktail waitresses. Just servers there and just friends of ours. We all go in there regularly and know the owners and managers and have hung out with them away from the restaurant. The nephew is recently single and wanted to mingle and hes legally an adult so I'll keep him out of danger but I'm not going to tell him what he cant do sense I'm not his parent.    That being said, I agree with y'all IATA. And I'm working on my apology and begging for forgiveness. Thanks again everyone for not holding back and telling me how its, beautiful community here.\n",
      "I lost my arm 2 years ago and wear a prosthesis now. I've received a handicapped placard for parking, but I typically never use it. I always feel like I'm capable to walk like anyone else and there is probably someone in bigger need of this space than me. However, I've used it a few times recently when I was in a rush or there were no other spaces available. My rationale is that with a missing arm, it does take me much longer to do many things, and so this kind of compensates for lost time. Also, I was allowed to receive the permit in the first place. However, I still have a guilty feeling when I park in the handicapped spot, and that there will be an elderly person or someone in a wheelchair coming, and I took their spot. AITA?\n",
      "My husband is a combat veteran. The day before Veterans Day (11/10) a friend asked if I wanted to check out a new art gallery in town and have dinner on 11/11. Since 11/11 was Veterans Day I told her I would check with my husband and get back to her. That night I told my husband I was thinking of going to the gallery and dinner and he told me that sounded like a fun idea. The next morning (11/11) I got up and reminded him of my plans. He got extremely upset and told me he was too high and tired and didn’t remember that at all and that we needed to spend the day together. I told him I would only be gone from 4-6:30 and that if he really didn’t want me to go, that I wouldn’t. I took a shower and asked him what he decided when I got out. He said it was okay for me to go. At dinner, I ran into an old friend and wound up hanging out with him and his fiancé. We were having a great time so I called my husband and asked if I could stay longer and even invited him to join us. He didn’t want to join. I wound up staying out an hour and a half later than I originally told him because I ran into an old friend. Because of this, he told me I was selfish, made the day all about me, didn’t appreciate him and called me a liar. Also, this is our 4th Veterans Day together and we have NEVER done anything special. I always thank him for his sacrifice and service and tell him happy Veterans Day, and that’s it. We haven’t spoken at all today. So, AITA for going out after he told me I could and staying out an hour and a half later after running into an old friend and inviting my husband to join us?\n",
      "My partner and I are expecting our first born in November and couldn't be happier. My mum is currently living with us (my dad passed away recently) and plans to stay with us for a while once the baby is born. The reason she wants to stay is to be useful and hands on - it's definitely her idea and not ours, but we're grateful to have her do so. Recently, we signed up to parents-to-be classes. We like to be prepared and want to learn how to be more confident with a newborn.   While my mum is great with toddlers, she seems really unsure around babies. Growing up, I was mostly looked after by nannies and my mum or dad didn't really do much in terms of raising me (something I've resented but working through with therapy). She also lacks confidence with some things (e.g. holding a newborn) and has said as much. I am also an only child and it’s been 30+ years since my mum has been around babies. I should also add that she has an idyllic version of what it'll be like when a baby is around (e.g. wheel them around in the pram, play all day, sleeps easily). But I know there's a lot of work involved and we don't have nannies around like she did. My mum is also a bit clueless (e.g. as a baby she left me alone with an unqualified person and I went missing for a day, she also didn’t change dirty diapers).  I saw a grandparents-to-be class and both my partner and I thought it'd be useful. We thought it'd be fun for her and help us all be really confident with this new chapter. We suggested it to her last night (they were cheap classes and money wasn't really an objection). We talked about it a lot and we were insistent we thought it was a good idea. I also added that nannies aren't an option for us like they were for her. She became moody and very quiet as we spoke. She did not seem excited as we were.   I asked her why she was upset this morning and she brushed it off saying that she never discussed or planned so much. She thinks we are overthinking it and that in our culture (Indian, but my partner is American) there's no need to discuss as much. I get why she's saying this, but I'm frustrated she won't embrace the learning and understand that we're a different couple to her and my dad. I personally don't want to be the same as my parents and want to do better. Instead she just clams up and doesn't talk much. I get obviously frustrated and withdraw as well, unhelpful I know! Also, due to COVID, tensions are a bit high since we're all stuck together too.   So, AITA for discussing this with her and wanting her to be better prepared?\n",
      "Its more than just that, she was a shitty friend. Always put me down to any guys we would hang out with (we are both females). She would make fun of me, and then act like it wasn’t anything when i pointed it out. I’ve known this girl on and off for awhile, and we used to be really good friends years ago in high school. We reconnected about 3 months ago and hit it off completely. We listened, where interested in, and liked all the same things. Which is weird since I haven’t talked to her in about 3 years, and we have lived completely different life’s.   She had a really toxic boyfriend that she dated for 3 years, they both are completely inseparable. Somehow they always find a way back into each-others life. Which is sad because all they do is fight. They physically hurt each-other, and argue all night when they are together.   This was one of those times where he was in town and had already been trying to convince her to hang out for over a week. I didn’t want to hang out with him but we got convinced to go over their and hang out for a little bit. I drove there with another friend and the shitty friend. We hang out for a little bit and after an hour goes by I’m wanting to go back home. They start doing hard drugs and the friend i brought with me was addicted to them and did then without me knowing. So i got mad, and after 3 hours I told them that I was leaving. My other friend was so fucked up she couldn’t get off their couch and i just left.   I went back to my friends house (where i lived) and her mom asks me tons of questions on where they are and what's going on. The next 3 DAYS she stays over at his place. Doesn’t text me once to tell me what’s going on. Her mom is asking me what's going on the whole time. She messages me on the 3rd day asking me to pick her up from the bus stop. So i go pick her up. Afterwards she expected me to just stay home with her and act like nothing happened.   But I didn’t. I left at a friends house for 5 days. Tried to text her the whole time but she didn’t respond. We were supposed to go to a concert we planned for 3 months on the 5th day. But instead she didn’t text me the whole day, and went with her ex-boyfriend. At this point that breaks me because i feel like ive done so much for this fucking person and she doesn’t care about me at all.   I decided I was going to move out of her house. I text my parents(we are both 17 i moved out early) and ask them if they can help me move my things, they said they where coming that weekend so they would help. Turns out my parents forgot all about it. And my stuff has been over their for 1 ½ weeks, after a week when I was supposed to get it. Now I’m lost since I can’t fit all of my stuff in my car, even when lots of trips.   Yesterday her mom spammed messaged and called my phone, and honestly i haven't been reply back because i don't know what to say. I want to text her back with a plan of what im doing, but I don’t know what I’m doing.  Am i the asshole?\n",
      "TLDR at the end  Here's the thing. My colleague (let's call her A) is engaged to an US army soldier (let's call him B). To clarify: we're Germans and living in Germany. A called me one evening and told me that B had to go back to America because of the army for 2 months and that he left his dog Sam with her. Apparently B told her that his ex wife, who lives at the army base with their child, will take care of the dog. But after he left it turned out he didn't actually ask her and so A was left with the Sam. She didn't know what to do, since she is a single mom and lives in an apartment with her parents, her child and her brother. But: both, A and B had known for months that B had to go back to America for some time, so they had plenty of time to make plans. So, when she called me she told me that she can't take care of the dog and asked me to take him because I myself have two and she didn't know who else to ask. Of course I wanted to help her and agreed to take care of him for a couple of days until she and B find another solution. I still live with my parents too, but I could convince them to let me help my college for a limited amount of time. First, A was thankful and agreed to accompany the walks with the dogs and brought Sam's leftover food, which was definitely not enough for the time he already spent here and probably will spend. Also B didn't want to cover up for Sam's food, so now I have to pay for one more dog. With the time, A kept becoming more distant too, didn't join the walks anymore, didn't offer help, didn't ask how Sam is doing, etc. Also, we had been thinking about other solutions together and found some, but they all cost money and B doesn't want to pay anything (by not anything I mean literally nothing) even tho we found a really cheap solution too. Sam is a good boy and I like him lots, but I just can't keep paying and taking care of one more dog for 2 more months as I am very busy with work (we're nursing students), my own dogs, my cat and my sheep. Also I know that B isn't treating Sam well, I know that he keeps him in a box all day and feeds him pizza and ice cream, so he is obese and probably has diabetes (he drinks 2 liters of water a day, which definitely isn't normal). He doesn't have any endurance. He's been with me for 2 weeks now and his condition became better from day to day and he also lost weight. I want to help him and I feel bad for Sam but at the moment I just feel like B didn't really want him anymore in the first place and will use the possibility to get rid of him. As much as I like Sam, I just can't keep him. Of course I don't blame A, as she has to deal with a lot at the moment, too. But I feel like I have helped a lot already since we only agreed that I take him for a few days and it's been weeks already. Also B is probably going to stay even longer. Would I be the asshole if I asked A to take Bs dog back?  TLDR: college called me and asked me to take her fiances dog for a few days, left me alone with him for weeks.\n",
      "I made an order for delivery a couple weeks back. Since I didn't want to have it come to my house, I asked my friend if he would be okay with the order being shipped to his house. He was okay with it and told me he would be fine accepting it on my behalf.  The day the shipment was updated to have entered the country, I contacted him telling him that it was most likely coming the next day and he acknowledged what I had said.  The next day, he's in school with me and I tell him that according to the postal service website, it would take 2 days instead of 1 for the delivery to be made and tell him that it may or may not be arriving. Couple hours later, he receives a message which says, \"There was a delivery for John Doe here. Does anyone know a John Doe?\". So apparently, he didn't tell anyone at home that there was a package delivery being expected with my name on it and so the delivery person was told that there was no person by my name who lived there.  Now, the package is en-route to sender because the postal service doesn't have the authority to hold it. If I want it asap, I have to pay a retrieval fee of $21.40. So I'm obviously pretty angry because I already payed like $25 for shipping the first time round. I ask him to give me half the money because he didn't live up to his end of the agreement and notify anyone at home. When I asked him why not he said that it was my fault because I told him that the postal service website said it would take 2 working days.  I'm still asking him to pay me half the price before I have to go collect the thing and have made it pretty clear that I am pissed off at him. AITA here?  Edit: Not trying to evade the judgement that I ATA .  When I was placing the order, it was in front of him. I told him he could say no with zero effect on our friendship and I would ask someone else. He did say yes but specifically asked me leave my name on it. I expected him to understand what could happen if he wasn't at home but he didn't consider that possibility. I would be fine leaving it be but I'm pretty sure that if the tables were turned, he would act the same way.  Also for those concerned about the legality of what I had ordered, it was not juul or anything illegal it was energy drinks.  Edit 2:  In case anybody would wonder why I wouldn't want energy drinks shipped to my house, its because I don't want to share them with my family. Sounds a-holic but I need my caffeine.  Edit 3:  I accept the judgement that IATA. As of this point in time, I have talked it out with my friend and we're cool.\n",
      "Long story short, my (M 29) mother who is a severe alcoholic recently signed a divorce settlement where she received around $250,000. Yesterday during a check-in phone call I asked/suggested that she update her will  in order to reflect her settlement.  Now, my reasoning for this is that she is in her 60's and not in the best of  health due to her alcoholism, and having a current will seemed to me  like a good idea. I have never had expectations of any kind of financial  windfall from any of my family members passing, let alone my mother.  This is probably the most money she has ever had in her life and I  expect most of it to be gone fairly soon due to outstanding bills and debts that she has. Additionally, while she has occasionally mentioned  in passing how she wants her funeral to be handled (cremation) I have no  idea if she has this in writing.  Well, my mother certainly didn't seem to think so. During the conversation  she became increasingly agitated and couldn't seem to understand why I  was asking her about this. It became increasingly clear during this that she seemed to believe that my purpose was trying to ensure that I would get money out of her if/when she passed. This further progressed into her suggesting that someone was putting ideas in my head, possibly my father's side of the family who I spent the holidays with whom she doesn't like all that much (not the family of her recent ex btw; my biological father died when I was very young). All in all, the conversation didn't end particularly well, with several \"f*** you's\"  being thrown in my direction after challenging her about her low opinion of my father's family.  I understand that talking about wills and the possibility of your parent passing away can be really morbid and awkward. But was I the asshole here? Am I just a weirdo for bringing this up?\n",
      "(Sorry for shitty formatting and writing, I’m on mobile)  So for context my grandmother is 82F and I’m 17F. Her health has been declining for the past few years and now she’s been getting blood transfusions about every 2 months and she’s been slowly but steadily getting worse. She’s also in what my brother (doctor) thinks is beginning stage dementia. I have anorexia and endometriosis, which sounds irrelevant but it’ll make sense later.   Anyways, on with the post. I love my grandmother, I really do. We had an almost perfect relationship for 13 years and ultimately she’s family and I love her. However, lately she’s been really getting under my skin.   It all started about four years ago when I first met my lesbian cousin. She began making comments about how she’s “Nice for a lesbian” “kinda fruity” “better than most of her people” and it really disturbed me. I’m gay, I’ve always been gay but always been terrified of telling her. This seemed to open the floodgates, because she began making more and more comments about gay people and becoming intensely homophobic. If I try and redirect the conversation she just brings it back or begins accusing me of ignoring her, so I’ve just begun retracting in conversation and don’t really initiate anymore.   Additionally, she makes a lot of comments about my body. She knows I struggle with anorexia and body image issues, but I can’t seem to win with her. When I lose weight she says I’m too skinny, and when do I gain she calls me fat and says I need to watch my figure. I’ve told her multiple times that it makes me uncomfortable, but she just brushes me off or accuses me of being too sensitive. She calls my anorexia “fake” and says I’m “looking for attention” and says that mental illness doesn’t exist,  which sets off a whole new argument.   As she’s become more sick, she has been trying to encourage me to stop taking my endometriosis medication because it “works for me” (it doesn’t) and starts accusing me of not listening to her when I try to redirect the conversation or refuse. At this point, almost every visit I’ve had with her in the past year has ended in tears.   She’s become more critically ill in the past six months, and only become nastier as time progresses. I’ve started refusing to visit her in the hospital because I can’t take being around her anymore. I don’t want to have to deal with coming away from every encounter crying and the awful feeling that comes with it. My mother has begun calling me selfish and a bad granddaughter and my aunt will barely speak to me. I’ve been getting texts and calls from my family telling me to see her and calling me selfish and cold hearted and I’m not sure what to do anymore.   Am I the asshole for not wanting to see her? Should I suck it up and see her? Is my family right? Should I stand my ground? Am I just a bad person?\n",
      "Seems like I’m here to use this sub again in the last 24 hours-  Me: 16 Mom: 46   Last night we were using our gas fire pit in our small backyard, when the landlord came into our backyard out of no where telling us it was illegal and we had to get rid of it. Mind you, he has a wood burning firepit in his backyard. But he raised all of his fences above everyone else’s so no one could prove it.   Now, I have severe anxiety, and hes threatened to evict us for less (Mom swore at him because she nearly broke her toe on something he was supposed to fix months back). So I’m really afraid, especially since he came and took photos of it, that hes going to try and evict us if we turn it back on. Mom won’t listen to me however. She won’t communicate with him, but instead reached out to our fire department and asked them on the laws. Legally we’re in the clear, but I just don’t want any more issues to arise. It’s embarrassing being the kid of the Karen in the neighbourhood. I know she spent money on it, but she was warned ahead of time this could happen.   I just want her to at least wait a week before she turns it back on, not literally the night after. Or at least read the contract to see if it against our contract. She keeps insisting that it’s her home and she can do what she wants and he can’t evict us, however I don’t want to take those risks. I just want us to lay low, and not try to aggravate the landlord anymore.   AITA for telling her she should maybe stop using it for a bit or all together?\n",
      "I own a medical office. For the sake of this post let’s say it’s a veterinary clinic. About six months ago I started renting space to a young doc who has been out of school 2-3 years. This person had recently left another office in town on bad terms. Before they joined this clinic they had signed a non -compete clause saying that they couldn’t practice within x amount of miles for x amount of time. I guess when they left a few (not many) clients liked this doc and decided to follow him wherever he landed.   When I first spoke to him he said he had a lawyer taking care of things and that this state doesn’t give much credence to these types of contracts, and his attorney said he could probably start practicing while they duke it out in court.   I should also say here that while I don’t know the clinic owner, I know of him and I’m not a fan of the way they run their business. Also, it’s common for them to hire young docs then treat them like slave labor.   So, he’s young, with two young kids, struggling to get started. After meeting him I decided to rent him some space and it’s been going smoothly till now.   This week the former doc called me mad saying the young doc stole patients and did I know there was this prior contract. I should also say here that I don’t necessarily subscribe to the idea that they stole patients. To me patients aren’t property and you earn them through good service.   I spoke with an attorney and I have nothing to worry about personally getting dragged into this. But even though I’m not a fan of either that type of contract or the former clinic practices I pride myself on looking at all sides and being accountable to the truth. So I’ve been trying to clearly see it from the former doc’s perspective and realizing I didn’t initially consider all sides mainly because squeezing young docs and then locking them out of the market is their reputation.  And while I’m not crazy about sending this young doc packing I live in this town and want to be above board and do what is right.  So...AITA?\n",
      "This happened about 2 years ago but I feel guilty about it and would like to know if I'm TA.  I have a group of friends and we’ve known each other since high school (12 years since then)  Larry, one of the guys and is known to be a horrible boyfriend (Lies, manipulation, cheating, etc) A couple of years ago, Larry started dating Peter's sister (Sarah).  Peter found out Larry was dating Sarah. He was livid because he didn't want Sarah to have her heart broken. Larry claimed he changed and really liked Sarah.  Eventually, Larry did cheat on Sarah on multiple occasions.  This made things weird and Peter often excused himself from meeting us. It also made us realise that Larry has been really self-centred. He exaggerates facts to sound superior and he lies frequently. Some of the guys said that Larry often twists their arm to ask for unreasonable favours.  We started distancing ourselves from Larry until it reached a point where we stopped inviting him.   Awhile later, we received a text from Larry saying that he was sorry and hope that we could forgive him and accept him back.  My friends felt bad for excluding him. Peter said he didnt mind having Larry back but he wouldn’t consider Larry a friend. The rest had mixed feelings and some felt we should see if he has changed.  I was opposed to this idea as I felt our group became closer after Larry left. I didn’t want him to come back and make things awkward especially if it meant Peter would stop meeting us.  I met up with Larry a few days later. I explained how I felt and told him off. I told him how he had been a really bad friend which is why so many of us weren’t happy. He got extremely mad and started shouting saying \"He had better things to do in life and Peter and Sarah can go fuck themselves\" I got pretty agitated too at that point and let's just say the meeting did not end well.  I told my friends about the incident and they weren’t happy that I went to speak with Larry directly. I told them I was done with beating around the bush and wanted to present my thoughts directly to him.  They said I was an asshole for confronting him. They felt the apology was an olive branch which I threw in his face and I should've spoken to them. They believe that I knew the outcome would not be good and was looking for a fight.   I honestly wanted to clear the air with him but things got out of hand. I didn't want to include him if it was going to make things awkward for everyone and I wanted to find out if he knew why we were so upset with him. Upon reflecting, both of us have pretty bad tempers so perhaps unloading everything onto him wasn’t the best idea  I do feel a slight tinge of guilt for confronting him but I also feel like I did the right thing.  So do you guys think I'm TA here for not giving Larry a chance.\n",
      "I have a friend, let’s call him Brandon (not his real name btw). Brandon and I (OP) have been friends for three years, our friendship is really strong and we are open to each other about anything. He is a really nice guy, he’s kind of shy at first but when you get close to him he will tell you his entire life with all little details. I like him I really do, but just like in all friendships, our friends can be a little annoying; When Brandon gets really close to you, he starts to make “little pranks” like:  -He’ll fart in his hand and throw it on your face -He sneezes on people and don’t even apologise  -He throws up on people on purpose  -He will fart on your face anywhere  All of this thing pisses me of every time he does it, I already told him to stop, but he never does he says it’s just a joke. One day when we were in my house, the conversation went like this:  OP: Brandon, can I be real with you?  BR: yea why  OP: But I mean like really real, I don’t want to offend you but I know I will, are you sure?  BR: Sure man you can tell me anything  OP: okay...u know, I’m really grateful for our friendship, but sometimes you disgust me man, you make me wanna throw up sometimes. Bruh like literally, there are somethings you do or say that just makes me want to take a 8 hour bath on holy water while drinking two gallons of hand sanitizer. You fart on people’s faces literally anytime, and people around look at me waiting for me to beat you but I don’t because I’m your friend, so I just sit there humiliated. I have told you many times for you to stop this because I don’t feel comfortable so please stop.  Brandon stayed quiet and left my house.  Idk what to do now, this happened right now.\n",
      "Basically me and two other friends always hang out at this trampoline that was built in front of a church since our neighborhood is boring, and we have nowhere else to go. A lot of teenagers hang out at this place, and the trampoline is not “inside” the church, but it is kind of a public place. The church itself says that people are welcomed in there.  This lady lives next to a church and never told us anything when we hung out on that trampoline, which is almost every day, she actually always told us hello and made some small talk.  We never are loud or disturbing, we are actually really quiet and mostly go there on evenings when there are no reunions and stuff. Today wasn’t much of a different day, we just had a wine bottle with us and some juice to relax a bit after a stressful week of school. We didn’t get drunk. The legal age of drinking alcohol is 16 here. We are all legally drinking alcohol. A man who was sort of a priest also said Hi to us and asked us if we had any wine left for him, which was pretty funny.  Because of him we thought it was pretty much okay to be there, especially since he knew the situation wouldn’t escalate. We had already drunk the alcohol, and the empty bottle was just sitting next to me. After a few minutes the lady comes to us and tells us that she doesn’t have anything against us hanging out here, but she doesn’t want us to see there again.  I’m pretty sure she is not a priest nor anyone that is responsible for any church stuff, she is just a neighbor. We sat there because we knew nobody would be at the church, and I don’t honestly get why the lady was mad. Was ist because of the alcohol ? Or because we always hung out there ? Anyways, my question is, am I the asshole for drinking in front of a church even tho nobody was around ?  edit: the trampoline is not INSIDE the church, and no, not even the priest has anything against teenagers hanging out there.  edit 2: the neighbour is a few houses away, so the trampoline is no on her property.  edit 3: public intoxication means that you get DRUNK und PUBLIC places. We were NOT DRUNK.\n",
      "One weekend I was sick with the flu and was in bed all day. Both my roommates were out all day and night, and unbeknownst to me, neither of them brought their house keys with them.  &#x200B;  For context, over previous months these roommates would consistently forget to bring their keys with them and make me meet them across town to take my keys if they needed to get home.   &#x200B;  This evening, I was feverish and almost fast asleep when I got a text message from my roommate asking where I was and if they could meet me to pick up my keys. I was super annoyed and deliriously tired so I just went to sleep and ignored the text. I figured that my roommates would just sleep elsewhere if they couldn't get in, plus we had many friends that lived within a 10 minute walk of our flat at that time, who all said they would have let my roommates crash there.  &#x200B;  The next morning I got up early and on my way out for a coffee I saw that my roommates weren’t home, and discovered both of their keys hanging by the front door. I left a key under the doormat and went out. It turns out my roommates slept in the stairway inside our building overnight and cussed me out, blaming me for them having to sleep rough.  &#x200B;  Am I the asshole for trying to teach them a lesson by not letting them in?\n",
      "It’s my (31F) mother’s 58th birthday tomorrow. A few months ago, I was telling her how I tried floatation therapy after being constantly stressed out and sad and how it helped me actually just relax for a bit without distractions. Mom seemed really interested and kept asking questions about what it was like and I asked if she’d try it sometime. She said she was interested and would like to give it a go.  I brought it up to my brother (27M) and he agreed to go splits on a float session as well as a massage as a birthday gift - my mother works a stressful job and could use a professional massage.  We were planning on taking my Mom out for dinner today as a pre-birthday celebration, but my father (58M) and sister (17F) got sick and we ended up cancelling just to be safe. While we were on the phone, I brought up my gift idea for Mom and suggested to Dad that if he didn’t have anything for her, he could go splits with my brother and I, since it would make it cheaper for all of us and we could really get her something nice.  Before I could even fully explain it, Dad said that it “didn’t appeal to him at all”. I told him it was a good thing it wasn’t for him, then; that it was for his wife who had been interested in it. He responded by saying it sounded like “bullshit” and he got her something else anyway that he thinks would be better for her. Apparently it’s a massaging neck pillow (which in my opinion does nothing) and he’ll probably end up using it more anyway. I said fine, told him I hoped he and my sister felt better and hung up, but was pissed.  I was still angry hours later and sent him a text telling him how disappointed and upset I was from his attitude about my gift idea. I told him his response was uncalled for and that deciding that what he thinks Mom should have over what she actually wanted was selfish. He read the message, but never responded.  Dad and I butt heads a lot and usually end up in arguments at any family gatherings and I’m often told I didn’t have to drill into him that hard, or that I’m being unreasonable with how upset I am or not being respectful to him. I don’t think I was wrong for calling him out, but now I’m worried I’m being petty and coming across as spoiled because he wouldn’t help with Mom’s gift.  AITA for getting mad?  EDIT: After sleeping on it, I figured out some stuff and I decided to add more context - it was late when I wrote this, I was still kind of upset and tired.  I’m not angry at him for deciding he didn’t want to help; that’s fine. As people have mentioned (and I decided before reading any of these replies), he’s within his right to say no.  I’m angry about how he belittled it.  My Dad often shits on things that I like; be it music, art, tattoos, TV shows, movies, make-up, he always finds something to comment on when it comes to my interests that belittle them and make them (and my proxy, me) seem stupid.  I’m sure he does the same to my mother. I don’t know if he does it with everything, but one of her favourite things is Hallmark Christmas movies. She knows they aren’t good but they fill her with a lot of joy. I’ve heard him ask her “are you really watching that shit again?”  I’m tired of him dunking on stuff we like and deciding for us that it’s not valuable because he thinks it’s bullshit. I realized that’s what I was so upset about.  For reference, here is the message I sent him last night that he didn’t reply to:  “I have to be honest, I’m deeply upset and disappointed about your response to the gift idea that I had for Mom, especially since it was something she asked for directly.  Calling it bullshit and saying it “didn’t appeal to you” was uncalled for. I understand that you don’t believe it has value, but she clearly does if she asked for it. With respect, taking into consideration what she wants versus what you think she should have should take president when it comes to gifts for her. Something to think about, perhaps.”  Anyway, thanks for all the responses. They gave me a lot to think about.\n",
      "First of all I love my mother. She's great. But she has a hard time understanding that I need time to myself.  Only way I can be alone, is to schedule myself around her schedule.  She's a teacher so I see a lot more of her over the summer and is therefore much less predictable.  WIBTA if I placed a tracker on her phone so I know when she is and isn't home?    I am an adult with a fulltime job. I contribute 50% to the bills.    I could move out but that would make both of us a lot less comfortable. My privacy isn't worth the financial hardship.    Last time I talked to her about it, she made an honest effort to give me space but it obviously still hurt her feelings. I'd like to get my alone time in a way where it's not as obvious.    **Edit: Three minutes in and it's already pretty clear.  I won't do the tracker. I figured it was a dumb idea but wanted to make sure.**\n",
      "(Throwaway account)  My father-in-law is pretty overweight, probably 250+ pounds. I have heard him on multiple occasions saying he is trying to lose weight. However, it's been a few years and I can say that he hasn't made much progress. I know it must be hard. And I'm not trying to fat-shame or anything like that, I just know that he does WANT to lose the weight, but can't. From what I know, he doesn't have a medical issue preventing him from losing weight, it's mostly a matter of fast food, takeout and sweets.  My own father was severely overweight (330+ pounds). Just a few years ago, he had a sudden heart attack and died around the age of 64. It was basically caused by his obesity. My ENTIRE life I heard him say he's \"going to lose weight.\" But every night he would have a bowl of ice cream and say, I'll start tomorrow. And then one day he just lost the chance to.  I can see my FIL going down the exact same path and I've debated speaking to him about it as sort of a \"wake up call\" but I don't want to cause any hard feelings. I hate to think that he probably only has 10 years left or so if nothing changes. I'm not sure what I would even say honestly. But I've seen with my own eyes the constant cycle of \"I need to lose this weight to be healthy\" and \"well, just one more donut won't hurt today.\"  So do I say nothing to avoid hurt feelings, or worse, damaging the family relationship entirely? Or WIBTA if I step in and try to make him understand how important it is to take healthy eating seriously, considering my father died because he didn't?\n",
      "i was recently kicked out of the house when i got caught with a roach (the end) of a blunt. i was told come back when you aren’t high. i hadn’t even smoked yet i was just mad and needed to clear my mind so i went on a walk. it was like 12:00 and at like 1am i came back and the garage door code was changed. i proceeded to knock on the door for and ring the doorbell until they let me in because i didn’t wanna sleep outside.   (side note: this all stems from them catching me smoking in the house [which i didn’t know i wasn’t allowed to do, since my mom has smelled it before and not said anything] and taking my door/all my belongings.)   anyways, my dad answers and my moms also there and they get mad at me and say they are gonna “check my eyes” which is dumb because eyedrops exist and they know i own them lol. but they proceed to come to my room (i can’t close the door because there isn’t one) and then they look at my eyes and my mom goes “your pupils are dilated” to which i responded are you dumb that doesn’t happen when you smoke.   i feel bad because i’ve been in and out of the house and causing my parents probably a very hard time. but at the same time it feels they have no respect for me after they took my things/door. i have no belongings other than clothes and my old xbox 360 basically. my camera lenses, expensive sports cards, and other stuff were just thrown into trashbags and never seen again.   AITA for leaving the house and being mad at my parents?\n",
      "Okay, so I live with my mum and two younger sisters and this weekend, Mum took a girly weekend holiday to Dublin. The house was kind of a mess when she left, so she told us to split to chores between us.  My middle sister was working both afternoons and evenings, leaving my youngest sister and I to pull part of her weight, so we decided to split it half way between us.   She did her half first and then cane to tell me what was left to do. I got around to it and completed it in my own time Friday evening and then I went back to my room to chill.  On Saturday, I began work at 7pm and I came home at 4am this morning. (I’m a bar tender, nights like that are normal)  She leaves it to 6pm Saturday evening to tell me I did a shit job and that I should start over. I told her that even if I wanted to do that, I have no time as I had to get ready and leave for work in the space if 40 min and she was PISSED. She was swearing, slamming doors, just throwing a huge childish tantrum (she’s 14).  So I go to work, I come home exhausted and she wakes me up 6 hours later to tell me that Grandad has come to visit. I look like I just been stood behind a plane taking off, I can barely understand what he was saying because I was just that tired.  After he leaves, my sister is like “So are you going to help me now?” I told her not right now, I’m exhausted, I got home at 4am this morning, I’ve slept 6 hours after a painfully long and exhausting bar shift, the last thing I want to do is pack the dishwasher. So she throws another tantrum, complaining about how lazy I was yesterday, that she has to do everything in the house and just all round that life is unfair.  AITA and how can I convince her otherwise if I’m not.\n",
      "This happened last year but got brought up again recently.   I (26F) work for the retail side of a tech company, and I've worked here for three years. There are about 25 employees in my department, and they range from ages 20-40. The working environment is pretty casual.  I always go really full out for Halloween, and my coworkers know this. Last year, because I was only having a micro-party because of Covid, I decided to dress a little sexier than I normally would. I went as Emma Frost from the X-Men comics, and I wore basically just a bra, pants, and a cape.   The day after Halloween, my coworkers started sharing their costumes in our group chat. My coworkers were bugging me to send mine, but I told them it was \"a little risque\", so I didn't think I should. Honestly I wasn't even embarrassed, I just didn't want to get in trouble. Well, during our Zoom calls they kept bugging me, so I ended up sending a photo of my costume. Because of the sexy costume, my pose was also kind of sexy.  Well, the next day I got reprimanded by my boss, and a couple days later I got reprimanded by my  boss'  boss, because apparently the photo was inappropriate. For the first time  ever  we recently got an email saying that \"all personal photos shared through company communications must comply with company dress code\", which feels directed at me.   AITA? Multiple coworkers asked to see my costume (not in a creepy way, I'm just known for going all out), and the photo was suggestive, but absolutely not dirty by any means.\n",

Again, This friend is not a close friend and I feel like recently she only calls me when she needs something. I’ve let her crash at my place before because she was in an uncomfortable situation. She lives in our hometown still, but comes to our school to see people.   One day, she texted me asking if she could come over if her date with a guy got too uncomfortable for her. I told her to text me if she needed me. I honestly wanted to say No because she texted me the day of and I wasn’t in the mood to have someone over.  And I’ve noticed she only asks to come over if it is a benefit to her. She doesn’t text me when she’s just in the area to invite me to do something. However, I told her to text me just in case because I understand how things can get weird.   She ended up texting me around 11 pm. I was already in bed and did not want to be around anyone. I was exhausted and didn’t have a social battery. And I didn’t feel as inclined to help her since she only hits me when she needs something. I didn’t respond until the morning when I told her I was sleeping.   She ended up driving home that night and wasn’t mad at me, but I don’t know if that was an asshole move.\n",
      "I have a friend who every day tells me I need to put a photo of myself on my discord profile picture. He says he wants to see me but he has multiple pictures of me so I don't know why I need to put in publicly. I've told him multiple times that I value privacy and am in multiple servers where I'd prefer random strangers not to see my photo.  Ive also explained i don't feel safe because I had my photo years ago and received explicit messages on discord from people in the servers.   He will not take no as an answer and has told me if I don't use my profile as my picture, he won't be friends with me any more. I genuinely don't understand what I'm doing wrong. Am I the asshole and if so, why?\n",
      "My friend Mike is bipolar, has a pill and drinking problem, and comes from an EXTREMELY wealthy background, which has caused issues with us in the past as I grew up lower class blue collar. He also lies. He lies often about stupid shit. I can tell when he's lying, and typically he lies to me about incidents at work, or interactions with people. It is annoying AF and the thing I like the least about him.  In the last few years, my mom and grandma have died. My dad sold his house and is moving out of state. My wedding might get canceled due to Covid, and I had a health scare earlier this year that Mike knew about.  Mike called me a couple weeks ago. He was at the airport waiting flights to help out of state hotels. A few issues: he is a revenue manager for a small chain of hotels. I don't really understand why hotels in other states would need the revenue manager of a small hotel chain to fly out to them to help at a time when hotels are regulated to have very few or no guests (I have been questioning if he didn't get furloughed seeing as his hotels have been shut down since March). Secondly it was QUIET in the background on his phone. I didn't hear a single announcement or noise in the background the entire phone call. Mike proceeds to bitch about all of the assholes he sees with masks on and saying he wants to cough in their faces. He then moves onto giving me a story about how his parents called him earlier to tell him they sold the family home and he only has 60 days to try to pick up stuff. I tried to be supportive and said that with today's technologies, maybe he could have his mom face time him and they could go through the house together. I also suggested he make a list of things he can think of right now that he wants to keep as that's what I did with my dad. He got hysterical and started screaming that I didn't understand how awful this all is and it's the end of the world and horrible blah blah blah. Queue fake crying. I was exasperated admittedly and told him I was really sorry and he seemed stressed. I said he should run himself a bath when he got to Florida and do some breathing exercises. Hysterical crying from Mike stopped immediately and he said \"I am probably going to regret saying this. But I have been there for you through all of your bullshit and you don't seem interested in my problems at all. SO FUCK YOU.\" I sat on the phone for a beat and then just said \"Fuck me, Mike? Fuck you.\" and hung up. I then texted him saying I was done with this toxic AF friendship. He has texted several times since then, but they all say \"are you done being mad at me yet?\" no apology.  So, AITA for cutting off the friendship over this? I feel like time and his text messages are breaking me down.  TLDR: pretty sure my boisterous friend made up a bullshit story for attention and got pissed when I didn't fall for it. I've ended the friendship over it.\n",
      "I'm 22f and I'll be getting married soon to my 22m fiance and he thinks I'm overreacting so I figured I'd ask here.  Background: the family in question is on my mom's side and they are very entitled to lack of a better term. But there are only a few which I still consider family.  It all starts with my grandma, I loved her more than anything and I miss her so much. She was so family-oriented, anything to do with family and she was there. But that side of the family used her love and kindness for personal gain and always felt like they were entitled to her help, money, etc..  I told her to be careful about what she says okay to when it comes to them because they like to cause drama\\trouble.  Well, her being the way she was she always got mad at me because they were her family and she loved them. They never called or came over unless they needed something and there has been a hand full of times where they would cuss us out or threaten to do something if they didn't get their way blah blah.  Now that my grandma is gone they just dropped contact, a few times they will see me or my mom in public and say hi, they missed us, and we love you but other than that nothing.   Now that I'm getting married, I'm making decisions about who to invite and I think back to my grandma and how she was and I feel this huge guilt hanging over me because I don't want some of them there because of how they act and fights that could erupt.   I want to know WIBTA if I choose not to invite the family members or suck it up because they are family and wouldn't want my grandma to be dissaponuted in me?\n",
      "I have ADHD and I like to think of myself as more than my ADHD because I don't like being defined by it. Growing up I faced bullying due to my ADHD and it was/is seriously annoying.  I have a friend that I met through my ex boyfriend. She stuck with me after finding out he cheated and stuck with me through other things, we have been friends for 6 years. She knows about my ADHD and always makes jokes about it. I let it go a few times but it really started to piss me off. She would make jokes such as \"Lets use your ADHD to get free fast passes at Canada's Wonderland\" or \"Can we get another beer for the special education girl?\" Infront of the bartender at a bar.   I get that she's just joking but it does really piss me off, one remark that she said recently really made me upset. We were hanging out at my apartment when I was bringing her a glass of water. I tripped and dropped the glass on the floor, causing it to shatter. Instead of helping me clean it up she said \"Wow, I guess your special education didn't help with your clumsiness.\" She then proceeded to laugh and thats when I snapped. I told her to stop making jokes about something I don't want to define my personality.  She was pretty shot back by this comment and went \"Wow, calm down, jeez.\" Then left my apartment about 20 minutes later. I'm not going to apologize for it because she's done this so many times. We haven't spoken since and I honestly don't feel bad. My ADHD isn't my personality and not something to joke about.   So AITA?\n",
      "(I’m on mobile sorry for any funky formatting)   my (F19) roommate (F20) has a cat, and her mom has a cat that occasionally comes and stays at the house. I’m fine with that. I don’t love it but I’m fine with it. However, they are a ruckus and  keep me awake by fighting often, have already broken multiple candles and plant holders and have ripped the lights off my bedroom wall.   Where the problem comes in is that I have a really beautiful vintage Ethan Allen couch that I fixed up myself and love a lot, the cats also happen to love my couch a lot and insist on scratching the sides of it all the time.   Ive mentioned this to to my roommate multiple times, Ive offered solutions like a scratching tower or post, asked her to keep them in her room etc for the last 3 months. She still let them scratch when I wasn’t around, and today there is one hole in each leg of my couch.   As silly as it sounds, I love my couch a lot and I want to ask her to pay for the repair which will likely cost somewhat of a pretty penny for a college student. Is that an unreasonable thing to do ??\n",
      "Throwaway account because I’m pretty sure my family uses Reddit. I’m on mobile please don’t kill me.  A little backstory, my bother is a fucking asshole, he’s inconsiderate, obnoxious, toxic, and is a pain in the ass to be around. He smells because he doesn’t shower often and he refuses to pull himself out of a dead end job.  He will play video games at 2-3am which I’m sure we have all done except he is loud, obnoxiously loud. He plays with his friends for hours screaming at his game, yelling at his friends, talking loudly and shit. Genuinely just being a piece of shit.  He tried to charge me for a Redbull I tried (and hated) that I didn’t know was his. I refused as he had drank and eaten shit I had bought before and I never tried to get him to pay me back. That is another thing, he eats other peoples food without asking. It’s a bunch of small shit that he does that pisses me off.  I have tired to get my parents involved because if I tried talking with him it would just be a screaming match between us, and to their credit they have tried but failed. He will say “okay okay” the entire time until they leave then continue to be a piece of shit.  Things only got worse when we moved to a new state where I don’t feel like I belong, I hate it here.   Many months back I started my enlistment process for the military and just a few weeks ago I finished it and I am currently waiting on ship out.  There is a problem though, my ship out date is right before thanksgiving. My family is torn. They asked me why it’s so close so I decided to tell them.  For those who don’t know the military will ask you “how soon can you go to basic” and if you put ASAP they will try to get you into basic ASAP.  So I told them I put ASAP and I guess they put me in ASAP.  My mom asked why and I told her.... I told her in the kindest way possible that I wanted to leave as soon as possible, I’m tired of constantly fighting my brother, I’m tired of waking up at 3 am to him screaming at his fucking game, I’m tired of them not enforcing rules on him. I don’t like this state, I want to leave this house as soon as possible.  My mom didn’t answer and just went to her room....I feel terrible but I frankly feel like it needed to be said. So Reddit, am I the asshole for saying why I am leaving soon  Edit: Thank you for all your very kind words. I tried to upvote and reply to most of you but there are so many! And Rslash if you are reading this, Hi!  Update: I tried talking with my mom again and...it didn’t go well. She tried to shift blame off of her and said that I was loud too at night to her credit I sometimes will cook dinner at around 10:30 to midnight if I haven’t eaten yet. I understand that however she kept bringing it up like it was a major point to be made despite all the shit my brother does.  She also got into me for not having a job despite the fact that I have enough money saved to sustain myself for well over the 3 months until I go to basic.  I used to have a job however I lost it when she made us move to a new state and due to me leaving so soon I just don’t feel the need to get a job when I’ll be fine for the next 3 months. The only person who has supported me is my father who has been helping me through out my enlistment process.  After this conversation with my mother I still feel terrible for making her upset but I know that I made the right call putting ASAP on my survey, or whatever it was.  Thanks for all of your kind comments\n",
      "My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) are trying to get back into shape. We have a treadmill and a little weight set up at our house. Everytime I tell him I'm going to go workout he insists on doing it with me. I understand he is trying to spend time with me and I love spending time with him but it has become annoying and here's why:   I love working out because I get to put headphones in and just listen to music and do my thing but I can't with him. He gets annoyed if I can't hear him and I've tried to play music off of a speaker but he talks shit on the music I play.  He changes what workout I am doing. For example I will be trying to bench presses and he tells me to get up and he'll change the seat incline and expects me to just change what I'm trying to do. Today I told him I was getting on the treadmill and he suggested we go play disc golf instead.   He is 6' 5\" and I am 5' 5\" so he can obviously lift more than me and it gets annoying constantly changing weights everytime we switch and take turns.  He is always rushing me. Asking when I'm going to be done with what I'm doing and when he tells me he is done he expects me to stop as well.  The weight set is not alot so we both can't be doing something at the same time so we take turns and it's weird just standing around waiting. So am I the asshole?\n",
      "So about 6 months ago, I lent a book to a friend (at the time at least). I'm moving away in a couple weeks, so about a month ago I asked the guy to give it back.   So this is a guy I've known since September. When I met him, I thought he seemed like a good guy. He gave me a ride once, and took me out to lunch. That being said, he's always been extremely bad at getting back to me. At least like 5 or 6 times, he's brought up doing fun things together, bike rides, gaming, he invited me to his place once, then I'll text him about doing these things, and he'll just never reply. He's also told me he has some mental health issues, and I feel like I've done my best to let express my best wishes and let him know he can chat with me if he wants. He hasn't replied to those texts either. At a certain point I gave up on trying to be friends with someone who doesn't ever text me back.   So the book, it's important to me. It shaped a lot of my worldview, and I've liked loaning it to others. I asked him about a month ago to bring the book to the next class. Since then, he's either not brought the book, or not come to class at all. At one point he told me he'd drop it off at my place tomorrow, and then failed to text me the next day. I should note that he had told me during this that he'd been dealing with some issues. I expressed my sympathy at that, but held firm on wanting him to return the book.   Today was the last day of classes, and it was online because our professor has covid. He told me he'd drop the book off at my place. He then sent me a photo of the book to show it was safe, followed by a photo of several books burning saying \"it spontaneously combusted\". I replied \"??\" and he said it was a joke. This struck me as really weird after a month of not returning the book.   He then asked for my address, which I provided. He then texted me that he hadn't the time to drop it off that day since I hadn't send him my address, but that he'd drop it off tonight. I replied telling him that I'd sent him the address.   At this point he called me. He called me names, and told me that we were in a \"non-reciprocal relationship\". He asked me if the book was  really  this important. My feeling is that it's my book and therefore not his call to make whether or not it's important. He brought up that he'd taken me out for lunch, and given me a ride, but that I hadn't done the same. This is true, but I can't do that if he doesn't text me back, which I told him. He also mentioned that his sister has provided advice on where I'm moving to, to which I mentioned that I'd offered to take her out to lunch or coffee, and that she hadn't taken me up on it. He yelled \"I wonder why!\" and then hung up.   He texted me again after saying something nasty, so I replied basically laying out events, since I didn't think he was being honest. I ended the text by telling him that I know he has mental health issues, but taking those out on me is a dick move.   AITA?\n",
      "So I [25m] have been dating my gf [26F] for 8 months now after I relocated to a new city. She has a celebrity crush on a guy about our age. I can't relate because I don't have any celebrity crushes, but it's not a big deal to me. I should add that she's very into social media (Instagram/Twitter) while I'm not at all and don't have accounts.  Recently one of my friends from back home came to visit and was interested to hear more about my new girlfriend since he was meeting her for the first time. I mentioned that he could probably find her on Instagram and confirmed for him when he was on the right account.  So he started going through her most recent posts. There was a post from one of our recent nights out at the bar with a couple's pic of her and I with another of us and some of her friends. There was a separate post of a solo pic of her from the same night where she was flaunting her stuff, but she tagged her celebrity crush in the post.  I realize I may be coming off as insecure, but it really doesn't sit well with me that she tagged her crush. While there is essentially no chance he responds and an even smaller chance that they meet up, the act of attempting and essentially begging for his attention is gross to me. Especially considering she posted it with the assumption that I would never see it. I'm surely blowing it out of proportion to a degree but it's also basically confirmation that she would leave me if given the chance.   I haven't confronted her about it and I'm just conflicted about how I should feel in general.\n",
      "I live in a converted Victorian home which is now 5 flats. I've lived here for two years, and I love it since it's always been quiet and comfortable.   About 3 weeks ago I got a new neighbour; a mid-thirties single Dad who works from home. He seemed polite, and we were initially friendly. Then he started playing music, every day at various times. I ended up knocking on his door and explaining that it was bothering me since we have absolutely no sound-proofing/insulation (its a very old house) and he agreed to keep it low. I thought that was that,  it was mostly quiet.   A week later at dinner time  I hear classical music playing really loudly - turns out this guy bought a piano. Since then, it's been hours every day listening to him practice. After listening to it Friday evening, all day Saturday and Sunday I knocked on his door to ask him to stop. I wasn't exactly polite, but not rude either I just cut to the chase and asked he please stop the piano. Before I could get much out he threw his hands up, told me to leave him alone, and slammed the door.   A minute later he started banging on his ceiling (my floor), and then started playing piano again, really aggressively hitting the keys as hard as possible.   Things have calmed down now, but I do want to know if I've been unreasonable. Who plays piano (or any instrument) regularly in a flat? And who wouldn't be annoyed listening to it for 8 hours over the weekend?  Edit: regarding my living situation - I live in London, where the vast overwhelming majority of rental properties are converted Victorians it's a very common setup. There is an expectation of hearing normal 'people' noise, I have no issue with that. My issue is specifically with the playing of music, which is frustrating since I've never had an issue with other 8 tenants in the years I've been here.\n",
      "Let me preface this by saying that I'm from India where you can get public transport like cabs and autorickshaws with Uber and other apps, but you can go to them directly and decide a rate and go with that too. So here, outside a restaurant at around 10pm, I got a cab and we bargained for the fare and I sat.   The distance was less than 8kms and we settled on INR 150 after him quoting 250 and me starting with 100. After I sat, he just started casually chatting with me. He starts off by saying -  Cab driver: I just want to say one thing.. I hope you don't mind. You youngsters go out to fancy restaurants yet fight over 50-100 rupees.   Me: Hmmm, you are right but it's not right to just quote whatever to a customer. We have our own issues and a budget to run with as well, and I don't overpay. Infact I don't even drink or anything.   Cab driver: Whatever you're saying is right and it feels extremely bad to even ask and I never do because it hurts my ego to ask and it feels like begging. But yeah, life is just like that.   Me: Hmm, yeah sure.  The conversation ends there and for 20 minutes, no one says anything until we reach the destination. Then, he looked at me with a weird expression and I gave him the original amount we decided and moved on. He felt a little bad, I could see it in his eyes, but I felt like it's not fair to just overpay because they're not financially well.   AITA?  TLDR: am I the asshole for sticking to the original price decided by a cab driver and I while mid way he asked me to give him more because cab drivers in general don't earn much in my country? and also instead of saying I'm sorry I can't pay or making an excuse, I decided to tell him how problems are relative and everyone's going through their own issues?\n",
      "my husband and I raised our family in a bungalow in the Midwest which both of us love very much .  Due to my health and my husband’s financial sense ,  we purchased a home by the Sea & with the real estate boom,  placed the bungalow on the market .  it sold right away so there it was —.  i have come back  now for medical tests (staying with the same doctor).  and i want to see our Bungalow but I feel i’m not entitled - to knock on the door or to see the gardens - tho they are dormant .  my husband says there’s no harm in trying but it feels very  improper & rather assholey  to show up like that . i think to visit would be cathartic and help me accept my current position.  I have mourned the change - because of my love for the home , the memories.    I suppose i don’t have scandal here,  just an awkward and potentially disruptive encounter\n",
      "I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting, and I know the title sounds bad, but hear me out.  So I (23F) got the message last night that my granddad passed away, my dads dad. He's been ill for a while, dementia and the like. As far I'm aware he passed peacefully. My Nan died just over 20 years ago, so he's now also an orphan. I'm a bit sad about his passing, but didn't really have that much of a connection to him.  My dad has some kind of mental illness (thought to be Borderline personality disorder), is a compulsive liar and struggles with alcohol. So growing up really fucking sucked. Standard emotional/psychological abuse. My siblings and me all struggle with mental illnesses too because of this, like anxiety, depression etc., I even struggled with anger management and also alcohol for a while. My parents split when I was 16, and for a while everything got worse, I even ended up being admitted to a clinic for a while. My dads way of treating us has had lasting effects. When my parents split my brother was back in the UK going to college, so it was me and my 2 little sisters, we moved into a smaller flat with my mum, and my dad carried on being a dick. He's refused child maintenance payments so my mum has had to support 4 kids by herself the past 8 years, insulted us all, talked behind our backs, lied to us, and just generally been nasty. Then, when I was 18, I cut off all contact because of something that for me was the last straw. Haven't spoken to him since except when needing him to sign something. I also do not plan on changing this as hes super toxic and really bad for my mental health. I've moved out, but my dad actually lives about 20 minutes away (by foot) from my mum, yet has never really attempted to contact me, no letters or emails etc.  I'm assuming my dad cant get back to the UK cos of everything going on rn, hes even been mssging my mum talking about it all, which tells me it's definitely hit him hard, I mean he's talking to my mum and not insulting or shouting at her so I know it's difficult for him, hes in Germany and has a girlfriend but like his whole family is in the UK except my mum, siblings and me.  Now, here's the arsehole question: WIBTA if I didn't mssg him about his dad and say like my condolences etc? I kind of feel like I'm obliged to (respectful thing to do I'd do it with anyone else) and also I've realised that I do actually still love him more than I thought, but I don't really want to mssg him incase it kind of turns into a normal conversation or gives him hope I wanna reconsider my stance on not talking to him and cutting him out of my life, and I feel itd be cruel to have to remind him of that if he tries to carry on talking to me and I have to cut him off, given the circumstances. If everything was normal right now like he could hop on a flight back to the UK and stuff I'd deffo not feel this bad for him, but I feel like he might have no one to really grieve with, and I'd hate to be in that position myself.  Edit: format and added a sentence\n",
      "Hello. This is the first time I write on Reddit. I am an Asian, not really skillful in English. So please bear with me if I make grammatical mistakes on my writing.  I (21F) have been in peak insecurity these days. I am worried about my future, my appearance, my weight, my school, and other issues. I am not talkative. Not that I dislike chatting. I actually enjoy it but I get tired if I talk or listen to someone talking too much. I am not good at expressing my words and emotions. I only have a few friends but I am pretty close with them.   Back then when I was not in a good term with Mom (When we have a fight, I am usually just silent), she went out with Dad until quite late. House was empty, I was alone and when I asked them where have they been, Mom said something like: \"Why would I be home with someone who doesn't talk at all.\"  I found that very hurtful for me. I didnt say anything but until now I sometimes still think about it.  Few days ago Dad said that I should take care of my appearance more cause currently I have acnes on my face. He told me I should have a glowing face like my cousin.  I know that my face is in a bad condition and probably it is because I stopped doing my skincare routine months ago but I feel disheartened at the mention of my cousin. Nevertheless I didnt say anything and I bought some skincares again today and determined to take care of my skin again.  This afternoon was okay and I spent it with my parents in the living room. I was busy with assignment and they were chatting about a celebrity who refuses to have children and prefer to adopt kid instead. And then Dad said something like, \"well why don't we give her (me) to that celebrity instead?\"  I knew he was joking and honestly I didnt feel that angry, but I just instantly teared up and hit him with my pillow. I ran to my bedroom and slammed the door in front of them. They were confused that I was angry. They said they were joking, and I have to socialize more since I get angry so easily and cant joke with them.  I dont know what to do or what to say but I really just feel sad. Am I overreacting? Am I the AH for getting angry at their joke?\n",
      "I (23F) am the youngest of 4, The oldest being Aaron (31M) followed by Serena (28F) and Sean (26M). I have been with my Fiancé since 2012 and only came about telling my family a couple years ago (wasn't supposed to be dating that young).  Background - When I first met my Fiancé he had a really bad stutter and through getting to know each better I recommended seeing someone who could help. That's when I came to know about his family's financial situation an how it wasn't the best, so I started to put away small portion’s of my allowance I got from my parents so I could be able to help him. So with my allowance and the money he made through his part time job he was able to go to speech therapy. Him talking to me about it always made me excited since it was something that made him super insecure. He still Stutters but it's usually only when he's excited or uncomfortable in situations.  3 Weeks ago my siblings went out and I wasn't able to make it due to being busy with school/work. The next day both Serena an Sean sat me down and told me that the whole night consisted of Aaron making fun of the way my fiancé speaks and how his random stutters are annoying. They did tell me he was drunk and how they both left him there since it was unacceptable to be speaking about anybody like that. I wasn't okay with not letting my fiancé know so I told him what was said. I seen how upset he got but he told me to let it slide this one time since he's my brother and he probably won't say it again.  Yesterday all of us were having dinner at my parents house when Aaron Struck up a conversation with My fiancé and asked him how he was able to pay for speech therapy. My fiancé did mention how I helped him pay for it and how me talking him into going was the best decision. My sister tried to change the conversation as she noticed my boyfriend getting a little uncomfortable but Aaron said 'well that was a waste of your time and my sisters money'. I decided to tell him how done I was with his shït and that I want nothing to do with him.   When I got home my parents sent messages saying that they understand my decision yet They feel as though I went over board.  Edit - Grammer\n",
      "Both my mom and I work remote at two different big name companies. We are leaving for a road trip on Saturday and we scheduled the dog grooming 3 weeks in advance.  My mom originally asked if I could take our dog to get groomed at 1pm because she had an important meeting at that time and she couldn't miss it. I told her okay and I blocked off my work calendar for 12:30 - 1:30 because at 1:35pm I also had a meeting and needed to be back on time.  12:30 rolls around and I get our dog ready and I drive to the pet grooming place [12-14 minute drive] just to be told our dog's appointment isn't until 1:30pm and they didn't have any space for her and I would have to come back.  I called my mom and told her, and she asked if I could just stay there until 1:30.  I reminded her that I still had a 1:35pm meeting and I needed to come back on time for it because I was leading it.  My mom then asked if I wanted her to lose her job , I told her no but I would lose mine if I wasn't back on time. She was angry and took our dog back to the grooming place.  &#x200B;  Edit 1: Thank you all, I talked to my mom and she admit she was in the wrong and she said sorry!

      "My husband & I have been together for 2 an a half years. I have a daughter \"Callie\", she's 13, she loves instrumental music and piano has been her #1 interest. I'm not saying this because she's my daughter but really, I see her talent as special and more importantly...she uses it to express her feelings especially for her deceased father who passed away when she was 7. She always says that she, in a way connects to him through playing piano. So I encouraged her to do more and her grandparents bought her a 6000 thousand piano that she was so thrilled with.  The whole family encourages her but my husband thinks she's being distracted from school, real future etc. He doesn't attend her plays, doesn't help with the academy, doesn't even take the time to listen to her playing and everytime he comes home and hears her playing upstairs, he'd lecture us about how this activity is just a waste of time. I sat him down and told him about Callie picking up on that bad vibe, he got mad and said that he was doing my job for me and ensuring she doesn't get distracted from school although her grades are good.  We went back an forth on this and I made it clear that this should stop. He said okay and that was the end of it.  On Sunday a huge argument ensued in the house because my husband claimed Callie woke him up on his day off with her loud playing. He issued an ultimatuim, either the piano goes or he gets rid of it himself. I asked where should I take it? He said Callie's grandparents house but Callie didn't want to. After we left I found out that my husband took it to the junk yard his dad works at and cut it into pieces. A big argument ensued and we literally had a screaming match infront of his family over this. I gave him 2 days to pay for a new one despite him apologizing and saying he acted in a moment of desperation and frustration. He said the only way he could pay for it is using his savings that was supposed to go towards his new Garage as a side business. He complained about me forcing him to pay and ruining his business before it even starts.   He kept sending his family as middle-men to get me to give him at least 4 months but I refused and stood my ground despite being called unreasonable since it's a piano vs new business.   AITA for forcing him to pay and not giving him time?  EDIT ~~ No, he didn't have an issue with whatever Callie was doing at first til we started living together. At first I thought that as a family we tend to get annoyed by stuff other family members do but apparently...this is not the case. By the way tonight or tomorrow morning is the timeline I've given him and so far I haven't heard from him or his dad.\n",
      "A couple months ago, we got a dog. My mom loves him to death and I do too, he’s a sweetheart. The issue is he has a biting problem. He was taken away from his mom too early and has pretty bad behavioral issues. My mom thinks this is just because he’s a puppy, but I think he’s just going to grow up to be an even worse behaved dog. Anyways, that’s besides the point. Very recently I got a kitten, he’s very well behaved but he’s still being bottle fed. While I’m at school he chills in my room and really doesn’t do much. (We have two other cats and they’re pretty upset about the kitten, but we got him for our youngest cat so she could leave our older cat alone since she’s been having breathing issues.) Anyways, my Mom feeds him while I’m at school since he gets fed every 3/4 hours. Recently, my Mom has been bringing him where the dog is (he had his own area to separate from cats) and letting them see eachother. She did not tell me about this until today where I freaked out and told her she should not be doing that knowing the dogs history of being very nippy. She said I was overreacting and that the kitten will be fine, so I got over it. Just an hour ago I was feeding him out where the dog is (since my mom doesn’t let me feed him anywhere else) and the dog went to bite him. I freaked out and told her to stop feeding the kitten out there. She said she would not and she’s going to feed the kitten wherever she likes. I’m very upset about this and I do not want her to do this anymore while the kitten is still tiny. (For context the dog is medium sized and could do some real damage.) so, AITA?\n",
      "So, my BFF (F29) and her BF (M28) have been dating for about 5 years now. Recently, they've both gotten big promotions and purchased their house, and so my BFF has started to put the pressure on her BF about buying her a ring, even getting one of her other friends to talk to him about it.  A couple days ago, my husband and I were playing games online with another of our mutual friends (M28, let's call him G.) who works with my BFF's boyfriend. G. and the boyfriend have been best friends since the 7th grade. G. told us that at work, BFF's boyfriend is very vocal about how he doesn't want to get married and has no plans to propose because \"he can't afford it\" and that \"she expects him to pay for everything.\" During this conversation, I clarified that I was 100% sure BFF only expected her boyfriend to pay for the ring and not the entire wedding. Still, I was surprised by his reasoning because I know from my BFF that the boyfriend's mom offered to pay for BFF's ring and their wedding from the inheritance left from his father, who passed away last year.   I wanted to do the right thing by my BFF, so I messaged her letting her know about my conversation with G. Of course, she was upset by what her boyfriend was saying and talked with him about it that night. Apparently, they worked it out and all is well between them, but her boyfriend went to work the next day and talked to G., expressing his annoyance that G. told me what the boyfriend was saying at work. Now, G. is mad at me for telling my BFF. However, at no point was I told not to say anything, and she's my best friend and also the person I've been friends with the longest, so my loyalties lie with her. Still, I feel really bad, since G. is also one of my best friends, and even worse, is best friends with my husband. So, AITA?\n",
      "Hello, this is my first post here and I am having trouble figuring out what I should do.  I (19F) am a college student and I live on Campus. About a year ago my family bought a house. To afford the house they had to get a lot of loans and borrow a lot of money. They are still in debt, and are still paying off the mortgage for the house.  Last week my mom called me and told me that she and her sister want to buy another house to rent out to get some passive income. She then asked me how much money I have, I told her that I have around 25k. She asked me to borrow 20k. I explained to her that since she is family I would not ask her for the money back, so maybe she can rethink how much she wanted to ask for. She then asked me for 10k to buy this new house. All the money that she is getting for this new house is coming from loans and asking other people to borrow money.  I am a college student and I don't know what I want to do in the future and a lot of people are telling me not to give her the money.  WIBTA if I don't give her the 10k?  &#x200B;  Edit: People are asking how I got this money. Due to covid my scholarship money, and financial aid all went to me since I was at home.\n",
      "Hi, all! So my new friend who’s also my suite mate lives with me in a shared apartment with two other guys (at a college). He brought a speaker boom box to use during parties and such but he’s been playing it extremely late some nights, up until 4 in the morning. We are in separate bedrooms but we are 2 feet apart from each other and share opposite walls, so I can pretty much hear everything. I have actually been trying to get on a better sleep schedule this school year so I’ve been in bed by midnight and last week I asked him nicely if he could turn it down his music at 1am, which he did, and while it was still loud and I could hear it, I didn’t want to say anything wrong and step on any toes the first week of school. I had brought it up nonchalantly to him the other day saying maybe we can work out an agreement about the music and suggested I could look into a door sound blocker (even though I already have a fan and a noise machine I can still hear XO Tour Life by Lil Uzi Vert clear as day) from his bedroom. He kind of dismissed the conversation and being new friends, I didn’t want to be pushy. Now flash forward to tonight, I’m in bed at midnight as I have to be up early tomorrow morning and he comes back from a party or whatever at 2am and I wake up, as he immediately goes to his room and starts blasting music. I text him 5 minutes later if he could please use headphones as I have to be up early tomorrow, stated I didn’t want to be rude about it, but I need to sleep, and he says he “turned it down”, even though I can still hear it 10 minutes later. He then proceeds to play some dubstep rap remix of a song where I can hear every beat muffled from the opposite side of the partition and I tell him to please lower it and he says he just turned it off. I sit up in bed, walk to my door and open it, and sure enough the fucking audacity to hear the music still playing , to which I finally text him again to use headphones and as of right now, it being 3:30am, I finally don’t hear anything.  I’ve tried being as nice as I can and while I don’t have a problem with direct confrontation, we’re new friends in college living together (both sophomores) so i’m not trying to start shit, however I literally don’t know what else to do. I don’t really have a problem if he wants to play his music during the day if he’s doing work. but it's also the fact that he lied to me saying he turned it off and thought I was an idiot and wouldn’t hear it....like what? I feel like i’m being as respectful as I can, trying to ask him to not play Skrillex that late, but I feel as though he’s not showing mutual respect for me. AITA for wanting my roommate to lower his music in the middle of the night?\n",
      "I am an assistant teacher in dance class. There are a mix of ages (14-23 ish) but I am older then all but one person by at least 10 years. My teacher is disabled and needs help to maintain the class. She is very hard to communicate with.  I have recently felt at my wits end with the class. I don't see people making an effort to apply corrections, talking when directions are being given and just general apathy so I stopped saying things in a \"hey guys don't forget to make your circle a circle, if you aim to the outside of the person in front of you it will get bigger but if you aim in it will shrink and you have no place to go\" and started saying \"This is an advance class, you should be able to make a circle\".   I got confronted by a girl saying I needed to watch my tone and it wasn't very nice. I agreed but told I was responding to the complete lack of respect I received from the class after bending over backwards to try to find a positive way to change things. So am I the asshole for not sugar coating the same correction I have made 20 times already?\n",
      "So my bday is in a week (19/3), and my parents allowed me to do a little gathering at my house. I've been talking about this for some time now, but a week ago some girls of my old friend group (i will give context later) that have their birthdays on the same day, 2 days before mine, decided to do a party the day before mine (18/3). This old friend group call themselves the alternative kids in our school and i used to hang out w them, until last year, when one of my close friends, that was also part of that group, told everyone i was toxic bc i stood up to her after 2 years of constant body shaming (calling me prepubescent 12yo, door, wood plank, yk the drill) telling them i bullied her and made her have self-esteem issues. These other girls and the rest of the group believed her and have been making my life miserable ever since, including making a huge picnic last year on my birthday, in the middle of a pandemic, at the park in front of my house.  So, as i said, these girls are making a party on the day before my bday, and invited a lot of ppl from my current friend group, including my best friend. Since we r 16/17, and we don't live alone, we have to ask our parents permission, and the majority of ppl can't go out twice on the same weekend, meaning they will have to choose. My best friend told me today that she is going to the other party, bc she thinks it will be more fun, as there r more ppl invited, and that she's rly sry. I was not expecting it, and my first thought was \"wow, she's rly leaving me alone on my birthday\" and i got rly mad. I told her how i felt, that i was not expecting it, and that i would never leave her like this on her birthday. I told her it was a low blow, especially knowing my past w those girls and the friend group. After thinking about it, i feel bad about being mad at her, bc she's allowed to make her own choice and i can't interfere w that or make her feel bad about it. So, AITA?\n",
      "This a Throw away because my wife uses Reddit   I 30(M) quit my job six months ago because my boss through the could take avenge me. It a pretty niche field and it’s been hard finding a new one that pays the same. Four months ago me my wife and our three kids wouldn’t be able to stay in the place we were living with what we had saved. So we were looking for a cheaper place to go or someone we could live with in tell I found a new job. Neither my parents or hers would take us in; Nor would any of our friends. So my wife asked her brother if we could move in with him.   Now I cannot stand her brother at all 40(M). He the typical man’s man. You know it’s okey for boy to wrestle and girls to cook type of shit. One time his son was picking on mine. I asked his sone to stop but it landed on death ears so I said something to my BIL. He rolled his eye got up and said something to my son not his. My son Shook his head ran off and jumped on his cousins back made him fall. My BIL then laughed and told his son to stop picking on his little cousin. For the rest of the day when ever his son picked on my mine. My son would come in the house then sneak back out and jump on his cousins back and make him fall. The kids all get along great now but still I don’t approval of him.  So my SIL and BIL have a big house he works long day and she does all the household stuff in child rearing likes it the 50’s. He come home needs to unwind by having a couple beer while sitting in his man cave. When he off he doesn’t give his wife any her time unless it’s to get her hair done or something about her appearance. Otherwise it’s a group activity.   So me and my wife decided to start offering to babysit so the two of them can go out more often. He started picking up even more work out of the blue on the top of a hat. And would cancel on his wife. After a month of this I had enough and went out to the garage to talk to him. He offered me a drink and I let him have it. I told he need to to stop with all his toxic masculinity bs and treat his wife like a person instead of slave. He looked at me modeling his head up and down so I thought I got through to him.   He asked if I was done I said yes he okey them proceeded to yell at me at the top of his lungs. Of how I’m A failure as a father and a man. Of how I had the balls to talk shit to him while staying in his house rent free because I can put up with my boss and keep a roof over my family’s head. He then told me the reason he’s working so hard and so much overtime so he can buy his sister my wife a house because I’m such a fuck up and that this is the reason nobody else wanted us to move in with them and then my wife his sister had to beg him. By this time my with and his came into the garage to see him tearing into me. After about 10 minutes he walked off and said he need some air. After he walked off my wife and his tore into  me asking what the hell is wrong with me. This happen two hours ago he has not come back yet and neither my wife or his is talking to me. So aita?\n",
      "I have a roommate in a city that's big on green initiatives. I personally don't like to compost for a slew of really small reasons listed below. I don't have a ton of compostable waste, but when I do I almost always put in the garbage disposal or the trash. However, I feel obligated by my roommate to compost and to empty the compost as it is a shared apartment resource. I want to do neither of these things.  For reference, here are the (I told you, small) reasons I don't compost:   It smells bad, and makes the kitchen smell bad  It's a tiny little compost bin so it fills up extremely quickly (compostable to-go containers can fill the entire thing basically)  Emptying it involves an elevator ride down 5 floors and out of the apartment complex  I cannot (easily?) carry the compost, trash, and recycling at the same time -- at some point its excessive  Compost is the only one that has to be taken back up to the apartment, so I can't just do it on my way out the door  You have to clean the bin. It's gross enough when there's food inside, but I really hate cleaning the sloppy goop afterward  You have to lift the lid, so we keep it on the counter and not under the sink. We're already limited on counter space and I don't want to look at it anyway.  (Assuming the previous points for why I don't compost) I don't feel like I should empty it if I don't use it   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ^(For context, I have lived with my roommate for over a year and we get along fine. The compost is not a huge deal and we haven't discussed it. This is essentially a \"WIBTA\".)\n",
      "TLDR: While training me, my manager didn't inform me of a very important rule that I broke, and we both got fired because of it.  I got hired as a cashier at a store, that's part of a large nationwide franchise. I had worked a few jobs before, but they were all smaller stores, and were not really all that uptight about rules and procedures. But this new place was very formal, they made me sign 20 different forms gave me a giant stack of papers to keep in my records or whatever. I remind you this is a minimum wage cashier job.  I should mention that when you're an employee here, they give you an employee discount card under your name. This is important.  Anyways, I was trained by my manager for a while beforehand. It was early in the morning, the store was completely empty and I had nothing to do. I was hungry and my break was in about an hour.  So I grabbed a snack from the store and purchased it on my own register using my discount card and put it on the counter behind me to eat on my break.  My manager later came to check up on me and when she saw the snack, she asked who's it was. I said it was mine. She asked if I bought it during my shift. I said yes. She asked if I used my card, I said yes. Her face went pale and got extremely angry at me, saying it's  highly  against policy to \"go shopping\" during my shift. I was surprised because I never had this with my previous jobs, in fact I was always encouraged by my bosses to buy from the store, even if it's during my shift. I said I was sorry and I simply didn't know, but she was very worried, less about what I did, but about her boss finding out, because apparently he always looks over the cashier records, and he would see that I went shopping during my shift, since I used my card and it records my name.  That was odd to me because my mom went shopping in this store before, while I'm on my shift, and I let her use my card for the discount. So the cash register should have still recorded me \"shopping\"  during my shift but no one ever noticed that back then?  The next day I came to work and I saw my manager but she was frantically walking around everywhere, worried. I was called in by the office and was fired. I didn't really mind, as it was just a part time job. But I was a little ticked off that no one informed me of such an apparently extremely important rule and just expected me to have known.  I never saw that manager work there again, and a few weeks later, I went back to the store to buy something, and I saw a former co-worker (who was really close to the manager) and she was so extremely cold and passive aggressive towards me, she clearly hated me.  I assume my manager was fired for what I did, and I felt very guilty about it. I never meant for someone to lose their job because of me. But again, I was never informed of such a  huge  rule. Do people just know these things?? I just assumed it wouldn't be a problem since my other jobs were fine with it and I was never informed otherwise? AITA?\n",
      "This all started when my grandpa on my mom's side said that we don't visit enough and we should come for Christmas. All of my family (except immediate family) lives about 5 hours away. Driving there wouldn't be as much as an issue as my family. I am not married or dating anyone, so all I have is my mom/dad's side of the family. I get that most family has drama around holidays, but I'm sick of hearing arguing and fighting between everyone. Me and a family member got into an argument over whether I should go or not. I really don't want to go, but they (my family member) said that it's just for 2 days, and I should suck it up for family's sake. I brought up how last time we all gathered together a fist fight almost broke out and they said that \"that doesn't matter, they are family and your being an a hole\" so AITA for not wanting to spend Christmas with my family?\n",
      "I have 2 closets in my room. This room was originally my parents room, and I had the room they have now. But that room is like twice the size of this one, so I said that it was more convenient for us to switch rooms. We did end up switching and she took most of her clothes out. As I was arranging my stuff in my room I noticed that she still had some of her clothes in one of the closets. Not only that but she had a pole drilled to the wall above my bed with clothes too. At first I tried to take all the clothes to her room and to put them in the closet in that room (since that closet is the size of both of mine combined basically), but it was already full of clothes. I didn't feel like finding a place for it so I let it stay in my room, along with the clothes on the wall. It's been a few years now and she's staying in my room while her and my dad figure out some problems they're having. She said \"well I'll be staying in your room now, I want one of those closets to put my clothes in\" keep in mind, that closet is like 90% her clothes already. She says that since she isn't too fond of my dad at the moment she wants to move into my room and have some clothes in my room to make it easier for her to avoid him. A few of my things are in there, and it's basically only clothes that really can't be folded otherwise it would wrinkle the fabric too much. I told her \"mom, you have a closet twice this size in what's now dads room. You have 3 cabinets in there, filled to the brim with clothes. You have boxes of clothes on dads bed for heavens sake. He still has to sleep on one half of the bed even with you in my room. You need to throw some clothes out or give it away or something.\" She said that I was right multiple times in the past yet she still keeps accumulating clothes. I have one cabinet and basically one closet. I don't think she needs more space then she already has, so I told her I wasn't gonna take my clothes out of the second closet for her. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "my fiance went on a trip early this summer with her friend while I continued to work. My schedule is not flexible and I get limited time off so planning trips together are a big deal and I love traveling with her. She then booked another trip with her friend for September to a destination that I really wanted to go with her too. They didn't actually book anything until very last minute in July and August. While I had kept asking her go with me in June but her reasoning was \"her friend had booked time off work but they just didn't book anything yet\".  She then after booking everything with her friend says she cant go anywhere else for the rest of the year with me because she took too much time off and didn't budget for another trip. S  &#x200B;  o now I can't go anywhere with my friends because it's too last minute for their schedules and she can't with me so I simply will be spending my time at home alone. She thinks I'm being unreasonable and I should just deal with it I told her it wouldve been more fair to arrange one trip with her friend and one with me for the year if she knew that was going to be her limit. She said she'd be happy to still do a short weekend trip or day trip but anywhere with flying or more time is off the limit for her schedule\n",
      "My Grandpa has saved up nearly $90,000 for college and with the college I'm going to it would be enough for six years of tuition and room and board. The deal is that if I have money left over we will negotiate how much goes back to him and how much I keep to get situated in the world. Here's the dilemma, He wants me to get scholarships so that there is more money to return to him (I would use the scholarship money first and then grandpa's money) However I know that very few people can say they got through college without debt and even less with money to spare. I would feel bad taking scholarships from those who aren't as fortunate with college funds.  edit: all the people who are assuming that I am making excuses to not put in the effort of getting a scholarship have trash opinions, I get now that I should focus on my grandpa more than strangers but it's your job to pass judgment based on the information provided and at no point did I say I didn't want to put in the effort of doing so. So stop being idiots and do it right.\n",
      "My friend and I planned to go abroad for a couple of days. I asked him to get plane and hotel tickets and that I would transfer him my share of money. There was an issue with a hotel room because I preferred to get a separate room from him (I’m female and he is is male).   He persuaded me to book one room to save money. He asked me to think about it ultimately letting me know that it’s my decision either way.   I said yes at first but I knew I would be really uncomfortable to stay in the same room with him (history of him confessing his feelings in the past) so I changed my mind next day and asked him to book two separate rooms.  His reaction was that he’s not going anymore and that I should find someone else to go with.   Now, the problem is that he already purchased the plane tickets.   Am I The Asshole for not paying him my share of the plane ticket because I have no one else to go with and because he’s the one who backed down?\n",
      "I work in a creative field where I edit a lot of multimedia, so naturally this is very taxing on my computer. I’m the only person in my team doing these edits. I asked for an upgrade to a better computer because mine was freezing and making me stay back late to do work due to crashes, long waits to export videos, all that fun stuff.   Now, someone else in my team who doesn’t do video or photo work (some InDesign) has been asking for a laptop upgrade for a while, has already swapped laptops before and hers still doesn’t function well, and the IT team don’t seem to care from her account of this.   Due to this I didn’t expect much when logging a ticket about my computer but I got an immediate answer from IT and an upgrade offer. I’m excited (kind of shocked at the reply speed after her tales of IT) but she’s really angry at me for telling her and getting the upgrade. I didn’t expect this reaction from her, but I feel really bad? I got something that wouldn’t necessarily help her as she works remotely sometimes and has a lot of meetings, and I was offered a desktop.   Deets: we both have 7yo laptops with minimum RAM. I’m now getting an old but way higher spec desktop for the office but keeping my laptop for remote/offsite work, meetings, as I do production and need it for photos and editing. I said yes to IT’s first offer even though it’s not “perfect” like a brand new computer or newer model of laptop.   It’s feeling pretty shitty up in my office right now considering I have quite a small team of just three people.   AITA for getting my computer upgrade before her and taking it?\n",
      "Some necessary background: My MIL's father sucks. She grew up in a third world, dangerous country and he judges her for wanting to come to america and have a life. He treats her like she is so vapid, just because she didn't want to join the resistance and risk her life to fight the system. She came the US on her own, and when FIL's business took off she was able to bring her parents over, but he has no gratitude and constantly compares her to her late sister who died fighting for justice. My MIL isn't my favorite person, but he treats her like scum because she wanted to get married and be happy, and because she likes pretty things.   So back to the present, I have a 12 year old son who is gay. My husband and I fully support him and had a talk (without him) with my in laws, because they are old school Catholic hispanics and we were worried they had an issue. MIL said he is too young, but I shut that down and she has never said anything like that in front of him. FIL seemed bothered by it, but he knew better than to verbalize that and for the most part things have gone great.  Last night we had a family dinner. I wasn't in the room so i didn't hear how this transpired, but I heard grandFIL said \"Why did God take the wrong daughter? You should have died instead of your sister\" which is obviously such a disgusting thing to say, especially when MIL brought him here and gives them a lot of financial support. FIL screamed \"if you want my wife dead you don't have to be in my house, you dont have to live off my my money. Get out, you fucking *slur*   Up until he said that I was fully on his side, but my son heard that and got upset. He sad something as soon as grandFIL left and FIL got defensive and said he can't always be perfect, someone just wished his wife dead, this isn't about \"politics\" My son let it go, but when we got home he said that he doesn't want to go there unless FIL apologizes. I support that. My husband told his dad who was furious (I don't think this man has ever apologized) he kept trying to spin it and say but what about my wife, what do you think growing up with that did to her psyche, which I do have a lot of sympathy for MIL, but it is kind of irrelevant. MIL tried to explain to my son that when people are emotional things slip out and when FIL was growing up it was a common insult and how he joked with his brothers, so it is just in his vocabulary and I shut that down real fast.  My husband started to waiver and say he probably didn't mean it, and the situation with MIL's dad just got to him. I firmly told him in front of our son that there is no excuse and I am standing by my son's right to not want to go over there. It is also complicated because I have a 16 year old daughter who thinks it is wrong but is also wavering. She is going out to lunch with MIL today and my son is kind of annoyed, but I do feel like she is too old to not let her decide, and my husband is great at making excuses for his parents.\n",
      "I am 22, male, fresh out of university. I met this senior coworker in his thirties, male, let’s call him K. He seems nice and personable, although he struck me as a narcissist, him and I got along. Eventually, him and I were assigned to a new working location.  This was when the nightmare begun.  Starting early September, K asked if I could lend him money to deal with various issues he had at the time. I did not doubt him (as I witnessed the issues that he mentioned) and willingly lent him the money. He asked me to not mention this to the boss and he had promised to return it on October, when he has his salary. However, he never actually returned a significant sum, citing the boss refusing to pay his salary as a reason. (Reason will be explained in detail later) .   Late October, my boss actually came to inspect the place I’m working at. While K was away, my boss asked if K had borrowed money from me. Apparently, K had also borrowed money from other people working under the org, including the boss, and K had similar practices before he started working here. My boss also warned me to be wary of K, as he is someone who overpromises and never delivers. At the time, I was concerned, because what my boss said was not exactly off the mark, as K had already stalled the repayment multiple times. Out of fear, I revealed to my boss that K had borrowed from me. Before leaving, my boss offered to help me with my payments or advance my salary to settle payments in the off chance K breaks his promises, which was something I considered.  The borrowing continued in late October to early November and it had accumulated close to two months worth of my salary, and it involved some of my family’s money too. It was also at this point in time I was increasingly frustrated with K stalling, as I had ran low on money, to a point where I refused to eat even a single meal for a few days. There are even situations where he used borderline moral kidnapping speeches just to borrow more money from me. Out of desperation, I took the offer that was given by my boss back in late October. However, my boss also directly confronted K, essentially making it clear that I broke my promise with K of keeping the whole thing quiet. This caused an argument between myself and K. He claimed that no matter the reason, betrayal is betrayal and our interaction was hostile ever since.  I will admit that he has helped me on a lot of occasions, some of them were pretty major and he had supported me a little during work. However, I felt like I had to tell on him when he has continuously stalled the return of money to a point where my life was severely affected. That being said, I knew that he had personal issues on his end too, and I probably should have been more tolerant to him.   So this begs the question, was I at fault for telling on K?\n",
      "I (17f) have been friend with the same friend group for over 8 years. For context, I have been diagnosed and struggling with severe depression. My friends are all aware of this though I do not talk much about it with them, only when I cannot hide it. I’ve always tried — to the best of my abilities — to stay respectful and not say anything that crosses their boundaries.   The fight started when one of my friends — let’s call her Britney — threw a party at her house. I drank a lot that night and I ended up having my first ever panic attack. Britney was the one to find me. My friends brought me to a bedroom where they tried to calm me down but Britney was no longer there and according to others, was crying in the bathroom. After that incident, I tried to talk with her and apologize for what she had to see but she refused to speak with me about this.   A few weeks after, I threw a party at my house and talked to Britney about the situation I was in with the guy that I liked, I wont get into it but he and I were in dire need of a long discussion. At that party, I ended up having the opportunity and me and him talked for about an hour. However, we kept getting interrupted by my drunk friends bothering us, including Britney who knew how important this was to me. I got heavily criticized for talking with the guy instead of staying with my guests but I thought nothing of it at the time since most of the guests were sleeping over and I would get hours with them afterwards.  But the week after, two of my friends were completely ignoring me, leaving the conversations when i would enter them and stop talking the second i entered a room. I noticed this and was hurt but mostly I didn’t understand what I’d done wrong. After five days of this, my best friend caught them saying not so kind things about me behind my back. The next morning, when I arrived at school, I was already pissed. I entered a screaming match with Britney in which she told me that “she knew i had problems but she couldn’t even stand to be in the same room as me”. That afternoon, I texted her asking for an explanation and wanting to know what I did wrong so that I could apologize and move on. She ghosted me.  Its been a month and we haven’t talked since. Britney doesn’t care about the situation and has no plans to reconcile or apologize. The rest of the friend group is ignoring this. People are telling me to stop playing the victim and stop avoiding Britney. They say that if there are problems in the friend group its my fault, that I’m the asshole and I should move on and apologize. But Britney wont apologize either and so, why should I forgive? I’m not making this a big thing, they’re just blocked on all socials and its a little tense when were all together in a room.   So am I in the wrong? AITA?\n",
      "I (17F) am in my final year of high school. I want to become a doctor, and that requires a lot of studying, and up until a few weeks ago my parents kept pressuring me to study harder and harder. However, now that schools are closed because of ..you know.., I have to take online classes arranged by my teachers and spend just as much time studying, if not more, but my parents have decided that from now on I am no longer going to attend any classes to take care of my sister instead. With all the stuff going on, I am not allowed to go see any of my friends or my boyfriend, whom I adore and who helps me deal with stress more than anyone, and my parents try to limit my contact with anyone even though the internet.  Today I decided to tell my parents that I am feeling very stressed, just like them, and asked them to let me take at least some my classes in hopes of being able to make it to medical school. I also mentioned that I am confused by the fact that they are now not allowing me to take the classes they pressured me to study for for the longest time. They got mad that I feel stressed, saying that I didn't go through the hardships they have been through, and that I am being ungrateful and accusing them of being bad parents. They also said I should be glad they don't do any physical harm to me and because of that I don't have the right to feel stressed, and they got even angrier when I told them that they were saying my feelings were invalid. They also do not accept any complaint or sign of tiredness, since I am only doing half what they do.  I made my final attempt to share my thoughts saying that the only thing that changed is the fact that I will be learning at home instead of school, I will be just as busy. I also have to exercise, I have enough body image issues, I don't need the stress of getting out of shape too. So I told them. My dad lashed out, and after he yelled at me for a bit I got anxious enough that I cried, and he got even angrier, saying that he doesn't have time to deal with my bs and that I should suck it up and do as I am told because there are people in the world with parents who do bad things them and stuff.  They both refuse to speak to me now if it isn't telling me to do something.  AITA?\n",
      "We're both teenagers, for reference.  &#x200B;  This is a long(ish) term friend of mine that I've known for about 2 years. He's always been pretty edgy, but it's gotten more extreme as of late. He recently went to a mental hospital for a couple of weeks, but didn't change very much. He lacks a filter and says things that are extremely inappropriate pretty much constantly, and he carries a knife around (which he likes to show off) wherever he goes. That being said, we've both done our best to try and support each other through hardships, and we made quite possibly one of the worst classes we've ever taken bearable for the both of us.  &#x200B;  I was messaging my friends, asking around to figure out which date worked best for everyone and adding people to my list of those who could make it, and when I asked him if he wanted to go (and which date worked best for him), he responded with \"idk\". The next day, he informed me that he was busy \"cutting\".  A few days later, we went to hang out at what I assumed was his house, but ended up being a park. We walked around and talked for a bit, and ended up hiking on a trail up and down hills. He also showed me his knife while we were hanging out. This went on for about half an hour before I decided to leave early because I'm very out of shape and was sweating.  &#x200B;  He recently texted me asking when my birthday party was, to which I replied that I thought he didn't want to go. He said that he does want to go, and was in a \"i-want-to-kill-myself mental state\". I told him that I'd have to check if there was enough space for him, then sent him the current list of people (9 people) who are to be invited (in order to stall for time).  &#x200B;  I'm genuinely worried he'll do something dangerous or inappropriate at the party, but also want to be a good friend. WIBTA if I don't invite him to the party, and if not, WIBTA if I tell him there's not enough room, or WIBTA if I was straightforward and told him why he's not invited?\n",
      "I (25F) live with my roommate “Jeff” (25M) in a two bedroom apartment. We share a kitchen and living room. Jeff is autistic and has told me that he doesn’t like his stuff touched or moved from its original spot. Which is fine, I don’t ever touch his stuff or move it anyways.   The problem starts in the kitchen. I cook a lot and therefore use my share of the fridge space. Jeff, on the other hand, eats out more often, but still likes to keep his side of the fridge stocked. Which wouldn’t be a problem, except he buys easily perishable foods: grapes, salad mix, eggs, etc. He will leave his food in there until it’s literally liquified.  The first time I found his food like that I tossed it immediately, after which he freaked out and reminded me, again, to never touch his stuff. Since then I’ve had to practically beg him to throw out his food. Whenever I text him about his moldy food, he’ll just repeat “don’t touch/move my stuff,” even if I send a picture of fruit literally caked in mold.   I left for a trip two months ago and got back yesterday. I guess early on in my trip, Jeff bought some raw chicken and left it in the fridge. I opened the fridge yesterday morning to make breakfast and it was RANCID. All the food on the lower shelves was drenched in liquified chicken. There were mold spots growing on the plastic and it smelled like DEATH.   I lost it. I took every single biohazard out of that fridge and immediately tossed it in the dumpster. I used every chemical I had to completely sterilize the fridge. The whole process took hours. As I was cleaning, Jeff came home and immediately started yelling about me touching his food. I yelled back and told him he’s an idiot for leaving all that food to go rotten. He told me he’s autistic and needs things in certain places and I told him I need a fridge that doesn’t have a Pandora’s box full of diseases. He stormed off into his room and we haven’t spoken since.   So Reddit, AITA for throwing out my roommates food?  Edit: first, thank you guys for all your responses. I’ve read almost all of them and will set up a meeting with Jeff to discuss a cleaning schedule while I’m still living here. I’ll also buy myself a mini fridge.   I also just wanted to say please don’t insult Jeff’s autism. I also didn’t mean for this post to evoke negative stereotypes about autism or neurodivergency. I really appreciate all your feedback and I’ve better learned how to communicate with Jeff.  UPDATE: I reached out to Jeff about a cleaning schedule for the fridge. So far he has not been very receptive. Idk if he’s mad about me throwing out the food still or if something else is going on, but I’m going to reach out to his family and let them know what’s going on in case he needs help I can’t provide. In the meantime, I’m also getting a mini fridge and focusing my cooking on nonperishables. Thank you to everyone who took their time to respond and give me tips, it is much appreciated\n",
      "Such a minor unimportant thing, but it still bothers me. So please give me your judgment!  For my commute to work, I park at a nearby metro station and then take the metro downtown. The station has inefficient (in my opinion) traffic flows, especially for cars dropping off people. For drop offs, you enter on one side of the station, drop the person off, and then exit on the other side (or loop around the station to exit on the same side).  To avoid doing this, some cars will stop in the middle of the roundabout where cars and buses enter/exit the station so that the passenger can hop out of the car. Then that car will keep driving in the roundabout in order to exit the way they came in.  Usually, it's fine -- there is enough room to the left of the stopped car so that cars (but not buses) can just slow down and carefully drive around. But recently, I was behind a big pickup truck who stopped in the roundabout. There was no room to pass him on the left. And since I didn't see immediate passenger movement and felt very annoyed, I honked my horn (once) at him. After the passenger jumped out, the driver rolled down his window and gave me the finger, and held it out for like 5+ seconds as he drove away.  That gesture still bothers me because he obviously thought I was TA for honking at him. AITA here? Obviously the driver wasn't following the rules of the roundabout. But on the other hand, I could have just waited the additional 10-20 seconds it took for the truck to start driving again, and I do recognize that people want to avoid the station's inefficient traffic flow.\n",
      "At school, math classes are ordered from 1 (the top math class) to 10 (or 12, I don't remember the exact number). After each topic, we have a topic test. We also have a mid yearly and a yearly exam.  On a group chat with 4 people- Nicola (15F), Crystal (15F), Emma (15F) and I (14F), Emma texted us, \"I got top of my class for our math topic text\". I've been wondering which maths class Emma was in an distantly remembered that she was in the 10th, but a lot of my memories and incorrect, so I asked \"Congrats. Top of the 10th class?\". Emma replied \"Still\" \"That's good\" (she sent \"still\" in a separate text to \"that's good\").  While I started typing \"Yeah, ik\", Nicola sent a text saying \"Don't be a dick dude, let her be happy\". The whole time, Crystal didn't say anything, but the ticks on WhatsApp showed that she read our texts.  Edit: If it changes anything, I'm in the 2nd top math class.   AITA for asking if she was in the 10th math class?\n",
      "background information: my friend (m18) and i (f16) make silly bets for a few bucks or like favours, etc.  recently, he lost a bet and because of that he had to help me with any assignment for this academic year if i asked.  he made this bet, he agreed to the condition.   cut to: it’s friday, he has a test (not exam, test. it carries no grade whatsoever) on saturday morning and i have a deadline for an assignment on sunday (carries 20% of my final grade)  i tell him i need him to do this assignment for me because i’m busy with something else.  he tells me he has a test and i offer to let it be and do it myself but he  insists  he’ll do it because he wants to “honour the bet”  he aims to finish half of the assignment by friday night. i tell him idc how he divides the work as long as i have it by sunday.  we’re at our favourite cafe and since its a tiny cafe it can only fit 2 parties, we’re seated on the bunker/roof while there is another party downstairs.  i finish my work and move downstairs because i’m starting to feel stuffy.  the people downstairs strike a conversation with me and we’re all talking and my friend also joins in the convo which is cool but then he starts complaining about how much workload he has and he’s stressed he wont be able to finish it tonight and to that i say: “then stop socialising and just get to it, no?” i realise that may sound rude but i mean?? if he’s gonna worry about the workload so much and not even do anything about it, isnt it logical for me to point out that he’s just procrastinating? i understand he perhaps wanted to be included in the convo and since the cafe is small you can hear everything from the bunker so he wanted to contribute but then he was also complaining about the work? i dont know if he was trying to use it as a conversational device but yeah i just pointed out the obvious.  anyway, then these people leave and he shifts downstairs too and he stops midway and says “i need a minute” and i say okay. we start talking abt other stuff and 15 mins later it’s obvious that he’s anxious or just worried so i ask him if everything is ok and he says he’s stressed he wont finish it in time and i say “then stop talking to me and just work” and at that moment he screams at me and like claps his hands in my face really loud.   relevant context: when we first met i told him i cannot have people shout at me bc of past experiences and he knows that. i understand sometimes u just lose control but i doubt this was one of those situations? he said he was just overwhelmed which i understand but i was just pointing out the obvious and not trying to be a bitch. i just dont think i did something so outrageous that his raising his voice at me is justified but he said that he had told me he needed a min and i ignored it but it had been 15 mins since he did.  its been some time but im still pissed abt it bc he knew im sensitive to aggressive reactions.  idk if his behaviour is justified bc i pointed out the obvious. AITA?  edit: realised im the AH, should’ve been nicer because i cant decide whether he gets to be stressed abt something or not. was my job to be his friend first.\n",
      "I dated a guy for ~2.5-3 years and we have been done for 4-5 years. Here is just a small bit of what went down:  He cheated on me MULTIPLE times. I forgave and tried to forget and he went and did it again. When confronting him to ask why, he said it was because I \"wasn't a woman enough\" for not sucking his dick every time he asked or not being in the mood when he was sometimes.  Once when he was really pissed off at me he punched the wall next to my head.  When I confronted him with SCREENSHOTS of messages he sent ex-girlfriends about how he missed fucking them and being with them, he denied it. Pure gaslighting.  Brought cocaine into my dorm in college and when I found it and confronted him claimed it was my roommates. ??? Then later I found more at his apt and when I confronted him he said it was a friend's. I went to the bathroom and when I came back he had it in lines and was snorting it. (I do not condone coke use. I was not happy with this and made it clear.)  The kicker? He told me that I shouldn't get STD testing at my annual the same year I dumped him because I \"should trust him!\" And then later that year, after we broke up and I started seeing somebody new, I went to get tested and had *chlamydia.* So I sobbed and called him to tell him he had to go to a doctor and he BLATANTLY DENIED IT.  I now see a therapist for all of the anxiety, insecurities, recurring nightmares, and absolute HATRED I have of this guy. (Yes, I probably had some form of anxiety/depression prior BUT it came to full fruition with this relationship.)  I am happily taken. But there are emotional scars. He has been dating a new person for ~1.5years and they are engaged. Good for them I guess? But I don't believe he has changed at all and feel bad for the girl.  SOMEHOW, my sister, knowing all that I listed above, still has \"a blank slate\" on him. She's friends with the girl (she was a bridesmaid at my sister's wedding) and my sister is now going to be the maid of honor.  I know that I can't control what she does and her relationship with the girl, but I still feel betrayed for her being in this position. I hate this person with all of my being and my TWIN sister is going to be a part of his wedding. I told her how I felt and she thinks I'm being judgemental of him. ???? AITA here? I'm not trying to get her to now be the maid of honor but she thinks I'm being ridiculous for being this angry and is mad.  Edit: to anybody who commented thank you. I really needed to make sure i wasn't just being selfish w my feelings about this. I don't know how I'm going to approach her or if I'm going to do anything at all but im glad to know I'm not being a dick here for being upset with her. Thank you.\n",
      "I (24F) work at a very small shop as the only employee alongside my boss (65M), who is in a wheelchair after experiencing medical issues. I do all of the heavy lifting, cleaning, displays, pretty much everything aside from the actual transactions. I don’t really care for this job already because it’s retail and my boss talks constantly (especially about politics and controversial things), which makes me miserable as I am fairly introverted. I work Thursday-Saturdays and have never been late, always done more than asked, and basically keep the entire shop functioning.   I’ve worked here since the end of April and taking any time off for something important has been almost impossible. I have missed multiple birthdays, baby showers, an engagement party, and I would’ve missed going wedding dress shopping with my future SIL (whom I love dearly) except that my absolutely wonderful spouse stepped in and said that they would help my boss so that I could go. The one time I absolutely had to call in sick, he gave me some grief about the short notice and then again when I came in the next morning. I obviously can't schedule being sick, but in fairness, my boss can't afford another employee and his wife also has some pretty severe medical issues as well.   I just asked for a few hours off on the 18th to go to a friend’s birthday party (a friend I’ve had to turn down invitations from for months now) and my boss essentially told me that it wasn’t a big deal, that we needed to make better money this month, and that back in his day he missed things all the time for work. He said he doesn’t have anyone else to cover my spot, can’t afford to hire someone else, and that sometimes I have to just “miss the fun stuff.”   I’ve never quit a job (I don't even know how to, honestly), but I’m miserable. I don’t know the extent of potential issues that I would cause by leaving, but I’m finding it hard to prioritize a job over my family and friends, especially as those events are sometimes the only thing I look forward to. WIBTA for quitting (with notice) and potentially leaving behind issues?\n",
      "So much freaking back story here it’s not even funny. I married my HS boyfriend when we were both 18. It was a truly toxic trip that included everything bad under the sun. Married for 6 years until he was sentenced to 57 year felony sentence with no possibility for parole. I divorced him and literally moved across the country to get away from his family. Having said that, I still love him. It’s not a healthy love, but it’s still there.  He remarried in prison, I remarried to a great man, now have wonderful kids and a literal suburban white picket fence life that is light years from my past. Two years ago I got a letter from my ex husband that he’d been severely beat up in prison and needed “just a little bit of commissary money to get him out of trouble. Two years later and I have sent him $150 a month every month. I’m lying to my current husband saying that the money is going to pay for my counseling.   Ex tells me all the time this will be the last time he asks but then says he’s in trouble and has to buy his way out. I have zero doubts he is in trouble, I don’t ask details.  Am I being the asshole here or am I really helping out a vulnerable person who needs help?  Please, please give it to me straight.\n",
      "For some background, I (F24) have been with my now fiancé (M26) for 10 years. His sister(F28) has also been with her fiancé (M29?) 10 years.   My fiancé and I purchased our first house together 2 years ago, have three dogs together (and two cats), sold our first house and are currently building a house. I am also 8 months pregnant.  I have wanted to get engaged since turning 21, not necessarily in a rush but I knew my fiancé was always going to be the one and I was just excited. My SIL has always made the point to tell her brother, he couldn’t propose to me before she got engaged herself.   She got proposed to on Christmas of 2020, and I just got proposed to on my baby shower just over a month ago.   She has been planning her wedding since the date of her proposal and I was very excited to be involved, her proposal also wasn’t a secret because her mom openly asked her about getting her nails done lol. anyway, we have all been very happy and supportive.   So here we are now, both engaged. She is having a big fairytale wedding, the whole nine yards. I on the other hand am not a fan of large weddings or eyes on me, all I care about is getting married to my child’s father and enjoying my day. I plan on having a much smaller wedding.  Her wedding is all planned for a date and I got looking at the calendar and me and my fiancé’s 11 year anniversary falls on a Saturday (2 months after her wedding). I instantly got excited and already know my wedding is not going to take nearly as much planning.   My fiancé’s mom has been pushing us to get married since the day she found out I was pregnant (she is very religious) but now that we are actually here, the family is being very hostile to me saying that next year is my fiancé’s sisters year so.. we can get married (essentially go to the court house) but can’t celebrate until 2023.  My fiancé’s sister also said to him “you have your house and baby coming I need to have this one thing” (she rents).  I’m very taken back by this and honestly sad that it seems like a competition.. am I missing something? Would it be an AH move to plan a wedding for the same year??  Edit: You all are great, I appreciate the comments so far. I personally feel these types of things in life are something to always be celebrated, not need to compete or make things weird. The day I picked for our wedding is sentimental, but I was so quick to doubt my decision because of the families reaction.\n",
      "So my wife and I (both late 20s) were recently married and this is our first chirstmas together as husband and wife. We have a tight little family even though my daughter is from a previous relationship but we are a super close little family. I work two jobs (one job 4 days a week 9-5 and the other involves weekends) all year round and she is a teacher. So spending time together doesn't happen too often but when it does we make the most of it.  Her family are going through some things (her step dad is cheating on her mum and every one is trying to be cool about it (another story altogether)). So step dad is spending time with his piece on the side at new year.  So my wife, her (2) sisters and her mum have planned to go away between christmas and new year, leaving me and our daughter (which again we can do stuff together no problem, I'm a pretty hands on dad). We don't have our daughter on christmas day, so instead we are having christmas day on boxing day and we have her right through to the 2nd Jan. But my other half does charity work and will be feeding the needy on boxing day night (our chirstmas day, I should add that I have no problem helping the needy whatsoever but I see this as our family time and there are other helpers in the charity, this part is selfish I know). So she'll be occupied on our christmas night then is away the day after for 3 days with her sisters and mum.  I've brought up that I wasn't keen for her going away at that time but she got annoyed and said she needs to support her mum. But historically I feel like my other half feels responsible for her mum's happiness through this ordeal even though she has two sisters, one older and one younger, all adults and yes I'm there to be supportive to but I feel like this whole thing that everyone is brushing under the carpet is making life more stressful and affecting our little family life.  Am I the asshole for wanting to spend time with my family? Should I just get on with it? I feel like maybe IATA but I dunno.  (In addition to the affair thing, I'm not needing any advice on it. I've tapped out of the whole situation regarding that and I'm just there to support my wife when she needs it)  &#x200B;  Edit: I should really add that I don't resent my wife whatsoever for her choice!\n",

There were a group of college age women standing in front of where the candy was so I went to get other items on the list and came back over 5 minutes later.   The women were still there so said excuse me a few times but they were too busy taking selfies. After saying excuse me a few more times and continuing to be ignored, I tried yo budge between/around them to get what I needed.   One of the women goes “excuse me.

      "AITA for telling a friend they were wrong for fat-shaming someone in an argument?  I have a friend whom I'll call \"Sam\". Sam was telling a story about a moment they experienced at a club, in which they needed to pass by an area where others were taking photos. Sam was, apparently, visibly annoyed enough at having to wait to pass that one of the people taking photos apologized. Sam replied that yeah, them getting of their way would be nice, to which the other person responded \"Perhaps if you'd asked more nicely\". At this point, Sam snapped that perhaps if the person was wasn't taking up so much space. Sam admitted that this was a curvier person, and that they intended their remark to fat shame them. I am a curvier person myself, and also grew up with a mom and an aunt who were fat-shamed all their lives, so this hurt my feelings a bit. I told Sam that this wasn't their finest hour, and they agreed, but then stated that insults were fair game in an argument. I pointed out that it was more mature to take the high road, and also explained that, had I been there, my feelings would have been hurt. Sam grew quiet, then left soon after. I hugged Sam and apologized for making them feel uncomfortable, and assured them that I still loved them. I did this again over text the next morning, but Sam felt put down by my maturity comment, and annoyed that I made their story about myself. AITA here?\n",
      "My apartment complex sent out an email that they would be bringing thanksgiving food boxes to anyone who responded that could use a helping hand.  My husband and I aren’t starving, we manage to get by using a lot of coupons, shopping deals, and stocking up when we have money (I get paid once a month, he does every other week). The past few weeks have been rough between sickness and hours being cut at his job (I’m salary). We have considered using food pantry’s before I switched to this job but money is still pretty tight on a normal month. We are working to get his income increased and take on extra things like doordash when we need money. He also eats lunch at work whenever he can, they are allowed to eat extra food they don’t serve students after all the students have a plate. I eat very little lunch, today is veggies and a little bit of pita bread and hummus.   Thanksgiving is also a holiday we are “making our own”. My family celebrates later and tends to do a different meal since my siblings all just had Turkey. His family is toxic and weirdly one of the worst holidays to see them is thanksgiving, any Christian holidays they have their best behavior, we avoid most celebrations or visits with them, I don’t think we have had a single thanksgiving that we were there for the meal since we started dating. The past few years money has been at a point we could get to go Turkey dinners from a little restaurant up the street and enjoy them at home but this year will be tight and that may or may not be able to happen.   I also don’t know if it would look bad to accept a food box from the people we are about to renew our lease with, a new company took over just after Christmas last year and while we pay every month on time I don’t want to look like we are out of money(even though we usually are). We are already prepared they have upped rent at renewal but we can’t get get any cheaper anywhere else so money will be even tighter when we renew.  I feel bad taking the food because there are people who need it more, they manage properties that are college students, really cheap areas in other cities, and some units have families not just 2 people.  So WIBTA if I got on the distribution list?  Edit: I’ve Gotten messages asking to use this on other social media the answer is no.\n",
      "My (f24) friend (m23) and I have known each other for about three or four years. Almost two years ago he got into a situation with his dad regarding his dog and was told he had to leave. At the time he lived in Florida and I lived in Indiana, I felt bad about his situation so I drove three days straight round trip to pick up him and his dog. Once we got back I helped him get settled and helped him fill out job applications in the area and after a couple months, he was hired at a pizza place a few blocks down.  Everything was okay for a while, every month he'd ask how much he owed, hand the money to me, and then I'd distribute it for the different bills every month. Unfortunately he was only able to hold that job for about three months before he was fired in January of last year and hasn't worked since.   Ever since then I'd keep checking in on how the applications are going at least once a month, and he keeps telling me that he's been putting in at least one a day. I always offer to help him fill a few out on my laptop, but he usually downs me down. The thing with my friend is he's got like, four or five sugar daddies... at least, and everytime I look into his room he's got more and more fast food containers scattered everywhere. I've asked multiple times for him to see if they would instead send some money for groceries, seeing as it would be a lot cheaper that way, but I'm always told that they would rather just order him food through an app because it's easier?   Here lately I've been thinking about giving him until July to get a job and start paying bills again, or he'd have to move out. The tricky part is my boyfriend has also moved in last fall, and isn't able to get a job at the moment because of medical issues. I'm afraid that my friend would see him having a deadline as me picking favorites with my boyfriend over him, since my boyfriend doesn't have a job atm either.   So WIBTA for giving my friend a deadline to get a job or move out while my boyfriend isn't working either?\n",
      "Hello Reddit! I appreciate any perspective you guys can give me.  I have chronic cluster headaches. If you don’t know anything about them, I encourage you to research them a bit! But to summarize, they are a severe chronic pain condition with no known cure. I am on disability for them. They suck major balls but I still do my best to enjoy life!  I have tried to hold down jobs before but I have always ended up miserable and either being let go because I needed so much time off or quitting because it was unfair to my employer. I am slowly but surely working on getting my degree 100% online — it’s likely going to take me double the time that it normally would because I only take 1 or 2 classes at a time but I’m getting there.  I recently moved in with my boyfriend of 3 years. He has always been understanding of my condition. However moving in has changed things.  I used to spend pretty much 100% of the time in my parents home because I can’t drive and town was 30+ min away. My boyfriend’s apartment happens to be literally a block away from the library! So during the day I have started spending a few hours at the library reading, doing schoolwork, or just hanging out so I can be around other people.  Well this has really upset my boyfriend. I guess he was used to seeing me cooped up inside and that proved my disability to him, but now that I am able to enjoy hobbies and spend time around other people, he thinks I can manage a job. He is mad that I won’t work and help out financially.  My argument is:   When I am in pain, I am not obligated to go to the library, so I can stay home without worry  If my headaches start flaring up I can come home at any time   We are currently fighting and he says I’m the asshole for not trying to hold down a part time job to contribute more financially. I feel really shitty about it and think he might be right.   AITA?\n",
      "Hey everyone,  F22. So I ran into some friends, guys and girls, whom I haven't seen in a while. As I normally do when seeing someone after I while, I went and gave each of them a hug. Except for one guy (M23).  Here is the reason. I kind of liked him at one point, and I think he likes me. He seemed to have lead me on, but he never asked me out, and seems interested in kind of keeping me around as a friend or something, even though I no longer want to be friends. He and I are no longer really in touch, primarily because I got a boyfriend and I could never tell what his intention was. It honestly seemed like romantic first, then friendship, then romantic when I got a boyfriend.  Regardless, in order to avoid causing a further mess, I declined to hug him. He didn't initiate a hug (although he never initiates as far as I can tell) so it's not like I left him hanging. But I am wondering if AITA for hugging everyone in the group except for one person\n",
      "First off I'm sorry about the format, I'm on mobile and not sure how to work it yet. Sorry in advance.  M: Mom K: Ex fiance  AITA for being mad at my mother for how she treated her last relationship/raising my sibling, siding with her ex.  The last few months have been rough, but to keep it short I'll keep it to the last two weeks.   Recently M and K had to put a key lock onto their bedroom door as my brother (16) kept sneaking in to steal money($100+) and weed from M. This happened at least 3 times before they decided to add the lock. He was also warned that the cops would be called to teach him a lesson that breaking in isn't acceptable. Well, he tried to break in. K had warned that the cops would be called, so to at least give warning she told my brother about it. He told M which turned into M getting mad at K for punishing her child. When M got home she got my brother high. This is not long after my brother was charged with possession of marijuana at his school and had a court case on it and is now in rehab for it.   The next event was that K had a funeral and work to go to the next morning and needed it to be relatively quiet to sleep. M decided to invite my brothers girlfriends mom over to all smoke and drink. K got mad as this has happened too many times in the past which prompted M to give an ultimatum to stay or leave to which K left. Now M is holding it over K's head.  This is where I come in. I hear all of this, from M's side at work where where she was telling our coworkers how they split and how K was being unfair and unreasonable, completely leaving out M's part in it. I ended up trying to help K move out, but M got her mother (my grandma) involved questioning me why I'm helping and that K could do it herself. I learned about M letting my brother skip school for days on end, smoke weed and now justifying him taking money. I told M I was upset at how she was handling the situation, pinning everything on K and acting as if M had nothing to do with it. In M's words, \"I need to raise my kids in my own way and not let anyone get in the way of it.\" M has once told me that she wanted to raise my brother to be a smart misfit while drunk one night.   Now M thinks I'm being unreasonable for being mad at the way M is handling the situation and thinks I should think the facts over until I find the truth.  AITA for being mad/frustrated at M and siding with K?\n",
      "My girlfriend is working on her first startup. She is wonderfully smart and has an idea I can only describe as industry defining.   The issue is that she struggles with scaling from 0-1 (although I expect with her corporate experience she will dominate in going from 1-10). As a result she requests my help, which is fine, but she asks that it be given specifically in ways she receives best.  Some history: I’ve always grown up believing that if you ask for help, you should be thankful as long as you receive it. I hated it when a family member or parent would ask for help doing something, like the dishes, then criticize me for doing it differently than how they do it. I’ve always been under the impression that giving help when requested is a “gift” and when receiving a gift of someone’s time, you should be thankful unless they are rude or grossly irresponsible with their “help.”  Some background on me: I’ve scaled and sold a startup and did pretty well for myself so I have experience here. I’m not just talking out of my ass. At the same time that can make me pretty stubborn because I do know what works. And I’m autistic (on the asbergers side of that) so I can be tough some times.  Now to some specifics:  She might ask: “hey can you help me build this website, but please don’t give me examples of websites I don’t like.” I respond with “ok, but making a list of sites you don’t like might help give guidance to a developer on what the site shouldn’t look like.” She freaks out to this and says that I should give her advice the way she wants to receive it and that not doing so after clearly being asked to is an asshole move.   It’s worth noting I was not a great boyfriend in the past and have been in therapy for years but she has been wonderfully understanding. It’s reasonable for her to want and expect me to be patient but I can’t get over the fact that it feels wrong to have her get angry at my for helping her after she asked me for help. Help isn’t about getting exactly what you want; it’s about getting something helpful in the realm of what you are looking for.\n",
      "To begin with, it's kind of complicated. In my friend group there's me (24F), my best friend \"Hank\" (24M), a married couple \"Dan\" (24) and \"Kendra\" (20), \"Laura\" (25), and \"Victor\" (28?M). Dan is best friends with someone named \"Jack\" (UKA M).  I didn't like Jack when I first met him because he seemed kind of rude and standoffish, but after a talk we reached a point where we could at least be around each other without wanting to be snippy. He told me that I seemed unapproachable which is why he never talked to me, and I told him that I'm not social enough to instigate a convo unless I am close with someone.  Anyway, A few weeks ago, probably a couple months ago, Jack and Kendra got into an argument about how we never play anything except Smash when Jack is around and he made a comment about \"how [they'll] only do what [she] wants from now on\", which was not the point in this argument. We (Kendra, Laura, and myself) were only trying to express that we wanted to play other games with Dan, Victor, and Jack other than Smash.  So he storms out of the apartment and doesn't really bother apologizing to Kendra for going off on her.  Cut to now. I recently purchased a house and Kendra and Dan moved in with me and took one of the bedrooms and will be paying me rent, as will Hank and Victor when he moves in. Ever since the fight, I haven't wanted to be around Jack or even see him because of how biased I am against people who use gaslighting/emotional abuse/mental abuse to get what they want.  Even Hank as asked me if I'll be okay if we do any outing with Jack involved. Dan's got some stuff going on and I know he feels bad for keeping Jack out of the loop, but with how gossipy Jack is and how rude he can be, I don't want him around. Really, I don't even want him in my house.  At the end of the day, would I be the AH if I told Dan and Kendra I didn't want Jack at my house and I didn't want to be associated with him anymore?  Edit 1:  So apparently once he warms up to you he's buddy buddy but he does like to gossip. I honestly forgot to mention that. I was briefly in the argument bc I was trying to get him to see Kendra's POV but it devolved to him verbally attacking her. Also,  from what I've seen and heard from Victor, this is definitely Jack's MO. Bc he doesn't know Dan's situation, he's been giving all of us the cold shoulder and only hanging out with Laura.  Edit 2: I definitely used poor wording. I don't want to tell them to stop being friends with him, just that I don't want to hang out with him. I greatly misworded that and I am sorry.\n",
      "I (54F) have been married to my husband (50M) for 27 years. I have a tense but OK relationship with my in-laws. They come to our house & stay in their RV once a year which has worked for all in the past. We are now empty nesters and possibly traveling to husband’s hometown. I do not want to stay at his parents house. I can be nice & cordial for a few hours, but more than a day or two, and I’m not very nice. We have stayed with them in the past (in their RV), but we always had the kids with us to diffuse situations & stay IN the house. Even so, if I needed a break and went to the RV, my absence was noted & commented on, making me even MORE uncomfortable.   Husband thinks I am being unreasonable because we have always stayed at his parents house in the past. I have offered that he is welcome to go to see them without me and stay there - no drama, no guilt. He says no. It would be weird for him to go without me. I don’t mind going, but staying overnight at their house is not good my my mental/physical/marital health.   My husband thinks ITA. I may be, but really don’t think so in THIS occasion.\n",
      "So my (26m) parents (early 60s) are separating. Their agreement included my dad getting the house and buying my mom’s share of the house out from her. She has legally until February 10th to stay in now his house, but he has allowed her to stay as long as she needs to. She has secretly decided to move to Florida which is over 1000 miles away from where she currently lives. She told me about her plan around two weeks before she wants to move (around February 10th). She wants me to drive with her and help her move her many pets down. I really don’t want to.  Our relationship has been a little weird since I gained independence and realized some of the toxic and warped ideas that have been ingrained in me since childhood. When she told me about her plan, it seems to entirely depend on me helping her. I am not her only child and feel as though it’s her saying “he has nothing else going on”. She wants me to take a week off of work, rent a van or SUV to transport two medium sized dogs, three cats and four to six turtles while she drives her own car. She’s had her belongings moved down to her new place so it’s just the pets. She has told me that she hopes I will also take the time to visit family down there because it will be nice to see them. Then I’m expected to hop on a plane, from Florida, to fly back home to my mid Atlantic home state.  The very idea of everything she has presented to me is suffocating. It’s been five days since she told me and I had left our last conversation off with “I need time to think about it”. My sister has since tried to contact me and I know she will try to convince me to do it. AITA if I don’t help my mom do this?

      "My daughter recently got a scar on her back which needed stiches. It isn't bad and healed quickly. Its supposed to be removed yesterday but she wants to go to a hospital and i dont. I dont feel like the AH but her brother is on her side so i want unbiased opinion.I think its fair for me to remove them since i already removed my own stitches before. Her argument is that she trusts professionals, i think she's being paranoid.I keep asking her why cant she trust me and she keeps saying she wants it done at a hospital and she trusts doctors more. I dont get why i need to go to the hospital for a 1-2 minute procedure. The scar is like 2 cms. It isnt that bad. Now she is pissed at me, i told her if she doesnt let me do it then she can let it rot and she just said 'OK'.We havent spoken since then.  Edit: i took her to a hospital today.\n",
      "My(36) mother(56) is diabetic and has an anaphylactic reaction to gluten sometimes. Other times she eats it with zero reaction at all. Often its somewhere in between with hives and an itchy throat. The worst reaction occurred while she was hiking in the woods with my 14 year old daughter and step father. She required an ambulance and three epi pens to save her life. While in the ER the doctors gave her hell for eating food that she knew she was allergic to but offered no help with diagnosis and treatment of an eating disorder. She has asked many doctors but has been told over and over again that she is not over or underweight there for she just needs more will power.   She was recently diagnosed with cancer and her emotions have been going nuts, understandably. In fact there is some evidence that the hormones released from the tumor may be the cause of her allergies but there is no way to know for sure.   Shes always veiwed Holidays and special occasions as a chance to \"treat\" herself with things that she knows are bad for her. She also deals with stress by eating food that she considers treats.   I know that I make a lot of choices that aren't the best for me, but my mother will always be the first to call me out on it.  It's not my intention to call her out but I do hope that if safer options are presented to her she will choose them over things that could harm her, so WIBTA if I show up with a couple of gluten free side dishes and a gluten free dessert to our family  Christmas dinner. I haven't been asked to cook anything and she is the only gluten free person in our family.\n",
      "Am I the asshole for not telling my previous lover’s girlfriend about what he is doing?  Two years ago, I matched with a single man (he said). We met several times and had some great experiences. Then he told me he was not single and had had a girlfriend for 10 years. I ended the relationship but he talked me back into it. We had an affair for 9 months until I ended it again. Finally done with not being number one for a man. The thing which bothers me now is that this man’s girlfriend is semi-famous in my country and she posts a text every day on Facebook talking about her happy life, her great boyfriend, love etc. I don’t know her personally. But I know for a fact that he has been picking up more than 20 random women via his two fake Tinder profiles. And that he is still communicating/meeting with some of them. I do not ask you to evaluate my affair with him. But in stead: am I the asshole for not telling his girlfriend that he is unfaithful to her? So far I haven’t done it because I feel it is none of my business.\n",
      "I(23m) don't really know how to describe it, but I am very uncomfortable with my face and body in pictures and videos. It's not like I have any sort of scarring I'm ashamed of, and I'm not super overweight. It's just that seeing my face in photos or videos I didn't know were being taken triggers my fight or flight response.   My mom is a photographer at heart, and loves taking photos of just about anything. After I expressed my discomfort to her, she was very understanding, and made an effort to let me know what she was posting or just that photos were going up. It's not really her that's ever been the problem, though.   My grandmother cannot for the life of her take a good photo of anyone, not even just me. It's not even just that every photo she takes of someone is unflattering in some way, but she also will just sit there and take anywhere from 30-70 photos or 10ish minute videos of anything happening around her that she deems interesting. My mom and I have both explained how uncomfortable it makes me that she does it, and she simply refuses to listen under the guise of \"I'm an adult\" or \"I am entitled to whatever I want of my family.\"   I've discussed reporting some photos and videos of me she's posted to Facebook, but it just seems like a very dickish thing to do, even if she hasn't listened to our concerns, so wibta?\n",
      "This sounds so stupid, but here it is.  My boyfriend and I were walking to get lunch.  He asked me where I wanted to go and I said the only thing I was craving was Frankie's.  We had Frankie's together once before about two years ago and he got a little sick and anxious from it so he said no.  It's the best pizza in town so I said \"You should really try it again sometime\".  It didn't have to be now, but it's been two years and most foods make him sick so I really thought he should give it another shot.  It's not like I demanded it.  He said \"Fine, I'll make the sacrifice and get sick for you\" in a completely serious, spiteful tone.  One of the main things that bothers me in our relationship is that every time we do something I like that he doesn't I have to hear about what a sacrifice he is making as he mopes around not even trying to enjoy whatever it is.  I would never say something like that and always act like I'm enjoying whatever we're doing and try to actually have fun, even when it's something I don't want to do.  We've talked repeatedly about how much that bothers me so I don't understand why it keeps happening.  If something is that much of a sacrifice, I'd rather just not do it or if we are going to do it, not have to hear about how miserable it is.  I know when we're doing something he doesn't love so I really don't understand his need to constantly point it out. He says he wants to make sure I'm aware of what a sacrifice he's making, but I feel like being constantly reminded makes it so I can't even enjoy whatever it is.  He is insistent that here I am in the wrong for suggesting we do something after he said no and that I don't understand his reasons for not wanting to, but I think it's no big deal because all I did was suggest he try something a second time after 2 years.  Now we're in a huge fight because I can't get past the fact that even for something as small as getting lunch I still have to hear about what a sacrifice it is and his insistence that he is right to point out every time he makes a sacrifice.  He's still mad that I insisted he try the place again when he already said no and that he feels like he can't say no.\n",
      "Backstory. I own a company with someone else. We have used this lawyer before to make a contract for us and it went great but was a little spendy.   Later on an ex employee decided to sue us for bogus reasons. I took the  notice straight to this lawyer. We worked it out and provided documentation required and from that point in never heard back from the other lawyer. We recieved the bill for all the work done and paid it in full.   Flash forward to 4 months later where we have assumed it was all good and moved on. I get an unsolicited email, as in I have never reached out since then. \"Dear client, I just wanted to email you to say that since we still have not heard back I will consider this matter closed. They must have dropped it. They can reopen it if they want for this long of time. Thank you.\"  I simply replied \"ok thank you.\"   Today, a week later, I got a letter in the mail due for $38 for them emailing me their message...  Would I be the asshole if I made a big deal about paying this? Its not about the dollar amount. I just dont feel like theh have any right to charge me for that.

      "My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and he’s dyslexic, at least he has all the symptoms of it. I noticed it after a few dates that he was really slow when reading, and I showed him an article that was only a few paragraphs and it took him like 5 minutes to read. I asked him about it and he said the letters get turned around, which pretty clearly is dyslexia but he refuses to get tested or see a therapist or something for it.  It’s pretty annoying sometimes when we’re trying to get somewhere or order dinner and he takes forever to read the menu. Sometimes if he’s reading out loud I’ll just read it for him to speed it along.  Today we went out to lunch at Panera and we were second in line. There was a little sign that said something along the lines of “credit card machine broken, cash and gift cards only”  It took him nearly a solid minute to read this. I’ve talked to dyslexic people before and none of them are this bad. He had to pronounce-out loud- every word. About 3/4 of the way through I said “take your time” because we were about to have to pay. He got really upset and left without me. So I get lunch and head back to work, and when I get home I called him and he ripped into me about how disrespectful it was.   If he would just get tested I would have some sympathy, but he’s just being difficult. It was a harmless joke.  AITA?\n",

But then some time later he comes into my room shouting at me for not knocking, which would be bad BUT, his room door has this coloured card thing on the door handle and it was on green so I don’t think it was wrong not to knock.   Well tbf I’ve never seen him actually change it to red so at this point it’s more or less there for decoration, but still if he wants privacy he should make use of it.   I tell him that, But he still goes on saying it’s still common sense to knock before entering someone’s room no matter what. And to “use my brain.”\n",
      "For the sake of this post. The dad who raised me is stepdad. Bio dad is just dad.  My dad died before I was born. He and my mom were married, he got sick and died soon after, which was while my mom was still pregnant with me. Mom met my stepdad when I was 11 months old and they got married when I was 4, but he was raising me most of that time. I grew up calling him dad. I have his last name (my mom changed my last name when she got married). I love him. For a long time I considered him my only dad but in my mid-teens I started to feel more connected to my dad. I read the letters he left for me and really did feel a sadness that I never got to know him. Not that I loved my stepdad less. But the loss did hit more when I was about 15. I was lucky to have my dad's family in my life and at that time I did start to ask more about him.  I think my stepdad was a little hurt about my interest in knowing more about my dad. Jealous, even. He never said anything to me directly back then but I could see he was very uneasy. My mom never minded. She would talk a bit about dad too.  I think where the current issue comes from a couple of sources. I am marrying a man who shared the same last name as my dad. My last name was changed and I have admitted to my parents once or twice that it makes me sad they didn't keep my original last name. The fact I am now getting that through my marriage is something I feel could be upsetting my stepdad.  But on top of that, I feel like he's allowing his jealousy to rule here.  So my parents gave my fiance and I a wedding gift early which is a replica of their wedding album and wedding invitation, just kind of wrapped a little more pretty (has decorative stuff on it). We accepted it but it made me curious and I had asked mom privately if she could give me her and dad's as well. I said call it a gift or not, just I would like that. She was fine with it. But then when my stepdad heard I wanted it both of them said no, and that I was rude to ask given the circumstances. I was sad but said I understood. My stepdad did not like the sadness and asked me if *shitting in his mouth* (which are the words he spoke) was worth it. His anger was very clear.  AITA?\n",
      "So at my school I am at the bottom of the food chain when it comes to popularity and this one kid, let's call him Mike, is very popular and he likes to bully me for my struggle writing due to my joint hypermobility syndrome. I have to use a laptop which is why he likes to say things such as \"shut up you can't write\" \"imagine not being able to write at age (my age)\" and \"disabled freak\". This has gone on for 2 years now and I have tried reporting this to teachers but they just tell me to ignore it every time. In this particular situation I was already being annoyed by one of his friends, I tell his friend to stop and Mike says \"shut up you can write you freak\". I don't know why but I decided to get back at him, i thought 'if he picks on me for something I'm insecure about for 2 years me calling him something he is insecure about once must not be as bad' so I said \"calm down fatty\" he went mad (obviously faked) \"I am extremely offended by that\" and all of his friends played along, the teacher overheard and sent me outside. I argued my case and she said we would both be in a lunch detention so I thought that was fair enough but Mike should still be punished more for the long run of comments he made to me. The teacher then asked some other students if Mike really said what I said that he said and they all said no. Turns out all the people the teacher asked were mike's friends! So it was after class and I ended up having to apologise to Mike and he got off Scot free and he didn't even have to apologise.\n",

I (29f) live with my husband David (48m), our baby daughter (1f), his kids Tyler (20m) and Lily (8f), as well as my daughter Luna (10f). David and I met in a support group for people who lost their spouses and children. My first husband died in an accident in 2016. Three weeks later, our son died during birth. David lost his wife, Hailey, and two daughters in a house fire caused by a neighbour. We bonded over the shared experience of loss, grief and raising children on our own, and somewhere along the line, when we could allow ourselves to move on, we became a couple.  We've had to build our relationship on hard work and good communication from the get-go, because growing together as a family after our losses and managing five people's very different ways of grieving is really hard, let me tell you. Also, we are almost 20 years apart and there's no denying that that's challenging as heck, not only for us but also for the people around us. Especially Tyler, understandably, had a hard time accepting me at first, but we have a good realtionship now. This will be important later.   Hailey's mother is very present in her grandkids' lives, but she is very distant towards me, which I understand. She has told David that she wonders if he would've swapped her daughter for someone younger even if she was still alive. This hurts David to no end, because there is no way in hell he would ever have left Hailey. Still, we try to be understanding, because she has lost her daughter, and we of all people know what that's like. What worries me, though, is that she has made clear that she only considers Lily her granddaughter as long as Lily doesn't see me as Hailey's replacement. She was a baby when Hailey and her sisters died, so she doesn't have any memories of her. But she loves and talks about her mother a lot, which we encourage.  This brings us to our current problem. Lily and I have a very strong bond. I love her to bits and Luna and I include her in almost all of our mother-daughter activities. A couple of weeks ago she started to call me \"Mama\", which never happened before. I think it's because our baby daughter has started to call me \"Mama\" (though sometimes it's aimed at the dog or her sisters' cereals). My oldest daughter has always called me by my first name because she has autism and ist quite fixated on names, so this is the first time Lily hears someone call me \"Mama\".   At first I was really touched, but Tyler's reaction changed my mind. He was absolutely heart-broken, although he tried to hide it. I talked to him and he said that it hurts him, but he is also happy that his sister has someone to use that name for. He also reminded me that their grandmother will probably not want anything to do with Lily anymore if she hears her call me Mom. Lily adores her grandma. It would break her heart.  So, Reddit, WIBTA if I stopped Lily from calling me \"Mama\" to save Tyler, their grandmother, and ultimately herself from heartbreak?\n",
      "My (43M) daughter (17F) was recently hospitalized for anorexia. I had my daughter from a previous marriage, but married my now wife (40) when my daughter was 12, in addition to me having a having a daughter my wife also has a child(14 M) from a previous relationship. So for the last 5 years, we have lived together as one family. After visiting my daughter in the hospital, I came home and my son was in the living room playing video games with two friends, as I was taking off my boots near the garage door, I hear one of my son's friends bring up my daughter to which my son replied \"yeah, well at least she isn't a fatass anymore.\" This sent me in a an immediate rage. I was so mad, I made both of his friends leave and explained to him why that wasn't okay to say. He showed no remorse and kept saying that I was overreacting to a joke, I ended up grounding him and sent a text to my wife letting her know what had happened. My wife got home and was upset with me for not understanding that \"he was just being a clown in front of his friends\" and kept stating that it wasn't anything serious that he was just being a boy and that I overreacted. I don't think that I overreacted regarding my rage, but did that situation deserve a punishment?\n",
      "TLDR: Daycare provider cancelled care for personal reasons less than 24 hours after accepting payment for the month. Called out on Facebook for being hostile & “not understanding” after getting upset, apologizing & then requesting a refund.  Our care provider for our youngest son abruptly cancelled care for the entire month of April (and going forward) on the 3rd day of the month. She’s having a mental health crisis & has some other things going on in her personal life. I was upset with her when she told me, but I immediately apologized when she informed me on what was happening with her & have been nothing but cordial & polite since. She found us spotty care for the next 2 weeks, but after that nothing, leaving us with at least a week with no care, and scrambling to find a new daycare after that. (Which is incredibly difficult where we live)  Thursday we asked if she would pay us back for what we paid her for April, less the care she did provide. This is upward of $750 that we can’t afford to throw away.  Yesterday she posted a rant on Facebook about how we were hostile & aggressive and don’t support people with mental health issues. I’ve barely spoken to her since the first time & it was definitely not aggressive. She also told my devastated 3 year old that it was my fault she couldn’t take care of him because I was mean. My older son confirmed this.  So AITA for asking to be paid back so I don’t have to sacrifice our savings because I won’t be able to work for a good portion of the month?   EDIT: she has refunded us already, just wondering if I should have asked in the first place\n",
      "Throwaway because he knows my user.  My partner (28m) had a job interview this morning and was told on the spot that he got the job and was sent home with some paperwork to fill out.  I’m soo happy for him (and me 27f) as he’s been unemployed for the last 2 months, so I’ve been supporting him and the new job is waaay higher paying than his last job!   Anyway, he brings home the paperwork (standard new employee stuff) and asks me to fill it out for him as my writing is neater than his and he gets a bit nervous filling out documents and tends to make errors which upsets him.. I fill it all out for him and show him so he can check it and sign everything.  He sees that I have put myself down as his emergency contact and flipped out at me, saying I should have put his dad down instead.  I asked him why his dad should be his emergency contact when we have been together for nearly 7 years, we live together and I’m 8 weeks pregnant with his child... his response was that if something were to happen to him, his dad should be the first person to be notified (????)  I made a smart arse comment and said “I wonder if your older brothers have your dad down and not their partners/wife” and he said it doesn’t matter because he wanted his dad down, not me.   He’s super pissed at me now because he doesn’t want to cross out this whole section of the paperwork that I’ve filled out with all my details and is too embarrassed to ask for another copy to fill out.   AITA for expecting to be his emergency contact?  Should I have clarified this with him first?  I just feel like we are adults and have been together and living together long enough that it makes sense.  I know I put him down as mine for anything so I’m just confused!\n",
      "I (17m) was on FaceTime with my friend when he told me his girlfriends mom was saying I was in a gay relationship with this kids who seriously harassed me.   For some context, we all go to the same boarding school. the who bullied me, we’ll call him “a”,  a was a friend of mine who started to get very controlling. He would get mad at me for not hanging out with him and his friends enough and say all my other friends were fake. one day I got in a fight with him, I basically said I’m done with this shit I don’t enjoy living around you. A little while after I came into my room and saw all my clothes in a pile and a cum stain on my jacket. He denied it and even licked it off to show me it wasn’t him… I have my doubts.   Eventually I moved out of my dorm and became roommates with another, we’ll call him g.  G got into a relationship with this girl and one day on FaceTime g told me about how his mom had heard some weird stuff about me from his gfs mom about me and “a” having a gay affair. I didn’t think much of it until some more stuff came out. She teased me about being gay and asked my friend g if I had a romantic relationship with a. Eventually I talked to her daughter, g’s gf, and told her that I thought her mom must be pretty bored with her life to be making shit up about me. This lady’s like 50, she needs to focus on people her own age. Her mom eventually called up my mom and said she thought I had no empathy and basically made me apologize for saying she was bored with her life. She doubled down and said that everything she said was totally plausible and that she can say whatever she wants in her own home. She thinks my friend, his mom and her saunter are close confidants and is mad at g for saying anything about it.\n",
      "My friend started a boutique,  I created her a logo, business cards, social media posts, ect. She would say \"totally giving u all the discounts\" or stuff like that. I don't mind doing this for the discounts, since I enjoy doing this stuff and it's what I got a degree in. However, I went to her boutique to shop and she DIDNT give me a discount or even offer one. No biggie, i was kind of annoyed, but got over it. The next week, she texted me wanting several graphics for her social media. Now, I work a full time job and I am in grad school as well.  How do I politely bring up the fact that people pay me for this, or offer me incentitives without coming off as rude? Or is it too late? Should I have brought it up earlier?   &#x200B;  HELP!\n",
      "Please forgive the formatting, I'm on mobile and it's almost 2am here.  Okay, I was with my dad and my little sister in the car and I was driving us home from work. Since I was the one driving I didn't answer my phone when my brother called so he called my dad instead. My dad told me that my bro's asking what sub I wanted out of the two options that he bought. I asked if he could order me a small pizza instead because I wasn't a fan of the subs ( I haven't been for a while, we have a conversation about the subs almost every time because I use to like them before something about them changed) and he said he had already ordered the subs and they are at home. I said that it was alright and that I would make myself a grilled cheese sandwich and told him thank you anyways. My mom from the other end said that I was being mean.  Once I got home my mom asked me why I wasn't eating the sub and I had to explain again why, to which she said I was being mean again. Am I missing something? I did thank him for the sub. I just didn't want it. Did I have an attitude? To me it just felt like, \"Hey, it's fine! We all make mistakes! You can have my sub for lunch tomorrow and I can make myself something!\" Everything seemed fine afterwards... Like nothing happened. I'm just kind of confused about what happened cause stuff like this doesn't really happen and all of us are pretty close. AITA?\n",
      "I (27f) live at home with my parents due to mental health issues including severe PTSD. I am not a fan of physical affection. I don’t know if it’s from my trauma but I don’t like giving or receiving any type of physical affection. I’ll do hugs with family members and that’s about it. My mom, who has some of her own issues, has become very nasty over me refusing to give her a kiss goodnight. She doesn’t always ask for a kiss but most of the time when she does I refuse and she glares at me and tells me I’m being heartless and mean. I don’t know what to do. It makes me extremely uncomfortable to kiss her on the cheek but she did give birth to me and raise me. I know physical contact is really important to my mom and it hurts her feelings that I don’t reciprocate so I feel like I might be the asshole\n",
      "The titles a little confusing. So me and my boyfriend had this date at the movies planned, which I was really looking forward to since we never go on dates. He comes around around 5:00 and the movie starts at 8:00 so he lays on the couch and we’re just watching the TV.   It’s at this point where he falls asleep. I had just gotten home from a 7-4 shift at the hospital and all he had done all day up to this point is sleep. It’s around 6:00 when I try to wake him up, and he refuses to move. He says he’s not going anymore. I continue to try for the next 20 minutes to get him to move and he refuses to move or talk to me.   I still live with my mom and my brothers, so I asked my brother if he wanted to go, so I just left my boyfriend there sleeping and went to the movies with my little brother who loves the Marvel movies anyways.  My mom ended up coming home and kicking him out, but now he’s pissed. I’m just wondering... am I the asshole?\n",
      "My Brother and Mother want me(26NB) to attend my Sister(40F) wedding but I can't really understand why I should, given that my Sister & I are estranged. I'll preface this by saying I'm Autistic & have agoraphobia.    The Background  : My Sister is the oldest of 5, I'm the youngest. She moved out of the house when she turned 18 but still kept in regular contact with my mom & the rest of the siblings. I don't have too many memories of her though. The ones I do have, I remember being awkward & the overwhelming feeling of having to watch what I said, cause I always felt dismissed by her. I was always told she cared for me & the other siblings a lot. But when I started to reach my pre-teen & teenage years, she really wasn't around much anymore. Only coming over when we looked after her dogs, for holidays or birthdays.  After a negative event on my 16th b-day, I kind of gave up trying to form a bond with her. I felt that we were just too different of people. Im the type that believes you chose your family. It doesn't matter to me if you share DNA with me, if I don't feel a familial bond, then we aren't family. The last time I genuinely spoke to her, I was around 18 & that was cause our mom was in the hospital.  Brother(30M) is different. He did form a bond with Sister & kept in regular contact with her. Brother is the only one of my blood siblings that I've kept a bond with. He and I grew up together mostly just the two of us with my mom, so I cherish him greatly. He got married 3 years ago and I saw Sister at the wedding. It had been 4 yrs since I spoke with her and thought maybe things would be different given that I was now an adult. But nope, still felt like a stranger. We don't really know anything about each other as neither of us made an effort of reaching out to the other when I became an adult.    The Wedding  :  She really wants me there cause according to my Mother and Brother, it would mean the world to her to have her family there. Shes having a huge traditional wedding. The only people I would know there is Brother & Mother. I've been to weddings before for my Brother and Uncle, but they were people I knew & loved. But I don't really know Sister. Brother and Mother have framed it as \"Go cause it would mean a lot to us that you would be there for someone we love\". Mother also bring up that I would be missing out on a once in a lifetime event & possible relationship with Sister who is \"a really amazing person\".  A wedding is a HUGE tax on my health. I don't live in that city anymore either. I would be traveling hours to go to a wedding of a stranger, be surround by strangers,& be misgendered all day (Sis knows Im non-binary but still uses gendered language regarding me)     The Question  : Would I be an asshole saying I don't want to go to the wedding and I don't want a relationship with Sister because I see no value in building a bond with her or putting my own health on strain for her wedding, even though it would mean a lot to Sister, Brother, & Mother?\n",
      "I’m 27w pregnant and I’ve just been diagnosed with moderate-severe perinatal depression. For several reasons but mostly for the baby, I have decided to wait until the baby is born to take SSRI anti depressants as I don’t want to subject my newborn to withdrawals.   I have been warned that the depression may get worse, especially after he is born. I will also be having a repeat c-section so I will be post surgery and starting on new medication which can take weeks to take a full effect. I also have an energetic 20 month old and I am self employed.   My husband was planning on going to his BIL to be stag (bachelor) party in Amsterdam about 5/6 weeks after the baby is born, initially just for one night. I felt somewhat ok about that, but now he has decided on 2 nights (& 3days).   I’ve really been struggling lately, and I have no patience with my toddler and on occasion have had to walk out of the room feeling like panic attacks are coming on, all symptoms of the depression. I dread spending time alone her and feel such horrible guilt about it and I also have pretty bad insomnia for the last 2 months so I’m exhausted.   My main fear is that I just won’t be able to cope with a newborn and toddler for 3 days without my husband. It isn’t the same having my mom come over to help out. Anyway, my husband is mad now that I didn’t tell him all this and he thinks I’m just being insecure about him going to Amsterdam. I used to be that way but I’ve changed, I’m more worried about my ability to cope and the panic attacks are scary. Plus all the what ifs of this pregnancy.  BTW his sisters and BILs wedding is 2/3 weeks after this stag in Spain so he will be going abroad for that but he will be bringing our 2 year old with him so I think it will be easier to cope then…\n",
      "so i (28m) kept running into my coworker's (30m) wife (23f) at the gym and at parties. she kept mentioning she was looking for gym partner (preferably female) but none of her friends had the same schedule as she did. i volunteered and she said great. we came up with the plan that i would come up with a workout one day, and she would come up with a workout the next day. the first time i actually went with her and her husband. he and i work different shifts so it was one of his days off and he often goes to the gym. it seemed to work out well, and he taught me some different workouts. we ended up doing shoulders and back.   the next time we go its time for shoulders and back again because of her school schedule. she does the work out and struggles to keep up on a few of them. she makes a comment about me getting impatient while shes finishing up the last of the set. i ignore this, but i do start thinking that shes kind of bitchy.   the next day it was her turn to come up with the work out. she says lets do a leg day since we havent done one. she wants to start out stretching, which i think is dumb. i oblige her anyway, and draw the line when she says she wants to do a run on a treadmill. she gave me some spiel about wanting to be able to run with her puppy when he gets bigger. i roll my eyes and tell her im going to do shoulders while she does that. she starts getting upset and said that we had an agreement and that she didnt like all of my workouts either, and then she started talking shit on cable machines. she said that she likes compound exercises more. i tell her i need a spotter, and she keeps trying to go back and do legs. i tell her that i need to do shoulders every time i go to the gym. she then says oh youre one of those short guys. you know getting wider isnt going to make you look taller, just shorter. (now i am short. im about 5'3. her husband is actually shorter than me though, and shes taller than us both) i then tell that was disrespectful and that i work out for my mental health, and shes not even good at working out just judging how much she struggled with shoulders and how little she knows. she then says she should leave until i can calm down, and maybe this wasnt a good idea to be gym partners, and then proceeds to say that she had pegged me for someone who is insecure. she also mentioned that her husband is much better at the gym than me and left.   when i see her husband during the shift change meeting at work, i pull him aside to talk to him about it. i tell him the story and he says he thinks im being the asshole and its unprofessional to bring up his personal life up at work, and he would have been happy to talk about this in a more personal setting, like over a beer. he also talks about how i need to man up and not expect him to \"handle\" his wife.   so am i the asshole here?\n",
      "I (26F, living in Indiana) dated a guy (28M, we'll call him Zack) I met on a dating app for 6 months. At the beginning of us dating he told me that he had applied to the University of Alaska to get his master's degree, but he didn't know if he had gotten accepted yet. We continued dating, and became really close, really fast, to where we were spending almost every day together. We took trips together and I even invited him to my best friend's wedding. I don't want to jump out and say it was love, but it felt in that ballpark. Come to find out, Zack did get excepted to the University of Alaska and he still wanted to go. In the months leading up to him leaving, we still dated, but were never \"official\" because of the fact that he was leaving. When we were saying our goodbyes on the night before he left, he asked me if I'd go to visit him and I yes and asked him if he still wanted to come to the wedding. He also said yes. Fast forward to a few days before he flies back for the wedding. (This is where the questionable assholery comes in.) My friend's mom gets a life threatening case of Covid, so the wedding is postponed. Although I was sad for my friend having to postpone her wedding I was still looking forward to seeing Zack. I text him that the wedding is being postponed, but we could find something else to do together. Wrong. His first response was \"shit, it's too late to get a refund for my plane ticket.\" Seeing this, I asked him if he was still coming. (Because who wants to throw away $450 and plans that were made months ahead of time, just because no wedding is taking place.) Zack calls me and says he thinks it'd be better if he stays in Alaska to catch up on his homework, but if I had no plans for the weekend I could fly up there and we could spend time together in Alaska. I told him I couldn't because it was too last minute and I didn't have the money at the time to buy a plane ticket. He said okay, and didn't really seem upset. We hung up and texted the rest of the night. I didn't tell him, but I was upset that he wasn't willing to come visit me when he already had a plane ticket bought but wanted me to drop everything last minute to fly to him. For the record, I'm not condoning him for wanting to keep up on his homework. I just feel like if he was behind, he could've just told me before the wedding was canceled so I wasn't getting myself excited for two months. AITA?  Edit: To be clear I did plan on visiting him sometime in the future, but when I had time to plan, possibly take off work and actually have the money to travel there.\n",
      "So I've just graduated and will start working in the fall about an hour away from home. I'm in a huge rush to move out, not just because I want to be in my own space and get ready for work, but I don't have the best relationship with my mother, and this whole Covid-19 situation has only exacerbated it.  My mom is super clingy and very much an extrovert, while my dad and I are introverted nerds. This means my mom will text me every hour when I'm working to see when I'll be done, force us into family night activities, and generally want to be around all the time. My dad is somehow nowhere to be seen when it's time for a grocery store run, so I go with her. Most recently, she'll come to my room and wake me up out of a dead sleep to eat breakfast with her, or watch the Price is Right, or literally just sit on the couch and hold hands or whatever inane thing comes to her head.  There's also some unresolved issues from my high school days concerning food and health. I didn't always have the best relationship with food and eating healthy but being away in college has massively helped me, and I only had to deal with my mom when I came home for break. But now that I'm here for much longer than I anticipated due to the pandemic, I have to deal with my mom monitoring my food intake every day, mostly because she's upset with her own weight loss stuff. She'll make comment about my body while I'm just walking around the house in sweats, or comments on my eating habits like \"you know if I were you I'd cut back on the carbs\", or even worse \"you can eat whatever you want, but don't expect me to sit here and watch you kill yourself\" when god forbid I decide to have some chips or a pudding cup. It's really gotten in my head, and I feel myself starting to drift backwards in my relationship with my body.  Since I'm at home, I was refunded some of the rent for on-campus housing at my university. Once I found out I'd have more money than I thought saved up, I determined that I could afford to move out in July or even in June to live with my best friend near my job. But both of my parents think I should save the money and move in a couple of weeks before my job starts. I know it may seem a bit reckless, but honestly a month of rent seems to be a fair price for peace. I've done the research and found several great apartments, and I can afford everything on my own without help from my parents at all. I know my mom doesn't mean to be mean or hurtful, I genuinely think she can't help it because she's anxious about me leaving the nest, but I don't really want to sacrifice my feelings for hers right now when I'm about to start a huge important phase of my life.  TLDR: mom is intense and kinda naggy, and I wanna move out early. AITA?\n",
      "Long time lurker here, throwaway account. Not a big deal, but somewhat complicated, so please bear with me.  I will try to make this objective rather than blow my own horn because I really want to know what you fellow redditors think about this.  So, my wife and I own a flat in a really nice part of town (we are not rich, just mortgaged to our eyeballs, we just make ends meet). For 6 months, my wife's younger sister has been living with us as she is doing an internship here (she normally lives in a different country). She pays no rent, contributes a little bit to the household. It is important to know this is not an issue. She is family and in our family this attitude - generosity & helping each other as much as possible - is normal.  During the Xmas break wife and I intend to travel for 3 weeks. So the sister asked if she could stay in the flat with her BF (who would fly in) for a week. I have zero problems with her staying, the issue is her BF.  This is the tricky part to explain. BF is a not a bad guy, harmless, kind. The catch is that, how to put this, he looks out for himself. He is very happy to be on the receiving end of attentions, favors, and the we-take-care-of-each-other family treatment (e.g., he's stayed at ours a number of times here and in a family home during the summer), but not much, if anything, ever comes back. Don't get me wrong here, he will pay his dues that are clear, for example he'll pay exactly the part of the car hire that he owes; he will bring a Christmas gift, but the bare minimum required (while very happy to get nice gifts himself). He's the kind of guy who is gracious when you pay his lunch or coffee, but never offers to pay for you himself.  There was an incident that kind of puts this into sharper contrast. When my wife with our little boy (<1 year at the time) had to visit the city where sister and BF live, she was staying in a friend's completely empty apartment (long story) and needed to get a bed for herself and the little one. It was agreed beforehand BF would help. Well, over a period of days before wife had to sleep there he found no time to help so my wife eventually had to make a last minute IKEA trip alone with her mom (and a baby in tow) and drag a bed to the flat.  I know enough of the BF background to understand that he's probably learned nobody would take care of him, so he has to. But now he’s been on the receiving end for a good 2 years, maybe more, and he ain’t changing. The sister is overprotective of him (‘poor BF’) and if anyone raises this with her, she gets defensive (tried that route, does not work).  I am not quite sure what to do. I don't want to be petty here, but also don't want to feel like an idiot (remembering the bed incident still makes me want to detonate). It doesn't cost us much to let them be here and it saves them tons (getting an Airbnb here would cost them about £200-300 per day; they do not need to stay in town, though, if we decline they will probably just go home).  So, WIBTA if I said sorry mate, no go?  Edit 1: we are deciding this together with my wife (not my unilateral decision), I am just the one asking Reddit\n",
      "I (25) recieved a text from my Mom on Thursday asking of I could get her something from the dollar tree. I responded, yes of course - I will go the following day during my lunch break and check. Queue me going to the closest one to my job, they were out of what she was looking for. So after work, I go to the one on the way home and they also don't have the item (seasonal). I let her know I went to two in the area to look and couldn't find it. She says check another store in the area, I say of course I don't mind. Its out of the way but I don't mind doing that for her. That evening I had plans to help my boyfriend with his small business, and also the next morning (Saturday) I had to help him with an event setup. So Saturday afternoon, I was going to go to the dollar tree and look for the item. She calls me Saturday Morning saying she was at a painting party with a friend and asking me if I found the item. I explained no, that I was helping my boyfriend and was going that afternoon. She gets angry at me and says \"Well you should have told me, I would go then. Its Saturday and everyone is out, so they will all be bought up.\" I felt so hurt by that, I already went out of my way to look at 2 different stores, I had the best intentions at heart. She never asked me if I had any plans going on, so I had assumed it would be okay for me to go on my own time, not within what she thought was a respectable time frame  (it wasn't a time sensitive situation). I went to the dollar tree that afternoon as I told her and found the item she was looking for and let her know I got them. I knew I would be seeing her the next day on Sunday for Father's Day so I messaged her and let her know I would give them to her then. The following day I give them to her and let her know I dont appreciate the phone call harassing me to get this item for her when I was going above and beyond to do this for her. She then says she feels I put my boyfriend and friends above her and that she is second fiddle to them. Which isn't true at all, and I told her that and even said, if I didn't care about you I wouldn't have done this for you. I was so upset by this that I left shortly after. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "I have been living with two roommates for about two months now. Recently one of my roommates was pretty rude texting me about how she doesn't want me to move her stuff and calling me names. While I understand the sentiment and would normally agree, she leaves her stuff in the entryway for days using it as a pantry (when we have a pantry). Not to mention she has legit piles of recyclable trash at the doorway too because she hasn't gone to turn the recycling in for money yet. The issue I'm having is that I am simply moving her stuff to the appropriate area for it like moving her groceries from the entryway to the pantry. She was very upset however and I don't particularly want her mad at me but I am also tired of our entryway being cluttered with her trash and groceries constantly. AITA? What should I do?\n",
      "I live in a small house that's owned by my parents. I don't make a lot of money, and I'm back in school, so this is a huge way they're trying to help.  Just before Christmas last year, an old friend who I hadn't seen in probably 15 years reached out on FB asking if he could spend a couple nights on my couch. I have a second bedroom, so I said sure.  I pick him up on the side of some road, in the freezing cold, where it's clear he hadn't showered in weeks. All of his worldly possessions fit into two trash bags. I felt terrible about this, so the few days turned open ended. I wanted to help him get back on his feet.   About 2 weeks later, he asks to borrow my car to visit his mom. I let him, where he proceeds to total it. My brand new (to me) car that I hadn't even made the first payment on, was now crushed by the tree he ran into. He had no injuries. I had no gap insurance (another long story). So, now I'm on the hook for about $3k.  He's very apologetic, and I believe him when he says it was just an accident. So, we make a plan for him (my parents were involved in it) to stay and, in lieu of rent, he would make payments towards the outstanding balance on the car.  About four months later, he finally finds a full time job (at $10/hr). He hasn't paid a dime for anything up until that point, including groceries, toilet paper, etc. That was all coming out of my already tight budget. So, we sit down and come up with a monthly payment of $562. This would be for the car, and a little help with utilities, and to cover the phone with service I had given him. This was literally his only \"bill\" for the month.  Four months after that, he had now only paid about $1k in total. He always had excuses as to why he couldn't give money: his mom needed to borrow some, he needed to buy stuff, etc. All really flimsy excuses. Here's a grown man that didn't understand that bills came first - just a part of being an adult. But, there seemed to always be beer in the fridge (which I didn't buy because I don't drink), and he would disappear on the days he didn't work. I know he's a recovering addict, and I'm pretty sure he was falling back into it, though couldn't prove it.   So, I'm talking to my mom on the phone one night, and I finally tell her that he's not meeting his end of the deal. She's livid, and immediately texts him that he has two days to get out of the house. Unfortunately, this happens to be his birthday. But she doesn't care. So, he moves out and takes a bunch of stuff that didn't belong to him, including a sound bar and the tablet that came free with the phone (as long as you maintained service, which was now being cut off, so I'm now making the payments on). Hell, he even took the trash bags that he didn't pay for.  So, am I the asshole for kicking him out? I'm also considering taking him to small claims court for the balance he owes. As far as I know, he still has the same full time job.\n",
      "So, I spent today scrolling through this thread kind of debating whether to post this or not but here we go.  My mom died when I was 6. My parents had divorced a little before that, for... many reasons. My dad remarried and I have a brother that's 4 and a half years younger than me. My relationship with my stepmom has been complicated and very rocky to say the least but she loves me and I do love her and she is the closest thing I had to a mom... But growing up there was a clear preference toward my brother. He was spoiled by them (which had cause tension between us as I resented him for that, we've since fixed our relationship and are very close). But they weren't the worst of it. I had a grandma from my mom's side and a grandma from my dad's side, but both have died more than a decade ago. My stepmom's parents are alive.  Stepmom's mother... is a literal Saint in my eyes. She always treated me the same as my brother. If she gave him a chocolate, she'd give me a chocolate. Equal treatment for everything. In fact she's the only one that treated us the same. She always considered me her granddaughter. I consider her my grandma and I absolutely adore her.  Stepmom's father on the other hand was the complete opposite. He has been obsessed with his grandson since his birth and there was always a clear difference in how he treated us. From gifts - he bought my brother a bike, a laptop when he was 12, phones. To the point where one time when I warned my brother he hadn't locked his bike, he said 'it's fine if it gets stolen grandpa will buy me a new one'.  Then the behavior as well, his way of talking - with me he was always extremely passive aggressive and dismissive. To the level that it looks like a joke but it's not one.  For this reason, I never felt close to him. I never considered him my grandpa, because he never treated me like a granddaughter. I honestly feel 0 emotions towards him. I'm fine with this. I'm an adult now.  However, recently my brother told me that his grandpa has been complaining how I love our grandma more and how I never talk to him. My brother has tried getting me to try more with him cause he's old but... I don't want to. I don't think I owe him anything just because he's old now and maybe has regrets. Heck, he didn't even come to me with this but talked to my brother. But I am a softy so I do feel some guilt over this decision.   So, AITA for not really wanting anything to do with the step grandpa? Or is it understandable?  EDIT: Should mention that stepmom has been guilting me about this too saying his time here is limited and I should stop being a stubborn and talk to him more often.\n",
      "So today morning I was getting ready for school when I over slept and I didn't study for the test I have today so I decided to take a day off but there was a problem. My mom is very strict when it comes to school she likes ny grades to always be the best and she wants me to get into a good college in order to save my family from poverty but my grades have been going downhill recently.  Needless to say I am one of the worst students in class and I feel horrible whenever I'm in school so I really didn't want to go today and to make it worse I had to rewrite my computer exams today because I failed so I really didn't want to go today. So I decided that hiding my uniform would be the best idea considering she can't really put the blame on me then but I was wrong she told me that I hid the uniform and that I'm doing this so that I can skip the exam (she doesn't know that I'm rewriting it and that I failed)\n",
      "My boyfriend (26M) travels for work every week to a city well-known for its nightlife. He's been having a great time going out at night and always says he wants me (26F) to join so that he can show me around.  We've been trying to figure out a good time to travel together and decided on this week. The plan was: I join him on his flights and stay in his hotel room. I \"work from home\" in said room during the day, and he meets me after work to show me around. He said he had a lot of fun ideas for dinner and drinks. He's been very busy lately (often works late). So I told him several times that I only want to join if he won't be working late on the 2 nights that I'm there. He insisted it would be easy to leave the office around 6pm if he told his coworkers that his friend was in town.  On Tuesday, I work from the hotel room. I ask around 3pm when he thinks he'll be leaving the office. He says he should be back by 6:30pm. Cool! 6:30pm rolls around and I get a text saying that he's still at the office but is packing up to leave. No problem! I calculate that he'll be back around 7:00pm and start to get ready for our date night. 7:00pm comes and goes but he's not back. 7:30pm hits and I get a text from him: \"still at the office but should be leaving soon.\" This is when I get upset. It would have been easy to text an updatee but instead he keeps me in radio silence for an hour. I'm done getting ready so I sit on the bed and put headphones in to relax. A little after 8:00pm I check my phone that's been facedown to reveal 2 missed calls and a text from 1 min ago. The text says that his room key didn't work and he knocked on the door. I go to the door but don't see him, so figure he went to get a new one. A few minutes later he walks in and says sternly \"WHY DIDN'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR.\" I say that I had music in and my phone was facedown. He then asks if I've picked a spot for dinner. What? He was the one that had \"so many ideas.\"  At this point I'm pissed. The silent pissed where you don't want to talk to the other person. He left me waiting and then got mad about a small inconvenience. He sold me a vision of him leaving work around 6pm for us to grab dinner and go out, yet shows up to the hotel after 8pm. He says he has ideas but doesn't.  By the time we get to dinner it’s 9pm. He asked what my issue is to which I say that I don't want to get into it there. He calls the waiter over and asks for a check and a to-go box halfway through the meal. On the way back to the hotel he says that I have no reason to be mad at him for working late, I've ruined the trip, and that I'm a mean person for not talking about it at the restaurant. Still pissed, I say that based on how I'm feeling now I don't want to be here and would rather take a flight out by myself in the morning. He didn't talk to me after that and hasn't texted back today even though I'm still here. AITA? Are my expectations too high?\n",
      "My best friend (17F) and I(19F) are a bit of a stand off right now, and I want to know if I was and asshole for asking for space.  This all started in the beginning of July, when I broke up with my ex. It was something the two of us decided mutually. My best friend, Nicole for story purposes, felt as though she was in the middle since she was dating my ex’s best friend. I told Nicole that my ex and I are on good terms and there are no sides and that my ex and I are still friends. That weekend I ended up going to a party and I kissed a guy.  This is where things get a little crazy. The guy I kissed and I never took it any further, and I told Nicole this- i also said I contemplated going for more. She proceeds to tell my ex about this. Nicole and my ex ended up blowing things all out of proportion, and they ended up calling me a few choice words.  At first I was confused as to why it was a big deal until Nicole told me that my ex told her that we were planning to get back together- something I said i would be okay doing years from now with my ex. Because the two of them are in my close circle I tried to make things up with them, and because to an extent I understand where they were coming from.  Fast forward to about two weeks ago, I ended up hooking up with the guy from the party. I didn’t tell anybody because I didn’t think my sex life was really anyone’s business. Last week Nicole found out and told my ex.   I FaceTimed her and I asked for an apology because once again she said some very hurtful things about me, and I knew none of the things she said about me were true. She didn’t apologize and so I said I needed some space from her since she can’t respect my boundaries when it came to my personal life.  Now my friends feel awkward talking to me since Nicole has been talking bad about me again behind my back and they think I’m an asshole. I’ve never said anything about her.  If you guys need more context I’ll try to edit some in, this is just my first post and I have no idea how to go about it.  Just an Edit: My Ex was completely understanding when he and I sat down and talked about everything. He told me Nicole made it sound like I was planning on hooking up with said guy since before my ex and I broke up. He and I are still close since the breakup was mainly about the fact that we worked better as friends than otherwise. My main concern was with Nicole and I really appreciate all the advice I’ve been getting! I’m taking it all to heart, and it’s always nice to get another perspective!\n",
      "Background:   BF (27M) and I (25F) have been together for over a year and a half. BF was briefly married 8 years ago to exW (28F) and had 2 kids before divorcing in 2012. She has really nothing to do with the kids, hasn't seen them in over a year, won't hold down a job, and mostly just couch surfs and smokes cigarettes and weed. Despite this I am always cordial when we are at the same place. BF has custody of the kids but gave temp custody to his parents due to his work schedule. We don't live together.  The situation:   Last week exW and her friend showed up to BFs apartment needing a place to stay for a couple days. Friend's mom had kicked them out and said she just needed to get in contact with her dad. I wasn't happy, he wouldn't cheat but she's the kind of person that would try to get him to cheat for the drama, but ultimately it was just going to be a couple days.  Now it's changed to them being homeless and have nowhere to go. ExW doesn't have an ID and neither are looking for jobs, BF said that they'd probably stay there until they found a different couch to stay on or a new dick to ride (his words), but he doesn't have a problem with them staying. He calls it helping the homeless and to be fair he has helped a few of his friends in the past when they've needed a place to stay for a couple weeks. They've been there a week and they've done nothing but sit on the couch, watch TV, and smoke (outside).  My problem is that they (exW and friend) don't want me around and have made it very clear that they don't want me around. He wants to \"help the homeless\", I want him to kick out the freeloaders. He thinks I'm being callous and irrational but I don't see how he doesn't see that they're using him. We've been fighting for 2 days about this and I'm really reconsidering our relationship - essentially he is choosing his ex wife over me. She has family and could ask them for help but is choosing not to, instead she's crashing on her ex husbands couch and he's letting her. It's going to be months before they ever leave, if they ever leave.  He cancelled our date last night because they were there and rescheduled it for this weekend when they plan on being out of the house for a while. I'm angry that he is working our relationship around her schedule and am refusing to have sex with him while she is staying there, whether she is physically in the apartment or not, because I don't want to sleep with someone who makes me feel like a dirty mistress sneaking around behind someone's back.  He's annoyed that I'm upset and is acting like I'm being a heartless bitch for not being ok that they stay. If they were actually trying to improve their situation and didn't try to ice me out of my relationship it would be one thing, but that’s not the case. AITA?  Tl;dr: boyfriend's ex wife is freeloading and causing a rift in our relationship, he doesn't see it.\n",
      "A bit of context.  Wife has worked about 3 of the last 8 years, i been paying almost everything, and while i earn above the average of our area, wife is always finding ways for us to get into more expenses, to the point that we have absolutely no savings and some debts.  About 4 months ago, wife got a job thru one of my friends, he told us it could be a temp job, a month later wife tells me she signed a 12 months contract, i asked her to verify it and treated me like i was dumb and why i was doubting her.  So based on that we enrolled the kid on a private school that offered free childcare after hours.  2 months later turns out it was a temp 3 months job, i ended up in the hook for a year of private school, and if we want out we have to pay 60% of the yearly cost.  While she was working she started to plan a big bday party for my kid, i started paying debts so i told her i could only pay for the food a set amount, initally we agreed 30 persons, now its 30 kids + adults.  Also our dryer broke, car needs repairs and house need some repairs.  Now that she is out of work, she is mad because i only gave her the amount we agreed a small amount more, she is demanding more, because there are some suppliers that need to be paid that day, most probably i will end up paying for it.  But the amount she needs will make us either get behind in debts again or go into a bit more debt.  AITA?

      "AITA for not attending my Husband’s Grandspa’s funeral?  So this sounds terrible… but basically my Husband’s grandpa passed away 4 days after our wedding. He suffered from Alzheimers and was sick for about 2 years before passing. And my husband has made peace with him passing long before ge passed away. My Husband and I were on Honeymoon and paid a lot of money for accommodation etc. The honeymoon was 15 days and we left the day after the wedding so we’ve barely been away.  The funeral was not in our hometown so it would have been additional costs to travel and book accommodation for the funeral. This wasn’t the problem though. I asked my husband if he wanted to attend the funeral and he agreed that he did not want to be saddened on our honeymoon and that he really wanted to take this time to take a break from the world, especially his father (go see my previous post on the wedding drama)… he basically said that he had made peace with his grandpa passing long ago as he had to go say “bye” several times in the past when they thought grandpa wouldn’t have made it.   My husband said the funeral would be made about FIL and not about the grandpa so if he went it would be to support his father (who was supported by his favorite son, Let’s call him John) rather than mourning his grandpa. FIL has a way of pushing me away and also makes John seem like the favorite in front of my husband so it situations like this it is tough. Also read more about Betty in my previous posts… basically there is a lot of fresh drama in the family we didn’t want to face on our honeymoon.  Fast forward to now… FIL is upset that we didn’t cancel our honeymoon of 2 weeks to support him. Sister in law didn’t attend either as she was sick and Betty and John (Brother in law and his girlfriend) did attend. So AITA for staying on honeymoon and not attending the funeral? Keep in mind this is not any vacation, it was our honeymoon.  I’ll answer questions in the comments.\n",
      "Sup, I recently did some Christmas shopping and I gave my brother a pair of converse for Christmas. I told him he could open it up early and wear em around. He informed me he didn’t have any money and couldn’t buy gifts for anyone this year because we both had COVID and couldn’t work. That was perfectly fine by me, but that was a month ago and we’re back to work.   Today we got paid and he asked me to drive him to a hobby shop to get some models for himself since he doesn’t like to drive. I noticed he got a car model kit and I asked who it was for. He told me it was for one of our friends. I got kind of pissed off and asked him if he considered to even get our mom a gift and he told me he didn’t even think to. I’m pretty pissed that he thought about getting our friend a gift before our mom and I don’t think he’s going to get anyone in our family gifts.   WIBTA if I took his converse and just wore them for myself?\n",
      "I work in a co-working space. There is a front desk and couches near the desk where people sometimes work. Around the holidays, towards the end of the day, the delivery guy brought a bunch of packages. I noticed that one was a fancy cheesecake that needs to be refrigerated. The cheesecake was towards the bottom of the packages and not all that noticeable (I just recognized it because I love it).  I was concerned that the front desk person might not notice and it would be left out and wasted. The front desk person was not there but there was a woman on the couch. I said, excuse me, but there seems to be a fancy cheesecake among the packages. Would you mind letting the front desk person know. She said, yes, I would mind. It's not my job.   I was like, okay, just trying to be helpful, hate to see it wasted. And she replied that I could put it in the fridge. That wasn't going to work. It hadn't been tracked yet by the front desk person; there wasn't room, things would need to be shifted around, and three, I had to leave because daycare doesn't mess around when it comes to parents being late and I was already behind schedule getting out the door. There also wasn't paper and pen around to leave a note.   Luckily I ran into the front desk worker on my way out and mentioned it and the cheesecake was safely in the fridge overnight.   So AITA for bothering someone to ask them to tell the front desk person something?\n",
      "The title may seem horrible, but please read, before commenting Characters: My brother - B , My Mom - M, Me- Me  So yesterday, me and my brother got into an argument with our mom, while at a store. The argument started, because we were joking about something at the store, she got mad at us, told the cashier something not very polite about us (joke about how we were retarded) and we didn't open the store door for her. So M, told us she wouldn't drive us home (our house was like 2 km away, but it way freezing cold and raining). When we were walking away, M told us to shut the car doors, or we'll be punished at home, so I shut the doors. So she says \"OP, you go into the car, B, you walk\" But one thing I knew - I wasn't leaving B alone. so I asked \"Can B come too?\" \"No\" \"Then I'll walk with him\"  She was in shock as I walked away with B. So we went home And she and my dad yelled at us for not opening the door for M. While she left us to walk home in cold and rain. Me and B argued with our parents and ended up both getting punished. And, I feel kind of guilty right now, because despite everything M is still my mom, and she is a good mom, except when she's mad. So I have to ask you AITA?\n",
      "So, I’m a white woman (21f) who lives in the southern us. I took an interest to foreign languages in highschool because it seemed like something important. I speak Spanish and English fluently, since those two are the most spoken languages in the us and it seemed important to learn Spanish. I also speak Chinese very well but not as well as a native speaker.   Anywho, my brother has been dating this girl Luisa for several months. He’d mentioned her family is from Mexico. They moved in together recently and threw a housewarming party.   It’s worth noting that my brothers best friend is Hispanic, his family is from Cuba. My brother speaks a bit of Spanish, he can follow conversations decently, and knows his fair amount of insults. When I get to the party I start chatting up my brothers best friend, and we’re talking in Spanish. It’s something we’ve just done for years, we primarily talk in Spanish because ‘use it or lose it’ and all that. My brother and his girlfriend come over and I said it’s nice to meet you, and I include them in what we were talking about. All of this being in Spanish.   His girlfriend is named Luisa and her family is from Mexico, and I’d heard her speaking English with a bit of an accent when I came in, so I incorrectly assumed she spoke Spanish. She kinda went off on me about how not everyone speaks Spanish. And that as a white girl I don’t need to be speaking it. My brother later apologized and said it was a sore spot for her.  But it’s been on my mind, AITA for assuming she speaks Spanish when she doesn’t, and speaking Spanish in front of her?  Edit: I did try to apologize for assuming but she kept yelling at me and then ran off to the other side of the room and went to shit talk me to her friends\n",
      "First of all, English is not my first language, so I'm sorry if i have some mistakes un the text.  I (29M) have a group of friends J (29M), R & C (both 29F). We studied together since kindergarden to high school senior year. Since then, we barely saw each other because we were living in different cities. We are back in our city of Origin and we decided to hang out some weekends.   One of those weekends, another former classmate and friend -let's call her D, 30F- invited us to her birthday, she had recently came back from another country where she was living because she wasn't doing well and didn't have documents. To cout a long story short, she and her mom where talking about how difficult was their situation, how difficult was finding a job for D -she never finished college and the only job i knew of her didn't last more thanntwo months-. After the birthday reunion, we went to a restaurant with her and we payed for her Food, which didn't like R and C.   A week later, D texted me to recharge the credit on her phone, with the condition that when her mother got paid, she would replenish the money. I was surprised because although this was not new to me -I saw her doing this kind of things at school many times-, I could not believe that at 30 she hadn't changed or matured and the most surprising thing is that her mother continues being the same. I said no and I told her I didn't have money in that moment.   I wrote a message to R telling this and she told me what some other people from school told her about D -the fact that she and her mom always play the victims, who are aware of money and taking money from people. We finally decided to not invite D anymore. A 4 months have passed since then, and a few days ago, D texted J, asking him why do we go out and don't invite her. He was upset because acting like that at 30 is inmature. I told J that we just can't pay for her everytime, and R & C told him that D gives them very Bad vibes.  D is angry with us. We haven't explained the reasons why wey don't invite her, but she is always saying that she is hurt, that feels ignored, etc. J & I are starting feeling bad for her because we know she doesn't have anybody else here, but we are adults, and we now understand that we can't keep this kind of people around us...  AITA? Are we TA?\n",
      "I am in high school and wanted to get a job. I applied to many places. About a week later I got a call from the trampoline park. The next day I went in for an interview and got a call from them later telling me I got the job. This trampoline park is far away from my house and the hours are strict. You are also required to work weekends.  Two weeks later I got a call from a grocery store asking me to go in for an interview. So I go for the interview and get told later that I got the job. (I did tell them I was working at the trampoline Park) This grocery store is a five minute walk from my house, has extremely flexible hours and I was referenced by a friend meaning if I stay there for six months he gets a $250 bonus. The job I was most hoping for was this grocery store so I told the trampoline park that I quit and started working at the grocery store. AITA for quiting a job I just got.\n",
      "I'm not trying to be r/iamverysmart but, I've always been above average with academics, namely math and science. my older sister always disliked that and came up with excuses about why I was ahead of her when I'm a year younger.  When I was in year 10 we tried more difficult math as I wasn't learning and she wanted to get ahead. I moved up two year levels from year 9 to year 11 (level one) and she moved up one year 10 to 11 in math 2 years ago, she stopped competing over math a few years before, and at the end of last year dropped back a year to do calculus, as originally she'd gone into statistics (I was in calculus so we didn't worry about class over lap). All was good until this year I joked about visiting her physics class to confuse the teacher. She didn't know it was a joke, she wasn't listening fully, got really serious and said \" Don't. \" after I told her it was a joke she relaxed a bit and I laughed it off. She said it some more times over the next couple days about not doing physics, at that point I had no intention on doing it.  Right now I'm in 13 calculus (level three) I'm ahead of the year 13's and working on my own thing, my year 12 calculus teacher came up one day said I should move into year 12 physics (level two), I dismissed it because of my sister but wanted to do it. The next day I had my second science lesson, the first one was boring. I found out it would be recap for at least half a term and probably more, I just felt constrained. I thought about moving up to level two physics and possibly level two chemistry. That evening on the way home I casually mentioned moving up in science, my mum was immediately hooked and started sorting out the details with me. Up until this point I hadn't seriously thought about moving up, just some maybes in my mind. My mum sorted out the class changes and I got moved up into the subjects (my mum is a teacher) and it turned out there's only one physics class and one chemistry class so I'm in two of her classes. I attended one physics lesson when my sister was sick and that's all I've had.  Today I went with her to her job interview to calm her a bit she was thankful. When we got home, because I thought she would take it better when she was happy with me, I just out right told her. I didn't want to just show up one day in her class. Now she's furious with me and I don't know what to do. I don't want to make her sad, but I didn't do this to piss her off, so I'm kind of annoyed she got upset. Am I the Asshole?  &#x200B;  TL;DR: My one year older sister really didn't want me to move into her science classes and told me repeatedly not to after I joked about it, but my classes weren't teaching me anything and I felt restrained with learning, so I did. I ended up with her in two classes, she's now furious and I don't know if I'm in the wrong.  &#x200B;  Edit:Grammar and a detail.\n",
      "My school has a system where if you miss 10 days without school permission, you get excluded. If you're late, it counts as half a day that you missed without consent. Moving on...  On Wednesday, I (16M) woke up at 7:55am and only had 20 minutes to prepare for school. Our school is a 10-15 minute walk and lessons start at 8:30am. Luckily, I prepare very fast (takes me around 10-15 minutes) and at 8:10, I was ready. But my brothers, Paul (13M) and Sean (11M), woke up 10 minutes later than I did and were super slow.  \"Hurry up!\" I say. My mum steps in and said \"Wake them up earlier then.\" Reasonable, I guess. We left at 8:25 and had to run to school. No one was late.  Thursday. Same thing. Woke up late (7:50am), but this time, I woke my brothers up before I even used the bathroom so to avoid anything this time. At 8:10 I was ready to leave but somehow they  were eating breakfast . I got frustrated again and told them to eat quicker. Mum steps in again and tells me to \"stop being a whiny, useless big brother and help them make their packed lunches.\" I pointed out that we woke up at the same time and there was no excuse for this, as I have packed lunch too. This quarrel went on for about 10 minutes. I then left with only Sean at 8:27am.  Again, close call, but I had enough. I decided that I would tell my mum that I was late so that she would stop, (If she were to shoot a bullet at you and it barely missed, she's the type that would say \"it barely missed, stop whining\").  Friday. This morning. Woke up at 7:22am and woke my brothers up. Gulped down my breakfast, made my packed lunch AND prepared theirs this time. I was about to leave at 8:13am with them but guess what? My mum chimes in and says \"Don't walk off without your brothers. You tend to just speedwalk and make them unsafe\" - which NEVER happens. I speedwalk, yes, but I keep them safe too.  \"Noted. By the way, you made me late yesterday..I'd appreciate it if you don't make my journey to school a foot race with a car, thanks.\" \"Don't talk about what is in the past.\" \"Ok. Rephrase:  DON'T MAKE ME LATE AGAIN. \" I said this in a clear voice, but she snaps and yells \"are we in the future? So why are you complaining?? Stop complaining, dumbass!\"  I tell her what I'm saying is a precaution in a clear manner, similar to her precaution before, but she just goes into her native mode and screams her head off at me \"ARE YOU CHALLENGING ME?? DON'T MAKE ME BEAT YOU!\" I just turn and say, \"you don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Guess I'll leave\" and I stomped off with my brothers. Another super close call and  I was 15 seconds away from being late.  I never meant it like how she thought I would, but she just didn't give two s**ts about what I had to say. Tempers flared and I said the wrong words at the wrong time. I want to apologise for what I said accidentally, but before I do, I want my heart to be at peace and see whether I was the AH or not.\n",
      "My (25f) friend (25f) recently discovered gifs. She found this cute aesthetic one that she really liked and guess she wanted to have it physically.   I had mentioned this site/app a few months back that sends you so many free photo prints for the price of postage a month. Well, while on ft yesterday she was saying to me how this site was really good with the prints before, but this time they fckd up and wanted it fixed or was going to write a bad review.  I said to her that I think they do fix faults but I’m not 100% sure, just email them and explain what the problem is. She showed me the photo of the gif and I said it looks fine, what’s wrong with it? She replied that it’s not moving like what it’s suppose to. I couldn’t contain myself after that, I tried through tears to explain why it wouldn’t move. She became angry at me and hung up. She hasn’t spoken to me since then.   AITA for laughing?\n",
      "I (F25, Asian) have been with my fiance (M27, White) for over a year now. His mom has been overbearing since day one, for example the first time I met her she asked me if I am “pleasing her son enough sexually” and wanted to know how many times/week I am making him finish. She also always calls him sexy and asks him to touch his arms or abs (which he doesn’t think is weird) but that’s a story for a different day. i just want readers to understand the kinds of things she says out loud. She has lately (the past two months) been more hostile toward me whenever we are around her saying that I am “getting in the way of her relationship with her son” and that I need to “let him be alone with her more.” My fiance tells her that he wants to spend time with me when he’s not working so she can either see both of us or neither of us. This last time we saw her, we were eating dinner at her house with her new husband and my fiances brothers when out of nowhere she said “I hope your children look only like their dad.” This was out of nowhere but that’s how she always is. I said, “well we aren’t going to be having kids anytime soon so you don’t need to worry about that” to which she replied “well I don’t want biracial grandkids because they’re always so ugly when features are mixed together like that.” Everyone got quiet and I didn’t even know what to say. Eventually she got up and offered everyone dessert. Soon after we left and in the car I expressed to my fiance that I was hurt by what she said and the fact that he didn’t stand up for me. He said he didn’t want to hurt her feelings and that she didn’t mean it to be hurtful. I told him that if we do have children that she will never be able to see them or be around them because I don’t want our future kids to be around someone like that. He’s mad at me now and keeps telling me that I need to see things from her perspective and that it’s unfair that I would put him in a position like that by not letting her see our kids one day. I told him that it doesn’t really matter right now but that I will not budge on this when the time comes.\n",
      "I'll try to keep this short and to the point. My gf (23f) and I (23m) have been dating for about 6 months now and since the first few weeks she has messaged my twin brother. At first it only bothered me a little and I could handle it but as it has continued I've grown more uncomfortable with it. My brother and I have always had jealousy problems with each other which I think are amplified by us being twins. We have always been compared and it makes me feel very self conscious. We both get very possessive when it comes to girls that we like. My gf told me a month or two ago that she had a crush on my brother and she even showed me screenshots of her telling him that she liked him. This made me feel even worse. She doesn't try to hide anything from me concerning him, and always tells me that I can read their conversation history if I want, which I have done in the past but choose not to recently because it makes me feel shitty. She has never been very flirty with him and I trust that neither of them would do anything to hurt me but it still bothers me a lot, especially because I know that she does have feelings for him. I ignored how I felt for a while but eventually it came to a boiling point the other day and I confronted her about it. I told her that it makes me uncomfortable and insecure and asked that she stop talking to him. She told me that she wouldn't which hurt me even more because it feels to me like she cares more about maintaining a relationship with my brother than she cares about my feelings. She told me that me asking her to do that would invalidate her feelings and that it wasn't a problem because their relationship is purely Platonic and that he doesn't like her back anyways. She said that it would be like me asking her to stop talking to any of her friends and that it isn't fair for me to do that but I feel that its different because he's my brother. Since then she has continued to talk to him at the same rate. I know that if I asked my brother to block her he probably would, would that make me the bad guy? Am I the asshole in this situation?\n",
      "So, my dad is our condo's manager (administrator?). He's been voted for that position for the third time in a row so he must be good at it, but he's also kind of an odd guy as he's averse to technology and doesn't even own a phone. That means our intercom rings all day everyday with people wanting to talk to him. When he's not home, we (me, mom and sister) just ask them to call later or send him and e-mail.  There's this one lady, though, who just won't quit, she always wants to \"leave a message\" and she always has a list of complaints. After a couple times we learned to deal with her by telling her to refer to the book of complaints or leave her message with the doormen, or to e-mail my dad. Yesterday, though, she called and I just couldn't deal. It went like:  \"Hello, I want to speak to [the manager].\"  \"He went out, please try again later.\"  \"No, let me just say this. I went down to the common area and all the chairs have been moved\"  \"I don't know anything about it, ill tell my dad to call you back.\"  \"This is unacceptable, I have the right to go down with my son and have chairs to sit on, this hurts my rights to come and go, I had to skip therapy because there were no chairs by the playground, I --\"  \"LISTEN, lady, I have nothing to do with it. I don't work for the condo and Im not my dad's secretary, its not my job to listen or take note of your complaints. I will not pass on this message, so you'll need to write it down on the book LIKE WE'VE TOLD YOU A MILLION TIMES. Good day.\", and I slammed down the phone.  So the next day she'd emailed my dad AND written on the book that I'd been unnecessarily rude and uncivil to her. I'll admit that I was curt, I cut her off and I raised my voice. AITA?\n",
      "Alrighty reddit, I'll try and keep this as \"to the point\" as possible. I'm conflicted and hurt, and I've been through a lot with my family, and even though this sort of thing should be obvious to me it never really feels like it.  So as far as context, my aunt is an alcoholic. She helped raise me along with my mom, and she abused me constantly over the years. Nowadays both of them act like none of it ever happened and that I shouldn't be upset because it \"didn't happen every day.\" I unfortunately can't divulge too much info.  Eventually things deteriorated, and I started hating my Aunt so much that I ended up not really caring about what happened to her. I still cared enough about my mom to keep in contact with her. I always had trouble letting her go. Some days with her were just fine, like they used to be, while others were awful, and she constantly enabled her sister's drinking and subsequent behaviors, and even though she was likely a victim herself, she never took any responsibility for anything she did either.  Well, recently my Aunt made a few nasty remarks about my health condition during a FB call, and I decided that enough was enough. I'd been afraid of going N/C with them for a variety of reasons, like that they'd trash my stuff (I don't live in that city anymore and with COVID it's both too risky and pricy to return) or get rid of things I hadn't had time to ask for in the mail.. but I've had to swallow that pill and move ahead. I've endured a lot of mental strain over the years because of the abuse, and it felt like no matter how far away I was from them, it was never far enough. I decided over the next couple of days that I'd go N/C, but rather than tell my Aunt directly, I phoned my mom instead and tell her.  Long story short, didn't go well. Mom acted like the victim the whole time.  Here's where I think I was TA: During our conversation, towards the end, I outlined that nobody was to call, phone, or email me. When my mother asked what about her sister, I told her straight-up that the only contact I'll accept regarding her sister is letter letting me know when she's died. My mother called me awful and asked how I could say such a thing.  Honestly, I do feel terrible, like I've said the wrong thing even though that's how I really feel. This woman haunted me my whole life and continues to haunt me now, but I just know deep down that it was such a terrible thing to say and I shouldn't have said it. I feel like I've cursed myself or something, or done something so wrong. Was I TA??\n",
      "Okay so my(32F) mum(68F) and I, we care about each other a lot but at the same time we argue a lot. I feel like I need to be more patient with her as she’s getting on with age but she does drive me crazy all the time. Not to mention childhood issues she caused me with gaslighting, blame shifting etc. I have severe anxiety due to that but I’ve also already came to terms that she’s not doing it on purpose. This was what she grew up with and this is all she know but it doesn’t mean she’s causing harm on purpose.   She has an issue with respecting property. Since young, she would just claim my stuff saying that she bought them. I’ve sort of came to terms with that too and I don’t mind letting her have it but I wish she would stop claiming stuff and also ask before touching my things. I spoke to her about this before but it’ll only work for a few months at best then she will go back to her ways.  The latest incident which caused me to lose my temper was due to my friend hopping onto my online order. I’ve packed my friend’s stuff in a large bag and told her that all of that belonged to my friend. I even showed her what it was and told her if she wanted it, I can order it for her the next time I order again. She didn’t want it. Today, I woke up and walked out of the room to find that the bag of things belonging to my friend has been rummaged through. Some items were on her desk, some on a chair nearby and some were switched with similar(but brand new) items we already have. My mum wasn’t home. So I called her and asked her why the hell did she touch my things. She insisted she didn’t touch anything then I told her what exactly she touched. She said she thought I bought it for the family and the switching was because she took it out and didn’t bother to check what she took and just replaced it with our own. I told her why would I bother to pack something I bought for the family in a bag and that I already told her yesterday it belonged to my friend. I asked her again if she wanted it, and that I will buy it for her. She rejected it then asked me why can’t I just give her one from what my friend ordered. If those items really belonged to me, I don’t mind if she takes anything but it doesn’t.   I feel like an asshole for losing my temper and yelling at her especially with her age and blood pressure but for some reason, she just drives me up the wall. Each time I try to explain things to her, she would insist on her own ways till I lose my temper then she would say I’m always losing my temper at her. Every time I lose my temper, I feel so guilty. Am I the asshole?  TLDR My mum doesn’t respect my things and I feel like an asshole for losing my temper.\n",
      "Throwaway account, first time poster, on mobile (srry abt formatting)  My mom and I have a somewhat rocky relationship. She comes off as immature sometimes so I don't really confide in her. Since I was younger, she would constantly snoop on me and my younger sister's social media accounts (Note: my sis and I are both minors) and when I found out, I changed all my passwords and put a lock on my phone to keep my privacy. My sis never got the chance to do this and now, my mom is basically the one using her acc, especially her FB. She's the one sending messages, reading her chats, posting on her status. She even controls what my sis can and can't send to her chats. She also managed my sis' IG for some time until she had to delete the app from her phone due to storage space. My sis isn't the confrontational type so she never spoke up about this. This became a bigger problem when my sis started playing an online mobile game with her friends through my mom's phone since she didn't have space on hers. My mom could see the chat where they discuss what time they'll play, their team, etc. In this chat, she would agree to play with them without my sis' permission and accept game invites even if my sis didn't want to play. My sis would end up crying sometimes because of how frustrated she is since she's being forced to play.  I eventually confided in one of my close friends (who my sister also plays the game with) about my mom using my sis' account. I also told him that I argue with her a lot about it and that she usually manages to shift the blame and play victim. He handled it well and promised not to tell anyone. Idk how but my mom found out and berated me for telling him, saying that I'm giving our family a bad name and that personal problems must stay within the family. In my defense, I really couldn't argue with her anymore since she's so stubborn and I know she'll just overreact and play the victim card again. And plus, I'm very careful about who I let into my life since I have terrible trust issues and barely anyone knows about my personal life (kinda funny since I'm telling strangers on the internet about this but oh well).  Until now, she's still using my sis' acc 90% of the time. My sis has been standing up for herself lately. My mom would make remarks about how she's becoming like me (that is, selfish and disrespectful, apparently). For some reason she finds entertainment in my sis' chats, even though she isn't the intended audience. Personally, I think her behavior is weird, childish and borderline manipulative. Ironically, the friend that I confided in became my mom's favorite person to talk to, which makes me a bit salty and uncomfortable tbh.   I think I'm not TA for confronting her about using my sis' acc but idk if it was right to tell my friend about it. It's been months already but I still feel kinda guilty cuz I did involve another person in my personal problems instead of dealing with it myself. AITA for telling my friend about it?\n",
      "For some context, I have severe social anxiety. So maybe ITA and I just need a reality check…  I first met my sister’s friend (J) when they were both friends with my (now-ex) bf ~8 yrs ago. They all belonged to a social circle that had a lot of parties, many at J's house. I made a few efforts to go to the parties, but after feeling out of place a few times I stopped going (but I always encouraged my ex to go.) However, my ex and my sis both told me that J would always ask where I was and why I wouldn’t come to parties with him. I was surprised, because she never seemed particularly interested to talk to me before. Once after hearing this, I went and made an effort to talk to her, but she seemed not only uninterested but not especially friendly.  So it surprised me that she continued to ask him why I didn’t go to parties after that…it made them feel pressured because she would bring this up around other people, and he eventually told all his friends that I had social anxiety. I was embarrassed, but understood he had to make some kind of explanation for me. Nevertheless, she continued to bring up my absence at these parties, and it clearly embarrassed them to have to make excuses for me to their friends.  Sure, people ask about how their friends SO’s and siblings are from time to time. But rarely ever do they make such an issue of it that it has to be brought to the attention of the person in question, right? Over and over, even after knowing they have a mental illness? I kinda doubt any of my bf’s or sister’s friends cared that I didn’t go to social gatherings, until this girl brought it up as a topic of conversation among them, apparently with such emphasis that my ex and sister were encouraging me to go out with them just because this girl wouldn’t let it go?  A couple years ago my sister invited J and her husband to a dinner with my family. I tried to be welcoming to her, but when I talked to her, she and her husband exchanged very pointed looks at each other as though they were in on a private joke. They looked at me like I was this freak they were tolerating, even as they were guests in my family’s home. After this, I told my sis I thought J was fake and clearly enjoyed talking about me more than actually talking to me, and I didn't want to have anything to do with her.  So on father’s day, my fam had planned a BBQ at the park. I was helping get packed up to go, and just as we were leaving my sister said that J and her husband were coming. I wanted to help my family get set up and to spend the day with my Dad, but I was really surprised and emotionally triggered. The last thing I wanted was to cause drama and make the day about me, but I ended up crying and couldn’t make myself stop. I went to the park and set up, then left just as J and her husband arrived. It was so awkward, and I just went home as my family celebrated without me. Everyone things I’m crazy for not wanting to hang out with this girl. Am I?\n",
      "So this happened 20 minutes ago. I asked my SO to head over to a dollar general to grab some beer as I was making dinner. This is a 5 minute trip and is one we do enough for me to know she shouldn’t be gone longer than 10.   30 minutes passes by and I notice her she didn’t bring her phone so I start to get worried so I hault dinner and get in the car to go look for her and make sure nothing bad happened.   I go to the dollar general and she is no where to be found, I leave and head towards another store that is a good 10 minutes away and pass her on her way back. I turn around and we meet in the driveway and I raised my voice at her. I can admit I could’ve not raised my voice but I was genuinely concerned. Turns out she went to the store that was farther away and realized she didn’t have her phone. Was I the asshole for raising my voice at her??\n",
      "I have been sick for 5 days now. I feel a lot better but not great. My father told me we were all going out to eat. I told him I didn't feel like going out but I'd be okay hanging out with him inside the house. He told me that if I don't go out with him and my mom l'm not allowed to see my bestfriend/boyfriend for another week. We argued when I told him that threatening to take away something that makes me happy doesn't make me want to be around him. After he left the house in a rage I told my mom \"This is why Chad (his son) doesn't want to visit him.\" She said it was mean of me to say  but I simply spoke the truth. I didn't even say it to him. Plus, threatening my happiness is what's mean. So am I the asshole?\n",
      "I'm 13F if that matters. My mom takes me and my younger brother (9) to visit our uncle every weekend. He can't walk well anymore because of a neurological illness and I feel sorry for him. But he's also become a really difficult person. He used to love me and my brother visiting but now we're scared of doing anything around the house because he could yell at us. He basically freaks out if we just move a chair in the dining room. Our mom helps him and his roommate with chores but he just cries or lashes out at them. The whole weekend is the three of them fighting over stupid things and my brother and I have to go distract ourselves somewhere else.  WIBTA if I told my mom me and my brother prefer to stay at home when she visits our uncle? Thanks.\n",
      "So I (21F) am planning to spend NYE at my best friend's (21F) place. I intend to stay overnight and come home at around 10AM the next morning. I want to spend NYE at my best friend's home because I am pretty sure the party will be excellent. I attended last year and had a great time, and I have no doubt hanging out with her and her family and their friends will be way more fun than sitting in my room playing on my phone through the countdown.   Along with my parents and brother, I also live with my grandmother (75F). I informed my grandmother of my NYE plans today, and she got really upset at me, telling me that I shouldn't be staying overnight at someone else's home - specifically because I am a girl. She has quite traditional beliefs and generally doesn't approve of women staying out late, let alone staying overnight at someone else's home for 'unnecessary reasons' - just for context, my mother is  48  and my grandma has nagged her for coming home at 11.30PM on a weekend before, so that's where we stand.   She has gone on to pressure my parents to stop me from going. Now my dad is in turn also pressuring me not to go, mostly because he doesn't want to deal with my grandma nagging him. My mum has no problem with me going, but she would prefer if I not stay out too late the next few days after NYE just to appease my grandma, which I was planning on doing anyway.   My best friend is well acquainted with my family. She has come over to my place several times and spoken with my parents and my grandma. I have stayed over at her place before. My parents are not worried about me being unsafe in her home. I live in a very safe country, and from the time I reach my best friend's home I would be spending all my time in the house, surrounded by adults of which include my best friend's parents, who my parents have met and trust, and who I also spent NYE with last year. And importantly to me, my brother (15M) has spent nights over at his friend's homes, and my grandma has never had a problem with it. This is absolutely not purely a general safety issue.   My family does not do anything special for NYE. Even if I stay home, my grandma and my parents will be in bed by 11 and I will not be missing out on family time. I intend on staying overnight rather than leaving after the countdown because the party will probably continue until at least 1AM, and I don't have a reliable mode of transport back home after that (public transport won't be running, I don't drive, and I'm not really keen on dropping $40 on a cab at surcharge rates), and I just want to enjoy a sleepover with my best friend after celebrating the arrival of the new year.   So WIBTA for sticking with my plans and spending NYE at my best friend's place anyway?\n",
      "I'm 15 and have a 16 year old sister, don't get me wrong shes a wonderful sister and a best friend but what pissed me off is when she copies me and steals my stuff without consent, I don't know if I'm exaggerating.  I told her how I loved polar bears and shared their facts, 1 week later I saw her post on instagram claiming she loves polar bears while wearing MY polar bear onesie, I brushed it off because she probably loves them as much as I do, I told her about it and she acted weird but I was naive so I wasn't bothered.  A few weeks came by and showed my sister what I bought, it was a really pretty sterling silver necklace with a heart chain that was around 14 dollars. 4 days later I was going to the park with some of my friends and got ready,  I was looking for my necklace and it was gone, I was confused but it didn't bothered me since I'll buy another one since it's fairly cheap, when I came home I saw my sister taking pictures with MY exact necklace, I was mad but bottled it up, I came over to her and asked where she got that necklace and she looked shocked and told me she was just borrowing it and again I was naive and brushed it off but I was still quite mad.  A few weeks after, I showed her a head bandana I was gonna order and how excited I was wearing it with an outfit she bought for my birthday, she was excited as I was since I planned to wear it for our family event. I wore the outfit and planned to go with my sister but she went without me, so me and my mom drove there, as soon as my auntie saw me she questioned if I was matching with my sister, I was confuse and asked what she was talking about and she said my sister has the exact same outfit and head bandana but the opposite color as I do, I quickly went inside and dragged my sister outside and asked what the hell is she doing and why does she kept on copying and stealing my stuff, she told me it was  normal  for siblings to do that and I should get used to it, basically switched the subject to how CUTE we looked matching, I basically lashed out at her telling & calling her to fuck off,a thief, a bitch who has no style and needs to copy someone else,etc.. my auntie and my mom just stood there disbelief without saying a word, I walked away and called my friend to pick me up, a few hours later I got a call from my mom telling me I shouldn't have said that to my sister and how awful I was basically, I do feel bad and of course I got the beating but I really wonder.. am I the asshole?  PS: (my sister copying me has happened so many times I just didn't added them since I bottle my anger up and the only first and last time I finally lost my cool)\n",
      "My wife and I are expecting our first child. It's a girl and we are excited. However, we are locked in a stalemate when it comes to names. We went through many and I thought we settled on one, but then my wife revealed she really wanted to name our daughter after her grandmother. I never met her grandmother as she died long before I met my wife. I asked what her grandmother's name was and she told me...  I immediately said no.  Her name is extremely uncommon and honestly, terrible. It's a biblical name, but think less \"Deborah\" and more \"Colossians.\" She explained that the name is important to her because she was very close to her grandmother and that she had always dreamed of naming her future child after her. I understand where she's coming from, but a name like that would attract all types of ridicule. Not to mention discrimination in terms of employment.  My wife said she didn't care and that lots of people with unusual names have successful lives. I told her while that is true, they tend to have a significantly harder time than most. That's when she started going off on me and pointed out that she always goes along with things I like even if she disagrees with it. I replied saying that was her own fault as she should've spoken up because I wouldn't have made any decisions that she disagreed with.  I offered a compromise saying that we could use it as a middle name instead. But nope, it's first name or nothing.\n",
      "My friends dog passed away and she has been extremely upset the past few weeks. I invited her to come over for a girls night and drink wine + order take away. Living with my (22M) partner in a one bedroom apartment I asked him if he wanted to join us or go hang out at a friends that night. He told me he didn’t want to intrude, so decided he will go camping with his best friend (Matt), Matt’s GF, the dog and a few other boys from work. I told him he didn’t have to leave for the whole weekend and he was more than welcome to stay and he insisted he would go.   Fast forward to Saturday night, my friend came over and we drank a lot of wine. I texted my boyfriend at 9pm saying goodnight and he did not reply so he was asleep. My old school friend Sarah (Matt’s younger sister) came over a bit later on and we were also drinking. She then asked if we wanted to go to her brothers house and drink there as it was a bigger house and we could play music without disturbing the neighbours.  We all agreed to share an Uber ride there and to my surprise Matt’s friends were all there. (This is my partners friend circle they are all his best friends). I then gathered that Matt had let his friends stay while he was camping with my boyfriend.  Thinking nothing of it, we were drinking laughing and just having fun. We were not partying or dancing just hanging out. I did not cheat on him and his friends know me and him are together.   Sarah said to me “you can stay here and sleep with me in my brothers bed if you like, I’m gonna go to bed now but you’re more than welcome to stay”. I said that I will probably catch an Uber later but will stay up a little longer.  Next thing I knew it was 5am, I got very carried away in conversations with my boyfriends friends we were talking about everything in life. I then got a text from my partner at 5:30 saying that he is coming home to talk.  When I got home I passed out from that big night and woke up in the afternoon to my partner coming home. He dumped me, told me I make him sick and that it was sneaky of me to do that behind his back. I was so shocked and hurt at the things he was saying.  AITA for not texting my boyfriend beforehand? I didnt think it was a big deal as they are his friends? He’s packing his stuff as I post this now and I haven’t stopped crying. I can’t seem to figure out what I’ve done wrong. I’m not a party animal nor do I do this every weekend. My partner was away and the girls and I drank together then went to her brothers house.\n",
      "I'm a grad student in a class with mixed grad/undergrad students. We sit at lab-type tables in small groups. One kid showed up like 30 minutes late to class today and sat at my table because the table he normally sat at was full. I already didn't care for this guy because it's a small class he's generally late/rude/doesn't pay attention. Anyway, I'm working on an activity with the rest of the table and he's trying to get the teacher's attention. He calls him Mr. rather than Dr. and I don't know if I was just in a bad mood or what but I looked at him and said \"Hey, man, he has a doctorate. So maybe you should use Dr. instead of Mr.\" My reasoning is that we're in college and it's common knowledge that most professors have doctorates in their field and we should address them as such. Also, it's nearly the end of the semester. He should know better.   AITA?  Edit: Many people have pointed out that it is common to call professors by anything other than doctor. I have never heard any of my classmates address any of the professors in our department anything other than Dr. And we're very informal with each other otherwise.\n",
      "On a throwaway (and obligatory mobile, grammar apologies, etc)   Nibling - (niece/nephew) trying to be as vague as possible.   For context, I live a fair distance from the rest of my family, so rarely spend THIS MUCH time with them. I’m often accused of being snobby/snooty and generally a “pain” (their words)   So, this year to keep the peace, I just kept my head down and spent most of the time on my phone, passively going through the holiday, obviously speaking and interacting with my family, minor decisions (normally ones that start arguments) I have stayed away from.   Cut to today, having spent the afternoon shopping, we arrive back. Nibling is in trouble (due to an earlier incident) and has been sent to their room.   We all decide to watch a comedy special, as nibling was being punished and is in room (away from strong language) Stepfather is not a fan of what we decide on (wasn’t in the room) and leave the room only to return with nibling so they “can have a snack” (nibling is old enough to speak on their behalf) so now it’s inappropriate.  I have pointed out this was intentional (because he didn’t want to watch) only for sibling (and parent of nibling) to accuse (scream at) me of letting their child starve, even though they want for nothing and are old enough to ask for food AND are being punished. Everyone else has just told me to shut up and has accused me of being selfish (because we had ALL agreed to watch it, apart from stepfather) and I had said the action was intentional. Stepfather has now slunk off as if nothing had happened.   This is a regular thing and as usual had the family pile on me, so I just need to ask AITA?\n",
      "so roughly 6 months ago I (19F) was about to go on a trip with my bf and his family. one day I was in school waiting in line for my lunch with a group of friends. one of them (18F) asked me about the trip. she asked \"why are you going again, are you visiting my paps family?\" and before I was able to answer she continued to say \"isn't he like dead or something?\" and started laughing. I froze for a second in shock (he died 4 years prior and me and this friend have been friends for roughly 9 or 10 years). I was so furious i almost couldnt think stright, fortunately I was able to keep my cool and said to her \"-friends name- you can't just sat that!\" and she had audacity to reply while still laughing with \"I'm sorry I'm emotionless haha\" after that I stop talking to her for 2 months bc I took his death very hard and she knew that. finally she found out that I was upset and apologized. I on the other hand am still upset bc she beyond crossed the only line I have that you shouldn't cross. so should I get over it since she apologized or do I still have very right to be upset with her?\n",
      "Background. SO(36m) and I(24f) have been together for 5yrs. I've been a licensed stylist for 3 years. I have been his hairstylist since I started cos school 4 years ago.   I'd say in the last 8-4 months (because he honestly gets 3-4 haircuts a year from me) I've noticed thinning/receeding in his widow's peak. Not much anywhere else. This spot that's thinning is about 2\" round right in the middle of his hairline.  The hair on his temples is thinner but that's normal from what I see as a hairstylist.  I causally brought up PRP as we were relaxing and entertaining. I have not brought it up since then.   His answer was flat out NO.   Before I even explained what PRP is, he straight up said no. & As I said, we were entertaining so I didn't bring it up again. *this is something that would comfortably come up in front of our guest (his buddy of 25+ years). We discuss all types of embarrassing & typically off limit topics in our close circle.   So my question for you guys is... WIBTA I bring it up again?   If you don't know what PRP for hair loss is, bottom line is they draw your blood out of your arm, spin it and separate your red blood cells, plasma, and whatever else is in blood. They then take only the plasma, the Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), and inject it into your scalp directly (the area you're treating for hair loss).   WIBTA if I mention it again? I believe it to be safe. I can add the links to the medical spa I've researched. I can show before & after photos from the doctor I'd likely request he go with. I told him before that I would cover all costs.\n",
      "My wife (F36) and I (M39) are expecting our firstborn. Last week, my mother told us that she wanted to organize a baby-shower. She even had already decided a date (first red flag).  Last week my mother told us she wanted to organize the baby-shower and already had a place, what ornaments she would buy and even had picked a date. When we tried to check if we were available, she told us that it had be that date, as it was the only date my mom’s best friend could assist.  My mother already had a short list which included my sister and her fiancée, my father’s family, and her friend with her partner. But not any of our friends, nor any of my wife’s family, not even her mother (MiL). As calmly as I could I explained that we appreciated the offer but that we wanted different things for the baby-shower and to include both families and our friends.   My mother’s mood changed as soon as we spoke, and was no longer speaking about organizing it. We told her that we would take the planning of the party and appreciated any help.  We started looking for venues and my MiL got an offer of a big party room at a fraction of the price with tables, an equipped kitchen w/fridge and restroom facilities.  I called my mother telling the news. She said that we were wasting money in throwing a party when we should be saving it for the baby. This took me off balance as we were not asking her any money and the cost of venue was very cheap. We were also saving as my wife’s family offered to make food and friends were helping with the decoration.  I told her that we had few other options, as if we invited my father’s side of the family, it was just as fair that we should invite my other relatives, as well as my wife’s family and our friends. I reminder her that she wanted to invite even relatives that my wife did not got along with.   My mom told that she did not understood why we wanted a big celebration and that we did not had to invite everyone. She continued berating and said she only wanted to do a baby-shower “for the family” so the pregnancy did not went “unnoticed”.  That was where I snapped. I told her that the baby-shower should be planned for “my wife and the baby” not “for the family”. She said I was overreacting. I responded that I found surprising that I had to explain her why it was wrong to plan a baby-shower where none of my wife friends or even her mother was invited. At that point my mother hang as “I was being unreasonable”.  My father and sister both are on my mom’s side as “I was ungrateful” and instead did “what I wanted”. Of course my mom do not want to have anything to do with this new party (hopefully she might cool down otherwise she might not come at all). I feel guilty for snapping at my mother but also felt that she was rebuking our decision of spending on a party for my wife of taking her offer of “her” party. AITA?\n",
      "I (15f) am an amateur artist. I usually sketch portraits of actors and fictional characters. 3 years ago, my Father demanded me to sketch him. It was nowhere near an ask, he basically said, \"Sketch me, if you're that good an artist.\"   I was offended but I after hours of trying to find the right photo out of the ones he had selected, I began the gruelling process of making his sketch to maintain peace in the house.  This was my first sketch of a person who wasn't a perfectly carved model with their photo being a selfie rather than from a professional photoshoot with good lighting.  After I started it, everytime he would see me taking a break or not sketching and doing anything else, he would throw taunts at me.  He used to refer to it as my \"most important assignment\".   It grew to the point where he would publicly humiliate me by saying stuff like \"She said she could sketch me, but apparently 'artists' take their sweet time. They have to 'get in the mood' and 'have the right mindset' to complete their assigned work\"  I'd had it with him and I stopped the sketch right away. He continued the taunts anyway anytime he saw a chance, which made me stop sketching anything at all for about 2 whole years.   With the quarantine going on, I recently regained the confidence to finally make art again without minding what they might say. I even started another sketch of him without telling him. However, there had already been so much tension and fights regarding the artwork that working on it only stressed me out leading to me dropping it yet again.  And let's just say I don't have the best relationship with my father to be able to look at him for so long with such concentration.  I'm not a professional. Hell, I even shy away from calling myself an artist to this date because of all he said about me. I do need to have a pure connection with the person I am sketching with no negative feelings regarding them or else it just falls apart and I can't make it. Also, that's not all I do. Just like any human being, I have to want to do it to be able to do it.  The other day, my Mother came at me yet again while I was sketching, \"All this hardwork for these strangers yet you loathe your Father the most, don't you?\"  Man, did I wanna say yes, but I didn't. I didn't stop either. I simply moved to the study room where she wouldn't disturb me as much. I've lost years of experience because of these hateful comments, not doing it again.  Am I being the asshole?\n",
      "Backstory... I have been a dementia specialist caregiver for many many yrs. My MIL is a real jerk to me and anything I do finds something to be angry and hysterical at me for. My husband defends me and yells so then we all never speak. Her family says I always need to apologize because she is starting to get dementia like her mother. Well, she is a full blown alcoholic. These things she usually mutates in her mind because she's drunk. Like doesn't even make sense. She's forgetful because she gets super drunk everyday. I have apologized for huge things I have never done like 8X. I apologized for her out of nowhere drunkenly yelling at me crazily and pushing me wanting to fight and calling me a piece of sh#t. At this point my husband and I are done catering to an alcoholic and an enabling family who will never stand up to her even though they know she's wrong. AITA? I mean, she could have the beginning signs of dementia but she is completely coherent, just a little forgetful about ever going to a few restaurants and a few things that happened YEARS ago, ect. I mean, I forget things like that too sometimes. So does my mom too (her same age.) Her mother was a jerk to women too so since she's a jerk to me and sometimes her actual daughter all of a sudden it's dementia and I'm supposed to feel bad and cater to her. I don't see dementia with my many trained yrs of expertise… I see alcoholism and excuses and enabling.\n",
      "Tl;dr: my twin put their dirty sheets in my room and I though they were clean so I put them on my bed, and then my mom found out and made us both help me clean my bed. Twin got super pissed and blamed me for making a mistake  I (14f) and my twin sibling “Liam” (also 14 lol) were doing laundry the other day. I always put my clean sheets on my chair, and Liam decided to put their dirty sheets on my chair, even though they have their own room. I accidentally put the dirty sheets on my bed thinking that they were clean sheets that I just didn’t remember putting there. I have adhd and don’t remember a lot of the things that I do so that would be pretty normal for me.   Liam came into my room whilst I was putting on the sheets and didn’t say anything. A few hours after, Liam told me that I had put the wrong sheets on my bed, but I was playing Minecraft at that point and felt like being lazy, so I just shrugged and continued playing. The next day my mom realized that we had only put one set of sheets in the washer and she asked about it, so I told her, and she made both of us put new sheets on my bed because it was equally our faults. Liam just stood in the doorway and talked about how it was unfair that our mom made them help, and we got into an argument. Liam ran away into the kitchen, which they do a lot whenever they feel like they should get the last word in the middle of an argument.  Our mom happened to be walking in the hallway and made Liam go back up to my room and help out, but all Liam did was whisper to me about how I was in the wrong and how it was all my fault and how “mom always takes your side”. I kind of feel bad for telling our mom about Liam’s mistake, but I also think that Liam overreacted. Like, is it that hard to just admit that you were in the wrong and help me?   So, AITA?\n",
      "I was adopted as a baby. Although I know my biological parents' identities, I've never reached out to them because they've made it clear that they don't want me in their lives. Naturally, I'm still very curious about what they're like, and I want to talk to them even if they don't know who I am. One of them is very active on an anonymous website (using usernames rather than real names), and I've been considering striking up a casual conversation about some mundane topic with that parent without revealing that I'm their biological child. I wouldn't get into anything too personal (like the circumstances of my birth) unless they brought it up first.  I'm conflicted on whether or not that would be too invasive and deceptive. On the one hand, I would sort of be violating their wish for no contact and hiding information from them, but on the other hand, they wouldn't even know about it.\n",
      "Info about me: I’m 20 F, I live with my parents (50s) and my siblings (17M and 17F).   The issue: Earlier today I was eating dinner in the kitchen/dining area of our house; my parents and my brother were also in there but they weren’t eating. Recently our house has been having some plumbing issues, so my mom was talking to my dad about that and discussing whether they should call a plumber. My dad travels for work sometimes and he hasn’t been home for the past week so my mom was describing the plumbing issues to him in (too much) detail. Like describing clogged toilets and stuff.   I told my mom “can you stop talking about this right now, at least wait until I’m done eating.” So then my mom got sort of annoyed and said that I’m being too sensitive, and that my brother isn’t complaining, and my dad agreed with her. Also, this isn’t the first time that my mom has talked about gross stuff (like things that are toilet related, illnesses/being sick, injuries) while I was eating, and this isn’t the first time I’ve complained about it. She’s had similar responses the other times too (that I’m too sensitive and I’m the only one who complains about this).   Then they started talking about toilet stuff again and I thought there was no point in arguing further, so I went to eat in a different room. Later when I came back to the kitchen to put my plate away my mom was still in there and she said I was being too dramatic by leaving the room (what else was I supposed to do??). I’ll admit I am kind of sensitive to disgusting stuff, at least more than the rest of my family. But I don’t think it’s unreasonable that I don’t want to hear that while I’m eating.\n",
      "So basically, my brother spends most of his time being a dick to me, Basically unlocks my door, takes my laptop, starts showing me stupid shit, sings shitty rap songs, plays his shitty music, throws stuff into my room, plays with the lights and attempts to read my messages on various social media sites, if I tell him to leave me alone, my parents yell at me because I need to be \"inclusive\" and apparently I need to be \"kind to my family\". I have bad anxiety (which my family refuses to believe) and my room is the only place I had left until a few days ago when my brother figured out how to unlock my door. I just don't understand my parents inability to comprehend me not being at fault.  Edit: I'm a middle child and he's 15\n",
      "My (21F) mom (43F) has put on 35 pounds in the last 6 months. She is addicted to her phone and once she starts scrolling she can continue for 2-3 hours while sitting down.  She had always been very active and was obsessed with doing all the house chores herself even though we offered to help out(She is SAHM). Now, she sits majority of the time and does so not even leave the house (which might have led to her weight gain).  Her family has a history of diabetes and as per our doctor she needs to lose atleast 20 pounds and start exercising to avoid any future health complications. We have tried to motivate her to atleast start leaving the house as we believe she can lose weight if her lifestyle improves. She however makes excuses and continues scrolling.  In the past 1 week me and my brother tried tricking her to reduce scrolling. We would make very small (but unnecessary requests) like asking for a glass of water or requesting her to make snacks at home etc. which she agreed. She still did not leave our home but she was more active.  Today she got a hint of what we are upto and refused to cater to any of our requests and confronted me if I was making the requests on purpose when I can actually do it myself. I said yes as she needs to stay active and she got so mad at me and told me she is an adult who can care for herself and I crossed a line here.  AITA?  Edit: To clarify asking for water or snacks is something I was doing for the past week to get her distracted. If this was normal behavior she would not have caught on to it or questioned me over it. I am perfectly capable of getting my own water/snacks. The question here is was my tricking her wrong?  Edit: I agree with most of the comments that there is something deeper here and my mom needs to see a therapist. I agree tricking her was an AH move.   All the people calling out \"fat phobia\" my mom was already 183-185 pounds and now she is 220. When doctor advices someone to lose weight (if he is a sensible doc) it's because it is actually needed and not for cosmetic purposes. Please normalize taking care of yourself without calling it \"fat phobia\".\n",
      "This was 5 years ago when I was 24   I was moved out of my parents house for like 2 years and I was saving money to move to buy a new apartment,remind you I was saving that money for 2 years,my younger brother lived at my parents house he would occasionally come to visit me  I told my brother that I was going to vacation and that I wont be home for like 1 week or so (I was finally given free time so I wanted to use it)and I know this was wrong of me to do but I trusted my brother back then I gave him the keys of the apartment so if anybody wants to steal something or money they would get caught I wanted to make sure nothing stole the money I was saving,and the keys were to my apartment and also to unlock the money   After I came back home from my good vacation I found out my brother also moved out of my parents house,I was happy for him because he would normally talk about how he wants to move out of my parents house and wants to be free from my parents pressure,I was so happy I called him and I told him how happy I was for him and how he is able to stand on his own. He seemed nervous I didnt pay much attention because I thought he was nervous because of the new life he would have now,looking back I trusted my brother so much that I didnt even check if the money were there. Turns out the money aren't there anymore I was scared and immediately called my brother that to tell me if he knows of this or I should contact the police,and the thing was he stole the money and told me \"please understand,dont be mad at me for some money I want to be happy and feel happy about myself\"i immediately shut the phone down ,went to my parents house and told them what my brother was doing and ask them should I contact the police or not and suprise suprise turns out they know all of this. They told me that I shouldn't keep money away from family and that it was wrong of me to call the police,I was beyond angry and told them many things(which I regret) I cut off contact off my brother and I sometimes talk to my parents and they neg me and call me childish for letting money ruin our relationship I haven't spoken to him or answered his calls in 5 years  AITA?\n",
      "I don't have any friends so I sit by myself in the cafeteria, and I see my classmate walk towards my table. He was talking with his friends at his table, and he was laughing on the way to my table. He said, \"How's your day friend?\" It felt fake because we have never talked to each other before and it felt like he was just trying to be friends with me as a joke, like \"haha I'm being friends with this random lonely guy I don't know.\" I said, \"please just go\" and put my earbuds in, ignoring him. He said, \"that boy is rude\" to his friends in what seemed like a joking manner. So AITA?\n",
      "It was a typical day, I was just going for a jog around my neighborhood, and I ended up jogging all the way from the trail in the woods which ended up to a convenience store. I was feeling really thirsty, so I was planning on going into the convenience store to grab an energy drink and going back to jogging. Right next to the door of the store, there was a bench. There was a scruffy man with greasy hair as well as dirty clothes who was sitting on the bench resting. Before I could even open the door, the man immediately started talking to me, asking me if I could spare any change, and that all he needed was 50 dollars.  I actually had enough to give to him, so I agreed. I handed him the 50 dollars and instead of looking grateful, he looked a bit angry expecting more, he didn't even say, 'thank you'. I started walking in the store and I could see through the window of the convenience store that he was staring at me. I paid for my energy drink which left me with 60 dollars, which I was going to use to uber home, despite my prior plans of continuing jogging, I was starting to feel a bit sick.  When I walked out of the store, I was immediately berated by the homeless man, he started asking if I could he could have more money, so he could support his son. I really felt tempted to give him more, but I told him I needed it for a ride back home. The man started beckoning me, saying how that I am failing to support his family, which is an asshole thing to do. I nervously told him that I already helped him, and that I really needed the money.  Instead of respecting what I said, he immediately started yelling at me, and swearing me out, making such a big scene that even the customers inside the store and the cashier looked out the window. I was in awe, but I snapped when the man started reaching for my wallet in my pocket. I immediately told him to fuck off, and that I would call the police. He then started making threatening gestures to me. I started getting a bit scared for my safety at this point, so I started to jog away and I called an Uber and went home.  TL;DR I feel like I shouldn't have acted that aggressive to the man, but I feel like it was somewhat justified.\n",
      "I (22M) graduated from college last week and recently got a job in the Seattle area. This will require me to move 2500 miles from the Southeast. My mother has decided that she wanted to go on this 5/6 day road trip with me and I do not like this idea.   For starters, I drive a Miata so it is by no means a great car to roadtrip in to start with. Add on the fact that my mother is overweight, has bad joints, and hates riding in my car as is, I don’t think it would be good for her health to sit in that small car for days on end. On top of that, me and her have completely different tastes in music, food, and entertainment, so finding things along the way to enjoy will be hard.   I have asked her multiple times to let me do this road-trip alone but she starts with the waterworks and says she feels like I am abandoning her like my brother did (that’s a whole other story). I feel like she’s either manipulating me or just not ready to accept the fact that I am a grown man who is ready to go off on his own. My father and sister have both said that I should let her go with me on my road trip but I feel as if that’s easy for them to say because 1: they’re not going to be the ones stuck in a car for 5 days with her and 2: it would stop her emotional tantrums about the subject.  So… with all this being said, AITA?\n",
      "I’ll keep this brief. But first a small explanation: I am looking for a job and have been looking for a job for months so I can help my family but they are super overprotective and won’t just ‘let me work anywhere with all kinds of people.’.My hands are tied because even though I want to work and help ,they have all these terms and conditions about what place of work is appropriate for a girl that I am losing hope I’ll find anything they approve of.  My mom doesn’t work nor has any desire to do so even though we are not in our best financial situation. Today we needed to buy groceries but my dad (who’s the only breadwinner in a house of 5 adults ) had left no money for groceries. So my mom comes  at me and asks me to loan her 20 dollars so we could buy groceries.I give it to her ask if she could tell her cousin (who does her groceries for us since she’s ToO TiReD AlL THe TiMe) to buy me something for breakfast. She tells me no, there are not enough money. Okay.I understand and leave it at that. After 20 minutes I go in the kitchen, she had apparently not heard me come in and I hear her talking to her cousin about some missing packs of cigarettes. They resolve it on the phone and I ask her about it when she finally hangs up,she tells me  she had told him to buy not one,not two BUT THREE packs of cigarettes for her. So I say ‘We had money for three packs of cigarettes but not for a croissant for me ?’. She tells me to straight up to ‘fuck off’. This kind of dismissive short and rude response got me heated , I waited until my dad came home told him all about it and basically had a huge argument with her about how she should start working if she wants to afford 3-4 packs of cigarettes a day and the maid my dad pays so she can sit on her ass all day and essentially do NOTHING. It didn’t end up well and now everybody is against her.  Now she’s telling me how I’m a coward and a backstabber for involving everyone in it just for a ‘fucking croissant’. To me it’s about the the fact that she’s waisting groceries money on her expensive addiction.  AITA?\n",
      "at the beginning of 2019 my mom found a new boyfriend at church she attends they went on a few dates and they loved spending time and I really didn’t care At first in November he moved in our house .  But he would interpret my prayers I practice the Muslim faith so my prayers are really important to me and I was annoyed at the fact that he would do that  then he wanted me go too church with him I shot that down.  I rolled mom that he needs to stop interrupting me while I do my prayers  she said he’s just in interested in your prayers I was mad but just  Went to my room Angry the next day he did it agin I told him to get out please so I could have some Peace After I was done with my pray I felt bad and I say Sorry to him but my Faith is very important to me\n",
      "I'm willing to admit that I am a homebody who doesnt like entertaining people so I have very few (very low matenience) friends. People I grew up with who dont mind that I only reach out once every few weeks or so and never hold it against me when I simply dont want to hang out.  I'm happy with my life. I have told him this time and time again. In the beginning my boyfriend loved this about me. Mainly because he had some insecurities and he loved the fact that where I didnt go out partying or spending my time on social media, he didnt have to worry. He quickly got over those insecurities because I never did anything.   However, back about 2 months ago (4 years in) he started attempting to push his hobbies off onto me. He wanted me to get out more and make friends and \"see the world\". At first he started bringing home things that he knew I would enjoy. I'm very crafty so I love art supplies and all that happy jazz. So it was fantastic! That soon turned into \"let's go to the bar and play pool\" or \"let's go to a party at my buddies house\" or \"let's buy you a drum kit so you can learn to play drums.   It's just never ending. I'm very simple. I enjoy reading, hiking, doing crafts, writing poetry/short stories, decorating, etc. I have sensory problems so loud noises instantly set me into panic. With that said, I've never enjoyed big crowds- such as partying. I've never enjoyed loud music or loud people in general. All these things he is trying to push onto me are extremely loud hobbies. I accept that he enjoys these things but I simply dont.  So, I took a leap and went to a party with him. It was so loud. You couldn't hear anything over the music. I got sick to my stomach because of it and stepped outside. I was the DD so he came out drunk and started 21 questioning me. I simply told him that I was overwhelmed with the noise and that I wasnt having a good time. I told him to go hang out and I would wait in the car. He flipped out and said I was selfish for not attempting to enjoy the things he does. And I do feel like an AH about that but I did truly try and that's how I ended up at this party to begin with.  At that point I was irritated by everything and told him that he needed to stop trying to push his hobbies down my throat with the clause that I need to enjoy myself more. He went back inside and wouldnt say anything to me for the rest of the evening.  AITA?\n",
      "I don’t feel super bad about this, as it was a small thing, but I am moreso just curious on everyone’s opinion.   I went to go walk my dog a few days ago and he just didn’t seem to want to go far. I kept trying to coax him past the first house or two because he usually will go for a nice long walk if I can get him that far. He is just stubborn.   After a couple tries, having not gotten past my own home, we turn around to go back inside. As I am letting the dog through the door I hear someone say “Hey!” and I let the dog go inside and turn around to see a random guy walking towards me. At this point I have my door open and I am watching him walk towards me, a bit confused. He stretches his hand out and I just let him hold it out there and looked at him asking what he wanted. I think I just said “whatsup” something to that effect. He pulled his hand back after a second or two and proceeded to say he is with a cell phone service. I told him im not interested. He said “well who is your carrier?” And I just said “No thanks, were good” then slowly closed the door.   AITA for not shaking his hand? Im not sure what exactly I was thinking as usually I don’t act that way. Im very friendly. But something felt different with this one.\n",

He said he would pay me 20 dollars for each day he worked as some days he didn’t due to there being no work. Mind you, he works at a construction place. At first I said I didn’t need money, but he said he was going to pay me as it could help with my gas money for when I start driving, so I accept and it goes well for the next 2 days. The next week my mom is out of town to attend a business meeting in another state, and also has to visit a site the next week. Monday and Tuesday are great, but Wednesday is where it starts to get weird. He calls me and tells me he’s coming home and to drop the dog on his training pad so he can do his business. I explained to him that it wasn’t necessary as he just went five minutes before. He’s quiet for a bit, then rudely says; “Well that’s not what I asked you, and you need to stop talking back.” I felt as though he was talking to me as if he was my dad. I just say okay and hang up to not cause any drama. My mom calls me later and asks how it’s going, to which I tell her what happened. She said she would call him as she didn’t like how he talked to me andI shouldn’t let him get to me. However I also realized that those circumstances are often with bosses or rude co-workers and not your brother. She also tells me to not let the dog out of the cage as we just got a new floor put  in and she didn’t want him doing his business there. My mom and I say bye then my brother comes and picks up the dog and leaves. I realized that I should have told him about what mom said, to where I text him explaining the situation. He acknowledges it, but I decide to remind him the next day just in case he forgot. I remind him the next day, and he tells me to disobey my mother and to let him run around. I tell him no, then he gets pissed off then leaves. The rest of the week is fine and we have no problems. Next week he is staying with me as my mom doesn’t want me alone another week. I was eating my dinner and he told me to get up and go to the other couch as he had been working all day and he bought me food. I tell him I’m not allowed to sit on the other couch, to which he gets mad and he yells at me about how I need to show him all this respect, and how I need to look up to him as an older brother. He continues this attitude for the rest of the week. Fast forward to next Tuesday, I just cooked him dinner and watched his dog and not once did he tell me thank you. The next day, he bangs on my bed telling me to wake up and how I’m being lazy and begins to loudly repeat all these rules for the day and asks me to repeat them back.. I get pissed and say “I’m not gonna repeat your stupid rules, so leave me alone and stop acting like my goddamn dad.” He gets mad, and stomps out of the house and I slam the door behind him. My family and friends are on my side, but I still wonder AITA?\n",
      "I (f21) used to be head over heels for a friend (m21) for years. We were actually good legit friends for a couple years. Then he slowly just used my body for affection and then turned me away whenever he got a girlfriend before dragging me back in when he was single again. A little over a year ago, the affection turned sexual and he treated me like he actually did have feelings too. He was my first kiss ever. When things got really bad, we stopped talking for five months. I came back to him because I thought things would be better. They were better for like a month and then it just got worse. Before his birthday in December, I bought him presents and he said he would be excited to open them during winter break. He got a girlfriend not long after that, and I threw away all my romantic feelings for him quickly. I also finally realized every single wrong thing he’s done to me for the past few years, the wrong things people told me they were worrying about me for. Recently, he started treating me like a chore, like he “has to be friends with me”. It doesn’t matter how quickly I respond to his messages, he waits at least 24 hours every time. It’s been six months and his birthday presents are still in my house. I don’t want him to be my friend anymore. I don’t want to give him these presents anymore. They consist of a snoop dogg cookbook and several flasks that are disguised to look like bottles of sunscreen and hand sanitizer.  His best friend from high school (m21) is in town. I haven’t seen him since last summer. I’m pretty close to him as well. They both like the same things. I’m going to see him today.  WIBTA if I gave him the birthday presents?\n",
      "Its warm over here in Europe right now. We literally have a heatwave. But even if there isnt that going on my older Brother and my Little sister get annoyed that i run around with tight boxershorts or sportleggins only in the Kitchen,livingroom and so on. I just go there for like 5 mins to get something to eat or to the bathroom and so on to do my own buisness. I guess they are annoyed on the front part which i cant fckn understand. What do they expect when they go swimming and see 60 year old man running around in the slim tight swimmshorts with a buldge at the front? I tell them they can run around with slim fitting things too but yeah doesnt lead to nowwhere.  I will stop that since my mother didnt like it too and its her house. but just out of curiousity just imagine your 18 to 25 or whatever brother runs around with only tigh boxers only would you be annoyed too? I cant wrap my head around this and it seems so weird to me. Im a active dude and like to wear sportleggins or boxers only since hot weather or just i dont want to sweat in clothers without any sense. Please tell me and excuse my bad english/writing\n",
      "Im 14f and struggle with my mental health a lot. I find school extremely draining so when I get home I could sit down and fall asleep easily. So most days of the week I find myself laying in bed after getting home from school with plans to do basic things like doing my homework, having a shower, making stuff or just doing anything productive but eventually I always end up falling asleep and waking up the next day before I’m ever able to do any of that, which really bums me out in the morning. And in my opinion I believe that it’s kind of my family’s responsibility to at least wake me up instead of letting me sleep the whole day. (Also sometimes i go without eating all day because of this)  I’ve brought it up to my parents multiple times and they both blame me for it and tell me I ‘have to wake myself up’ or that ‘I should just stop going to sleep then’. They claim to have tried to wake me up several times, which I don’t remember, but they also know that I’m a very deep and heavy sleeper.   This issue has not just impacted me but also my parents as they say it stresses them out in the morning because I didn’t do my homework the day before so instead I have to do it in the morning, or it worries my mum because I can go days without eating anything except a few snacks etc. Idk what do rlly do about this so AITA???\n",
      "I (43f) just bought a home with my husband (45m).  We had contractors tear down and rebuild the old fence and redo the whole front landscape. And we asked them to take down a homemade basketball hoop which was situated a couple feet from our mail box.   A couple days later the new neighbors introduced themselves to us and asked us why we tore down the basketball hoop \"without asking them first\".   To which we answered that we didn't ask because it was   edit: front of   the property we own. To which they answered that technically we don't own the \"sidewalk\" part and that it was the neighborhood's hoop. True as it was within 10\" of the fence line.  We told them they should buy or get a hoop they can use on their side and they got irritated with us saying that we should pitch in some dollars or helping build a new one.  We told them we wouldn't and they went on and on about how we were setting ourselves on the wrong foot moving in this neighborhood.  AITA for tearing down the basketball hoop on our side of the road?\n",
      "So I bought a new LG Velvet phone from Verizon and it has not performed as well as the phone I was \"upgrading\" from.  I was assured by the salesman that it had a faster processor than my old LG V40 thinQ before I bought it.  After purchasing the phone I noticed that the scrolling on webpages, reddit, facebook, etc is extremely jerky/laggy compared to the V40.  I look at the specs and the V40 appears to my novice understanding to have a faster processor and from my personal experience is a more responsive phone (definitely no jerky reddit scrolling).  With the holidays and having been extremely busy at work returning the phone got put on a back burner.  I call today to see If I can still return it (I bought it on December 18th) and they told me no as I only have 14 days to return the phone (new years day would have been my last chance).  So I call the corporate customer service to see if there is anything they can do for me.  They proceed to tell me IN FACT there is an extension to January 15th for returns but that it may not apply to me if I bought it at a \"franchise\" location and not a corporate location.  I say well I can't tell the difference which is it and the customer service lady kindly calls the Verizon store I purchased my phone at while I wait on hold.  She gets back on the line shortly and tells me that Yes in fact I CAN return my phone to this location and they have to honor the extended return policy.  Heres where it gets dicey....  I call the location and the lady tells me that the Customer Service Rep actually hung up on her after she told them she would not honor the Corporate return policy.  I tell her I'm getting mixed messages and that I feel like I should be able to return the phone because the salesman was either lying or ignorant of what he was selling me.  I never raised my voice, never swore but I was a bit peeved at this point.  After a little bit of back and forth, she repeated twice \"your not special\" and hung up on me.  And now it gets really awkward... I go to the location to try to smooth out this situation, fully prepared to just buy another phone so I could have a non-jerky reddit feed.  I think she is the only person working in this rural Verizon store and I did not want to come off as a crazy person and scare her so I really tried to be docile about the whole thing.  I said I had called earlier about having my LG Velvet replaced, and said I had gotten hung up on earlier.  I asked if she was the one who hung up on me earlier (maybe i'm TA for this)?  She promptly stated that I needed to leave or she was going to call the police.  I said \"OK, but why?\" and she said it was for \"disrespecting her salesman\".  I said \"ok sorry for the disrespect\" and drove home, LG Velvet in hand...  UPDATE: THEY MADE EVERYTHING RIGHT!!!   Frankly I'm shocked, never ever have I had a large business actually do something like this to appease a customer.  I fired off a couple emails, one to the franchise owner and one to the BBB.  I get a call from the store manager saying he talked to the higher up higher ups and they want him to honor the return of the phone!  I got the samsung galaxy note20 ultra and it's soooo much better!  Then later a very professional sounding man at the \"Executive office\" called me and I told him excitedly how much I loved the service and my new phone!!!\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months. He’s much more outgoing and charismatic than me, he’s the guy that walks into a party knowing no one and walks out with the richest guy there inviting him to a beach or something. He works in sales so I guess it makes sense.  For me it takes much more time to get to know people and I only have a few close friends.  I was having him meet my friends for the first time last night. We went out for drinks. My friends all introduced themselves they started talking. They did the usual introductory “where do you work” etc. he started telling a story about work and all three of my friends were charmed by him. The rest of the night my friends only would talk to him and didn’t pay any attention to me.   He brought me up in a few parts of the conversation but my friends quickly shifted the topic back to him.  After we got home I was upset and asked him when he is with me to try and be less outgoing so I get a chance to talk. He said that he thought the goal of meeting my friends was to make them like me and that he tried to include me but they shut him down.  He’s saying that he’s not going to change who he is when around me, but I think he should just be more sensitive to my needs.  AITA?\n",
      "A little bit of context: I am in high school and was at the time; me and this girl were not friends, but were friendly. The altercation took place in Spanish class - a language she already spoke. (not immediately relevant but germane to the conflict)  As a table we were participating in a group activity and she remarked something to me in Spanish, I’m not entirely sure whether or not she intended for me to understand, but because she was looking at me I assumed she was speaking to me. I jokingly replied that I did not understand what she was saying “because it was in Mexican.” Retrospectively I realize the joke was not that funny, but she misheard what I said as “I didn’t understand because she  was  Mexican.” This deeply offended her which is strange given the fact that she wasn’t even Mexican.  She decided to bring this up to the teacher, something I have never seen done since in my high school by anyone because it’s unnecessary. The teacher approached me and asked me to apologize and I replied that I wouldn’t because it was not my fault that she heard what she heard. I clarified what I said, because what I said was very different to what she thought I said. I also clarified that I am well aware the language is Spanish and not Mexican. She said that that was irrelevant and I should still apologize because I had offended her. I said that was of no consequence to me. She called my parents who thought I was way out of line and said I was being borderline racist with my remarks. So AITA?\n",
      "Throwaway because my bf uses reddit (if only for the nsfw subreddits) and I don't want him to see this as he already thinks a bit badly about my mom. English also isn't my first language so I apologize for any mistakes!  My (F21) bday was a few weeks ago and I visited my bf. He's always given me sweet gifts that show how he genuinely thought about me and even remembered things I'd already forgotten I wanted. His gifts aren't always expensive since he's still in school and only gets allowance and occasional bday/xmas/grade money, but it's very obvious he thought about me. For my recent bday he got me something from an anime I like that's also very useful for my hobby. I spent my bday with his family, they got me something as well which I didn't really expect. It was very sweet, useful things I liked and one of them stood out as it looked like it had cost a bit more than I'd expect his family to pay for me. I was extremely happy and grateful for these things and expressed that to them. My little sister had sent me gifts that I didn't expect too. We didn't always have the best relationship and I had the feeling that she'd been somewhat tight on money and time, but she still picked out gifts for me from anime I loved, one anime movie we both loved when we were little and some other stuff with my favourite flower's scent. When I came home my mom proceeded to congratulate me and give me my gifts. My gift was a 3D printed keyring figure from a popular movie franchise, and while I do like the movies she wouldn't know that. I've never talked to her about the movies or watched them with/in front of her, and for all she knew I could hate the franchise or the character. I understand 3D printing is costly, but from what she told me the printer was at her recent work thing where she had to perform a series of IQ and physically oriented tasks (such as making another keyring) and I somewhat have the suspicion that she neither paid for the material, nor that the keychain she gifted me was even made with me in mind but rather as one of the tasks. She didn't even bother removing any stray material before gifting it to me.  I often make and craft gifts for others because I love handmade gifts with thought behind them, and while I understand handmade things don't have to be perfect I'd at least remove stray pieces and/or sand the figure before gifting it to someone. On top of this I got 25 bucks, which i am quite grateful for.  We don't have a lot of money, so I feel like a proper AH for being disappointed in something that was gifted to me for my bday. The reason is that I feel if my mom can spend money on getting a dog, a trainer because the dog is a problem dog and tried to bite my little brother in the face, on her nails and on a Smart TV and other stuff for her bf's daughter's birthday, that she has the money to buy me something she knows I like. I just feel...kind of hurt? I don't know. I shouldn't be.\n",
      "Throw away because if I ATA I don't want to loose all my karma  My boyfriend, our 2 roommates and I live together. My boyfriend is moving out. When talking about how rent and utilities should be split they said utilities will be split 3 ways and rent will still be in half. I asked further and it's because my boyfriend's things are still here. A week later I say if we get all of boyfriends things out of the storage unit that comes with the apartment can we split rent 3 ways. One roommate says no, not until you get all of his things out of the room too. I said that's not very fair.   For a little more context me and my boyfriend shared a room. We slept in the same bed and she even wants his bed gone. Also he doesn't have anything around the house just things in the room I'm currently paying for.  So aita for not wanting to pay half of the rent when they pay the other half.  *Edit I moved in with my boyfriend and his 2 roommates before I moved in the rent and utilities were split 3 ways. Also it's a 2 bedroom apartment and the 2 roommates share one room.\n",
      "My girlfriend and I both work at the same company. Lately, my coworkers have been complaining to me that my girlfriend has been reporting them to management for small things like (shirt tails untucked, wrong color slacks) and they're pissed about it. Basically being an all around tattletale and teachers pet. So I told her to relax a bit and let management handle it or even talk to my coworkers first bc it's not her job to rat them out. I told her I support her for doing the right thing but she got super pissed and said, \"I'm not on her side/ I'm betraying her/ I care about their feelings more than hers\" and now I feel like an ass. AITA?\n",
      "Okay, me (F 23) and my cousin  (F 26) have not been on the best terms for about a year and a half now. Basically because she tries to control me by \"suggesting\" paths in my life and kinda micromanaging me, because she has several times (maybe and probably unintentionally) tried to take my \"title\" from me as the first born of my father (what I mean is that she always tells people she is my bigger sister, she calls my father´s friends or contacts and calls herself my father´s oldest daughter), because she abuses asking for favors all the time and being extremley strict about how she wants them done and I go out of my way to help her but she demands a lot, because when she got engaged she treated me like shit, and many more that has built up hahaha BUT i am not going to tell her to change, mostly because its her problem, and because I am okay knowing how she is and just keeping my distance from her  The thing is, her sister (F 24) messaged me asking if I was okay with her, and yeah a lot has happened between us (F 23 and F26), but for me it´s not something that bothers me in my daily life. So I said that I was fine but also told her that if her sister has a problem with me she should tell me herself and not send her sister to ask, and she kept insisting that she felt something was wrong because of how passive aggressively we (F 23 and F26) talk to each other and I kept saying that I didn´t have a problem, that if I had i would go directly to her and I asked her not to meddle in something that does not consern her. She kept pushing and telling me how I clearly had a problem with her sister and that she didn´t want things to escalate, to the point that I am now mad at her for telling me how to feel and react to something that hasn´t happened or anything. She is now saying that she will talk to her sister about it to help us prevent a fight, and i asked her to back off because if her sister doesn´t have a problem now, then its unnecessary to tell her and push her to see a problem that was not a problem before. And tbh, i think she talked to her before she talked to me, so now Im conscious about something that was not bothering me and I now feel like her sister (F26) does have a mayor problem with me\n",
      "I (36f) inherited the property I live on, due to family drama I wasn't able to take possession of the property until 4 years ago. Since then I've been trying to fix it back up from the years of neglect & destruction my family left in their wake. Due to past trauma, I have to know who is on my property and why they are there if I don't know you personally.   Fast forward to 6 months ago Uncle(50)&wife(48) were kicked out of where they had been living for about 3 years. I knew they had a history of drama but had seemed to chill in the last few years. I said they could stay 1 night just to get their feet under them and come up with a game plan.   I knew it was a bad idea (I've seen how this movie ends), but I wanted to believe they would be different. Of course 1 night became more&after a week I set up some rules: No visitors a night|no drama|no drugs|& if this 1 \"friend\" of theirs came over for any reason I was to be notified BEFORE she came on the property. She & I have bad history. I understand she hasn't done wrong to THEM but she has to me.   I thought I was fair considering I didn' ask for rent, & they had access to all my utilities(this comes to play later.)So I found out they were having people come over while we were all gone. I asked them not to due to my issues.  Fast forward to last night: they had her over W/O notifying me & another person. I initially contacted them about the other person & then walked my dog for bedtime (10pm). It was then I became aware she was here, I called out & asked if it was her to make sure. They confirmed & said she came over to change their flat tire (my uncle is a mechanic himself). I said that was bullshit because there are others here that can help do it, including me. My uncle apologized for not texting me and I told him that wasn't good enough this time because he always talks about how much he respects me but this was very disrespectful & had been happening way more than it should. He said he could fix it and that he would leave, I told him that's not what I said. He said he couldn't keep living like this & I agreed that I can't either. So he said he would be gone by Monday & walked off. I took the dog in & about 5-10 min later both she & my aunt left, I assume taking their other guest as well.   It was about an hour later I got an exceedingly long FB message about how he could hear how hard it was for me to speak up about the disrespect they've shown me but he knew this would happen because he's not a source of income, how selfish and inconsiderate I was being, and how he loved me but this really hurt him. He said that he couldn't believe I was now targeting my own family that loved me and asked if I hated him or my aunt as they have always tried to be respectful. I recognize some of this as gaslighting and love bombing, or at least that's what it seems like to me. I didn't respond, but am I wrong? AITA?\n",
      "Asking because the person I was with was mortally embarrassed and apologized repeatedly to the woman for making her move.  We decided about an hour before the movie started to see if there were any good seats left, and, if there were, we would go.  The theater in question has all reserved seating.  Most of the theater is stadium seating, with a few other rows in the front.  The stadium seats always sell out first, because it is hard to see from the up-close seats right in the front.  When I pulled up the app, there was miraculously a block of three seats left in the stadium seating section!  I bought two, and off we went.  By the time we got there, the showing was listed as \"sold out\" on the theater's display.  We were a tad on the early side--people tend to show up very close to the start time of the movie at this theater because you have already booked your seats.  Unfortunately, of the 15 or so people in the theater, three of them were in our seats.  It was a mother with two young children.  And they were extremely spread out.  They had multiple large bags with them, and so much food and drink.  We approached the woman, who was aware she was in the wrong seats.  She said she had moved because the theater seemed so empty.  I said actually, the show is sold out and people will come right at the start time of the movie.  She seemed to realize at this point that she had to move.    It took an excruciatingly long amount of time for her to gather up all her stuff and the children's food--we actually offered to help, but she declined.   As they walked away, she explained to the children that \"these people\" made them move.  One of the children was very upset and crying.  My movie companion was very upset at me after, saying we could have gone and sat in their seats, and that it was trivial for us to move, but that they had so many things that it was a huge burden for them.  I said their seats were the highly undesirable seats at the front, and that we only decided to see the movie because there were good seats, and we decided to see the movie thinking those would be our seats.  Similarly, this woman had bought tickets knowing where her seats would be.   We also argued over the significance of the fact that they sat in the exact three seats that showed up as available when we opened the app--there were three seats available in the stadium section one hour before the movie.  We bought two of them.  It was weird to see a party of three occupying what I know were the last set of three desirable seats in the theater.  We couldn't decide if that was significant.   We usually go to a lot of movies together, haven't been to a movie since.  AITA?  EDIT: thanks for comments. I think the consensus is that in the situation of me+my friend vs. lady+kids, she was TA. But thinking about it more in the situation of just me and my friend, I think I was the asshole to my friend. I know he really hates confrontation. And I agreed to go to the movies with him knowing how much he hates confrontation and I did initiate talking to the woman without sufficiently checking  that he was on board with doing that. I am going to reach out to him and try to talk and maybe suggest going to a movie with no reserved seating. I prefer reserved seating but I like going to the movies with my friend more.  I do think he needs to stand up for himself more but there are plenty of theaters within easy distance where this just won’t be an issue.\n",
      "For reference, I work part time at a dog kennel, usually only about 12 hours because of my college school schedule. I work 10 hours on saturdays, and 2ish on sundays (On sundays we only have to come in to take care of the dogs since our office isnt open).  My experience with Holidays here so far has been hell. Everyone and their mother boards dogs during the holidays so we end up jam packed with all of our 100 runs being full, not including if we have 2 or 3 dogs in one run (if theyre family pairs), so we usually have well over 100 dogs. Plus cats, but theyre not usually the issue.  The issue is, our holidays work like our sundays do. We come in around 7:30 in the morning, and do all of our work. (Feed the dogs, let them out, water them, clean up messes, medicate, clean the food bowls and clean outside where they poop, ect. anyone who has worked in a kennel would know how ruff it is, pun intended) and then come back at around 5 in the afternoon to do it all again, but also prep food for the next morning.  This is fine on sundays, where im in charge of maybe 20 dogs. But on holidays when we are jam packed, in my past experience I have had to deal with taking care of 45 dogs, almost half of capacity, for only 2 hours of pay. (I get paid 12.50 an hour.) Not only is this barely anything after taxes (around 23 bucks, not even enough to fill my gas tank. I can buy two 10 piece chicken nugget meals from mcdonalds with that much money. Also I just realized that it wouldn't even cover having one dog board here. My paychek wouldnt even be enough to use this kennel for one day.) , but it also ruins my entire day because I have to get up so early, and come home smelling like dog, then have to go back out at 5.  Its physically taxing, and to be honest mentally taxing, and to me its not worth how little I actually get.  However, I feel for my boss, we arent anything corporate, its a locally owned thing, and we are kind of understaffed. Theyre reasoning for not paying me holiday pay, is only since I'm part time. Ive been here over a year, and have been super reliable, rarely calling in and coming in if needed on mornings before i have to go to school. I dont want to be a dick and make things difficult, and i definitely feel as if im overexaggerating things, and that im just being lazy or something. So reddit, aita?  (also, any advice on how to talk to my boss about not wanting to work holidays w/o holiday pay  without  sounding like an ass would be very appreciated, im a terrible self advocate and have a very hard time speaking up in general.   looking forward to responses  EDIT:: my state does not require part time employees to be paid holiday pay, they are in every legal right to do this\n",
      "For purposes of this post my boyfriend will be called Timmy.   So as the title says am I the a** for wanting to slow down working while I go back to school.   A little background in our situation. We have 2 kids and have been together for awhile.   We moved into our current place 4 years ago and I’ve been paying everything since then. He wasn’t working for the first few years and then I got him a job at my company last November, but he quit in July because it was “stressful”.   During this time he did start to buy groceries and stuff for the house, but that was short lived. We are now back to the status quo of me paying for everything and him taking care of the house. Kind of.   Both of our kids are in school all day and I go to work so he’s home by himself all day. I pickup and drop off one kid and he does the other.   I work in sales so it’s very stressful knowing that the only way I get paid is if I make sales. And I cold call all day so that’s another hurdle, but I’ve been maintaining for the past 4 years. I am exhausted.   I decided to go back to school to finish my degree in January. So I was considering asking my boyfriend to get a job and start handling everything so I can get a break and focus on school.   Also to add I have ADHD, bipolar, autism and a whole lot of other crap that makes being a functioning human waaaaay harder than it needs to be. (He is too,but he refuses to see a doctor and has been self medicating for years with zero success but that’s another story)   Basically, I need a break and I want to be taken care of for a change. AITA for that?\n",
      "Hi long time lurker first time poster. I just want to start this with saying that English is not my first language and I’m also dyslexic so bear with me.

I was never close to C because of our age difference but he’s my brother and I do love him.  C got his now wife pregnant when he was 18 and at that time I was 8.  I think he resents me being born and still a child when his kid came around because our parents gave me more attention as I was still dependent on have my parents teach me and taking care of me. That meant that he didn’t get much help from my parents because they still had to take care of me, my sister and my brother.  My brother was old enough to take care of him self but he got help with school from our parents (they gave him money for school) and they hade to spend money for my sister and I so my parents couldn’t give my brother the help he needed. They did offer to let them live with them but they could not support them.  Anyhow we are now adults, my sister and my brother B and I are finished with university and have stable jobs but C doesn’t have one and he’s asking Only me to give him money for being the reason my parents couldn’t give them as much help as they could m. I felt bad and did help them but now every time I give them money they make fun of me and treats me like shit.  My nephew and my brother and his wife basically use me as an ATM and they have never once asked my other siblings to help them. Only me. So I stopped after they made fun of my trauma that I’m still in therapy for.  Now they are saying am an Ah, I feel bad but my parents and other siblings are on my side and has given them the silent treatment. They called me and said that i better make this right.\n",
      "My dad (M 62) is hosting Thanksgiving this year for his children, his ex wife (my mother) and my mother's family because I (F 33) refused to. On my mom's side of the family I am the only person with a space to host family functions. My mom, grandma, uncles, cousins, and my brother (M 29) either having a hoarding problem, no house of their own, or a tiny apartment. They are a mess. Anyway, I always host birthdays, holidays, whatever. I don't normally mind but I had to work til 6pm today, I'm pregnant (very sick from it), had some logistical challenges with furniture, and we also have to go to my husband's side of the family. My dad kindly volunteered to host everyone.  However, I don't really want to go now because he's loaning my brother a large sum of money out of our joint inheritance. My dad would NEVER loan me money like this, even under the same circumstances. My brother has always been the favorite, and when I pointed it out to my dad-- how he's never supported me like he has my brother, he denied it. I'm not bothered by potentially losing money from my inheritance, I don't really care. I take care of myself and am independently successful. But my dad has built my brother structures that lay empty on abandoned business adventures, given him resources for several other business attempts that were abandoned, ect. That being said, my brother is capable, he has a very good job, no debt, and a healthy savings (but no other assets).   In comparison, my dad refused to help me through college, made me give back money that my mom gave me for my wedding, and also took money out of savings without saying anything to me to buy a car I had no say in when I was 18ish. He's said more than once that we need earn success ourselves. I would be less bothered if he just admitted his favoritism and told me why. I'm not a screw up or anything, I have my own family now, assets, a good job, no addictions, or anything he's embarrassed by. My dad does love me and has helped me out in other ways like helping me find a good but cheap roofer and helping me pass inspection, mowing a piece of empty land I owned a couple of times, letting me move back in (with rent!!) So I could save for a house. But he doesn't invest in my future the same way he invests in my brother.   Should I just get over it and go? Or would bailing be acceptable?\n",
      "First and foremost, I’ll never do anything to harm her. She’s a child, she’s going into 4th grade and wouldn’t harm a fly. She’s a sweetheart, and right now her father and I have been taking her on daytrips because she won’t be an only child soon as I am pregnant. Here’s the problem: I don’t like her that much. I can’t shake this dislike that I know is linked because she’s not my daughter (long story, I married my high school crush but he had a previous marriage, had said stepdaughter, etc) and I feel awful for it. No amount of therapy has helped and I’d never tell him I don’t like his daughter because that’s absurd.  I had made a post about this previously but I wasn’t pregnant then, now I’ve begun to overthink it. Kids can tell when you hate them and I’m worried she can tell that I don’t really love her and I’m afraid I never will. I feel like an asshole for it even though I can’t change these feelings.  AITA for not liking her?\n",
      "My daughter Eva has recently gotten engaged to the guy she's been dating for a few years, Charles. I've met him a few times, but we never got to know eqch other well since my wife and I live very far away from them. Now that they're engaged, I wanted to know more about him. He's fairly open about his personal life (parents, friends, hobbies, etc) but very evasive and tight-lipped about his job. I found out he works for our country's Intelligence Agency, but he refuses to say anything else- what exactly his job is, whether it at any point requires relocation, whether it's dangerous, etc. I realize his job is classified, but I just feel uneasy with my daughter marrying a guy without knoeing anything about his professional life, especially since he works in a potentially very dangerous field.   I brought this up with Eva, asking if he had ever told her about his job or what he does. I figured he wouldn't have told her everythong, since his job is classified, but i expected him to have told her something or another in the better part of 4 years they've been together. But she told me she knows only what I do- that he works at the Intelligence Agency.  Unlike me, she doesn't seem worried about it, but I am.There's a chsnce he's just an analyst sitting at a desk writing reports, but there's also a chance he's doing something potentially risky or dangerous. And I don't think it's right for Eva to make that decision to marry him without knowing what he really does.   I told her this and said that if I were her, I would try to get some more info out of him- not everything, of course, but at least a general description of the field he works in- or else reconsider.  She got mad at me for my lack of 'trust' in Charles. I simply don't know how i can trust him if I know so little information. But Eva insists that I have to, or I'm an asshole.  Am I?\n",
      "Hi. This happened a few minutes ago and I have screenshots so that I can copy exactly what was said.   So since I was 11 (I’m now 18f) was apart of this community online where a bunch of people kinda just talked with each other and we kinda became friends. It’s like one big group chat. There’s this one guy on there, let’s call him Mike. I just met him last year.  When I graduated high school last year I left this community. Overtime it became toxic and full of drama and just overall bad vibes. So I thought it was a perfect time, I deactivated my account and left after speaking about it a couple times in the chat. I have put out my info and said if anyone wants to contact me they’re free to.  Only one person did, aka my best friend on there.   6 months pass and I had only reactivated my account twice to get a photo from there (I couldn’t find it in my gallery) and then the second time was with my best friend to look at old memories of us from when we were kids. After 10 minutes of us going down memory lane I just kinda left my profile open and left. I opened it today to talk to some of the people there and wow the atmosphere had changed. I didn’t know how to talk to anyone or even include myself in anything. People had been exposed for preying on younger members, some people being manipulative, etc. I saw that Mike was online — having talked to him once or twice I popped in to say hi! I missed you, and low and behold he goes OFF on me. He starts saying that I’ve been back “several” times and have never contacted him or “breathed in his direction” now. He started being mean and I felt attacked. Me and mike were never really that close, to be honest, an occasional laugh at each other’s jokes, talking about a band we both liked. We were ‘friends’ but we weren’t best friends. I didn’t know what to say so I said “I’d explain myself but I doubt it matters. My bad for reaching out. Won’t try to again”. Que his rant in the public chat room about how I’m manipulative and how i won’t make a fool out of him.  AITA for apparently saying something manipulative? I’m not even sure what I said? If so it wasn’t my intention?\n",
      "Hi guys,  Little back story, we've been married for 2 years, known each other for 4. I love them dearly, and couldn't imagine life without them. They're my rock and I'm theirs in return, and I'd never do anything to hurt them. However, they suffer from depression.  They suffered from physical and emotional abuse a lot of their life and I can see how it's effecting them. I do my best to help them, and they've always said how great I am and how I've helped with their issues.   As much as I love them I do need some time to myself. I'm a really positive person and being around negativity takes its toll sometimes. This isn't a lot, probably a few times a year.  So would I be the asshole if I made an excuse and went out alone to a concert or out to the cinema for a few hours?\n",
      "I(14f) live with my older sister(21) and she often takes care of me.  For awhile I’ve been considering her my mom and I recently made the mistake of calling her that. I didn’t mean to call her that but she wasn’t happy that I did. She says that the only things I’m allowed to call her are “sis” or her name. I explained that it was a accident and she told me not to do it again. Is what I did wrong\n",
      "So I had the worst parenting moment ever. I kinda snapped at my 3 year old and yelled not at the top of my lungs but definitely raised my voice and she knew and cried.  We are together almost 24/7 365 and are very close and if I ever raise my voice because I’m even startled she gets upset.  After about 15 seconds I snapped back to reality and realized she is 3 and felt horrible and got her the some chocolate milk and apologized and told her daddy should never get angry and I’m sorry and I got the stuffy she wanted and all tucked in for her nap.  She has a very difficult time sleeping as do I.  Background I’m a stay at home dad. I have 3 girls and 2 boys 3 of which are step kids. I don’t sleep and have some other issue like ptsd.  Anyway my partner also has some issue including anxiety. She was worried about someone breaking in and got a whole security system installed.  She put a camera in the babies room.  A few other cameras through out the house.  Anyway after my incident where I raised my voice(just my youngest daughter and I today other kids away for the week) I went back to cleaning.  Anyway I check my phone about an hour later and my partner had been texting and calling like a bunch of times for a few minutes.  I saw the messages about an hour later so I called back and she is frantically asking me if everything is ok and she saw me yell at the toddler.  Anyway I was angry because I felt like she spied on me for one or micromanaged me. But even if she needs to watch the camera all day wouldn’t she have seen an hour of the baby fine and my apology and everything and me calm down.  I felt like I understood her texts and being worried but when we spoke an hour later the accusations and worry should have been subsided.  I feel like if she could randomly see me have my worst parenting moment ever she could have seen the part where I calmed down and realized I was wrong and handled it properly.  Instead I get an hour later rehashing and accusation of something she already knows was resolved and she only saw through a security camera I didn’t know she was watching. She thinks she did nothing wrong . Am I the asshole legitimately\n",
      "We are on a 1 night trip. My child (2yo) started getting sleepy and now is slowly warming up. He doesn't complain, but has a hard time falling asleep. My wife decided to go cuddle him, because he was 1 hour past his usual sleeping time.  Now I am not doing anything In particular, but surfing Reddit. She asked me to go buy our son ibuprofen for the night. I told her no, we can't take his temperature as we don't have a thermometer, so I wouldn't give him anything.   She insisted. I told her to go buy it and give it to him herself if she really was desperate for it. She says I am the asshole for not going to get it as she is cuddling him and I am not doing anything productive.   Tomorrow we will be home by 10 am\n",
      "Hi..getting straight to the point. So there's this colleague of mine, let's call her Anne, who is a few years senior to me in my lab. She comes across as a very sweet, helpful person to anyone at first but that's all a farce. Since the beginning, she has been pointing fingers at me whenever anything goes wrong with any system even though it is not my fault. I've seen Anne make multiple mistakes in handling such systems but never make a fuss about it whereas she creates a scene in front of everyone blaming me for every tiny thing but with a very fake accent and smile of hers. So recently, I could not optimise a system n did not understand what could have gone wrong. I asked Anne for help who told me she doesn't know what is wrong with the system n that I'm not doing anything wrong. Then in front of our supervisor, she tells what the problem was and that it was very obvious which I ignored. She then proceeded to lecture me on how I should be careful with every tiny thing and that she wants to help me but I don't consult with her in things. This is not a one off incident and has happened a few times till now. I was being professional and did not retort back to anything. But I don't trust her at all and she can very well do this in the future. And I was thinking about recording our conversations on any work related discussions in the future from now on to protect my interests. WIBTA if I do so?\n",
      "We have been in a relationship for the last 3 years and she is interested in marriage.. she has been very adamant that I don't have right to know why she got divorced from her 10 year marriage. irrespective of how long I know her,I personally feel I need to know what happened..  TL;DR: girlfriend wants to get married but doesn't want to reveal why she got divorced\n",
      "For whatever reason he decided that I was the cause of their divorce. Every time he picked up my siblings (I was 12) he wouldn't even look at me. He blamed me and spent the whole weekend telling my siblings why they should hate me. So once every few months (when he decided to see my siblings, even though he had every weekend) he would get them and then I would spend the next two weeks trying to convince them that this wasn't my fault. I'm the oldest... They were young and just believed every thing he said. Now he is living with my brother and his family (I'm 32 next month) they all keep telling me to forgive him and accept him. He has never showed any interest in having a relationship.. I mean he took my siblings and their family to Disney Land and did not invite me or my family. I found out on accident on a phone call to my sister in law..  Now I'm being asked to forgive and forget by my siblings. I can't do it. He literally lives 2 minutes from my home and has never stopped by.  He doesn't call or make any effort to be a part of my life. I have long since given up on any sort of relationship.  He keeps telling them he wants a relationship but has never tried to contact me for one. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "A little background here. My girlfriend is planning on getting her driving liscence this summer, so in order for her to have some \"experience\", she came up with the idea to give her my car from time to time so she can go in a somewhat empty road (~3kms) and practice.  I know that it's not a very responsible thing for me to do, but she says it brings her joy and always ends up talking me through it, we've been doing this thing for around 3 months now, averaging 3 times a week.  The thing is, she honestly doesn't learn anything. All she does is get in the car, blast music, make some snapchat videos of her driving and never pays attention to what remarks i have to say ( due to loud music ), drives fairly fast for someone who has not gotten his liscence yet (60kmph).  It always makes me very nervous to be sitting there besides someone who has close to no idea what to do behind the wheel of a car driving so recklessly.  Today we were with a friend of hers, and, as expected she asked me to drive. I said no, multiple times, but she just kept on begging and begging but that was it, it was the first time i had the courage to say a firm NO. She then got angry and didn't say a thing until she got home where she bombarded me with messages of her claiming that i humiliated her in front of her friend, that i'm tightfisted with gas money, and that i only care about my car. She also said that she is going through a rough patch ( and i know it ) and that i couldn't do the least of things that bring her joy which really got me thinking i may be the asshole.  AITA reddit ?\n",
      "Long story short here is that my sister in law is (in my view) a ridiculous person who has a tendency to shit talk literally everyone and also an almost psychotic inability to apologize or own up to anything she does. She had said several bad things about me and I found out and I had told her I wanted an apology. Here is how things went from that point:  1.) “I won’t apologize for things I never said”  Then after a few days when my wife and her father had convinced her I knew she said the things and there was no point in lying:  2.) “Why should I have to apologize for this? I’m sure he’s said something about me before too. He should apologize to me first and then I will to him.”  I basically told her I’m not apologizing for some hypothetical thing she thinks I said, and again my wife and her father told her that was pretty silly.  3.) She finally said she would apologize. I brought snacks over to her house (for her kids and her) and sat down to talk with her. Her apology basically consisted of 10ish minutes of telling me how hurtful  my wife and I have been towards her (we’ve literally done nothing, I see this lady like 4 times a year at holidays lol) and that she felt that since no one else seems to care about her or defend her, that she should take matters into her own hands and say some bad things and spread some lies about me. I literally will quote her here: “For doing to you what everyone else does to me constantly, I am sorry. I should have known I’d be the only once held to any standard.”   I basically laughed in her face and said she needs a therapist and to stay away from me and my kids after that. She screamed and cried and is apparently furious and telling everyone that I made her grovel at my feet and then still attacked her anyways. I have ghosted since then and plan to maintain the ghosting until the end of my life.\n",
      "Obligatory apology for mobile formatting.  Background: I (25M) and my Wife (25F) had our first child this past year and needless to say, it’s been a wonderful, if hectic, journey. We currently live with my MIL and while we appreciate the extra help, we would love our own space to grow and raise our child. We both work at a hospital and have decent paying jobs so we wouldn’t have to worry about a paying a mortgage.   Recently, my Grandparents have been looking at selling their house and moving to another state. This has been kind of a sad moment for our family, as it’s the last family home that we had growing up and we hate to see it go, but we had made our peace with it. However, while visiting my Grandparents recently, they asked my wife and I if we would like their house. There were of course a couple of conditions, but all were very reasonable and it would help both my Wife and I and my Grandparents in the long run.  Here’s where I’m wondering if I would be the AH. I have two sisters. One is single and has a steady, decent paying job, hereto referred to as (L). While the other (W) has a part-time job and lives with my parents.  L has expressed that she wants the house multiple times throughout our lives and casually says things like “well I get the house” or “when it’s my house” whenever we get talking about my Grandparents. WIBTAH if I accepted their house? I don’t really want to anger my sister, but this would be a wonderful opportunity for my Wife, Child, and I.  Also, in case this comes up, we don’t bring up what happens when my Grandparents pass every time that we talk about them. Sometimes my Grandparents bring it up or we start talking about how devastating it would be to lose them and we happen to get around to discussing what would happen to their things. My Wife and I expect nothing and just want to spend as much time with them as we can\n",
      "This weekend I got hit by a car while crossing the street. The driver was distracted and didn’t see me in the crosswalk. I was very fortunate that they were not going very fast, I only ended up with a fractured wrist.   After it happened I told myself I wasn’t going to try and get a payday out of this, that I would just seek to be made whole for medical and other injury related expenses. However I have been slowly changing my mind, my hand hurts constantly, I have to wear a brace for potentially 6 weeks that pretty much makes my left hand useless. I can’t play video games, I can’t effectively use my computer, pretty much everything I enjoy doing I can’t do and if I can it takes way more effort.   This has gradually had me thinking that I should maybe seek punitive damages. I have no idea exactly what I would seek, but I am setting up a consultation with a lawyer to discuss this whole mess. Part of me feels like if I did this though I would be an asshole, the driver was extremely upset they hit me. They stayed and called 911 for me and were honest when talking to the police. So WIBTA if I tried to get some punitive or compensatory damages added to the total?\n",
      "I (13) was playing soccer in the park with my brother and cousins and scored a couple of goals on one of my cousins (25), celebrating wildly. He didn't appreciate it so launched a voluminous phlegmy one straight into my face. I wanted to hit him but decided against it and stormed home. Later they returned and he apologised (half-heartedly). I did not accept it and haven't spoken to him since. He's always treated me differently (badly) and this was the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't intend to speak to him again. It's come up again now because he's getting married next week and I am the only one in the family not going. They think I'm overreacting.\n",
      "I am an APP, and my last patient of the day called to let us know they were going to be 15-20 minutes late. My clinic actually asks that you arrive 15 min prior to your appointment for check-in and rooming, so that your provider can see you right at your appointment time. However, most show up right on time or 5-10 min late, and we do still see them. If it becomes 15 min past your appointment and we have not heard from you we no show you. On this particular day, the patient called ahead and informed us they'd be 15-20 minutes late, and I unfortunately was not able to stay potentially 20 min late at work. I made sure it was not an urgent visit, and checked my schedule to see I had openings the very next day and throughout the rest of the week. So I asked that the patient be rescheduled, and left work. I was texted later to be informed the patient was very upset and refused to ever see me again because they are always running late so if I can't wait then they are not going to be able to be my patient. I feel bad and guilty, but at the same time I was raised to be on time to things. It honestly blows my mind being on time is the minority at my clinic. I think there is a level of entitlement and disrespect for others time with this, but I also do not want to be inaccessible or not understanding to my patients. AITA?\n",
      "Disclaimer: I´m not a native english speaker, pardon me for any grammatical mistake.  Here is the story:  My boyfriend and I have been living at his grandmother´s house for almost 3 years ago. We live in the first floor,  while my father in law and his partner live on the second floor. His partner´s son comes almost every weekend to spend time with his mother, but instead of actually doing it he´s just chilling with his boyfriend, and using his mom as a cooker for both of them.  My father in law is leaving for a five day trip along his partner. His partner´s son is coming to the house completely uninvited and without had asking for permission first to me or my boyfriend. He believes himself entitle to come whenever he wants. I got mad for this, I told him he can´t come uninvated, especially ´cause I wanted that spare time for cleaning the house. He uses the house and never cleans it. I told him if he had asked, I would have totally been ok. It´s his lack of asking what drives me mad. He gives a shit about me getting mad and is coming anymay. On top of that, his mother gave me food so I´m the one cooking for his son and his boyfriend, and hell no, I´m not going to do that. The boy is 18 years old, I´m not babysitting him.  &#x200B;  Note: my boyfriend´s grandmother is not living in the country right now, so we´re the ones taking care of the floor she used to live.

      "My fiancé 43(m) and I 30 (f) have been living together for close to 2 years. We met working at a gas station making the same pay. Since then he’s moved to working at a grocery store and I did too for 2 years. This year I went into banking. I’ve moved up quickly and make decent money. I pay the full rent of $1200 while he pays for groceries toiletries. I help with food sometimes and I also buy the pets stuff and pay the vet bills. He is angry and thinks I should help more with the other bills. Our rent includes everything.  I still work a day at the grocery store for extra money (I use that weekly to buy food or buy our pets stuff) he thinks it’s not fair he pays for “everything”. I offered to split everything 50/50.

My friend told me to leave €5 down for a tip, (which wasn't extra, it was part of what he owed for drink/food) I said no as that means I'm paying for someone else's meal partially as they only put in the correct amount they owed. I said my friend to leave extra if he wants to leave a top, and he said no its in the cash I have you.   I didn't leave a tip, as it's not in Ireland culture, but he keeps saying I'm stingy.

      "So recently my (22M) sister (27F) asked me to babysit her 5 year old daughter for the day as her and her friends wanted to go out for the day, that was fine and I said yes as I was free for the day. However, when I came to her house, she told me that I wasn’t allowed to give her lunch. I asked why and she told me it’s “setting habits for the future” so her daughter can have a “beautiful slender figure”. She also said that it’s part of her own “beauty program” where her daughter is not allowed to have lunch in a day because she doesn’t want her to be come overweight. I told her it was ridiculous to not allow a FIVE YEAR OLD to have lunch, she just said whatever and left.  About three hours after my sister had left, her daughter (let’s call her Zoe) started saying she was very hungry. There was still around 2-3 hours until my sister came back so, I gave Zoe an apple and made her a sandwich to keep her happy because it didn’t feel right to leave her hungry like that.  When my sister got back, I told her that Zoe was hungry so I gave her some food to eat and that I had only given her an apple and a sandwich. However, my sister was very irritated by this, and said that I “knew what she had requested” but that I was “purposely not doing what I told you to do just because you want to wind me up”. I told her, that she was being a terrible parent by refusing to give her daughter lunch. This made my sister even more angry, she said that it was ”her parenting style“ and that she “only wants the best for Zoe” and that it was “not your child so you have no say in this” eventually she started shouting and made me leave.

      "I female 16 and my friends female 16-17 are going to a friend darcys beach house for two days and three nights. Between my friends Laura and Anna there is a lot of tension. Personally I’m closer to Anna because Laura can be really sensitive to anything and often blows situations out of proportion. However darcy and Laura are quite close. Darcy invited me, friend a, friend b and Emma as well as Laura to go on this trip. I could kinda understand why she didn’t invite Anna but I still felt really bad about it. However friend b can’t come so darcy decided to invite a new friend if ours to come with us. I get on well with friend c and we’re quite close. However I felt like from Anna’s perspective it will appear like we’re leaving her out deliberately. From previous conversations I know that she has issues with this and that it causes her huge amounts of anxiety. As people will be posting photos of the trip online I thought that it would be a horrible way for her to find out and would probably isolate her. I expressed this to darcy. I didn’t expect her to invite Anna if she didn’t want to but like at least help me solve this issue. She just told me to continue keeping it a secret. I didn’t feel like this was an okay thing to do as I value my friendship over a trip. So I told Anna about it. She was obviously upset but she agreed that this is a better way to find out. She was angry at darcy though for excluding her and not telling her about it. My friend Emma agrees that it was the right thing to do but darcys pissed at me and my whole group are conflicted. I thought I was doing the best thing for everyone but AITA\n",
      "Buckle up, this is going to be long.  Twin sister: TS  Friend 1: F1  Friend 2: F2  The crappy way our school term is structured means that there are about three weeks of a whirlwind of due assignments.   I had these two friends in a lot of my classes, and had group assignments with them for three classes. TS had a group assignment with both of them for one class.  Well, they both proceeded to be “sick” during the most stressful two weeks of term. A whole two weeks. They had expressed repeated dread on doing work on a presentation for the class they had with TS. Coincidentally, they left right before work on that presentation started.  They did almost zero work on ALL assignments they had, including the one class with TS and three classes with me. The two friends being away meant TS was alone in her class with them. She had to organise a huge presentation by herself, way too much work for one person and her group had already been smaller than recommended anyway, and for a few nights she sobbed and cried over the stress.  They appeared on one day in the middle of their “sickness” because even though they “felt like dying.” They were sent to school by their parents. They seemed fine, but said things like “I literally couldn’t go 2 minutes without having a coughing fit this morning and I vomited twice” while not coughing once and seeming physically fine.   They both did basically no work in TS’ class when they were there anyway, they just played sims.  I first just hinted at the fact that I was annoyed, because I knew that  F1 was EXTREMELY sensitive and good at playing the victim, and F2 was angered very easily.   I decided to confront them separately over text. Here’s roughly how it went:  Me: Hey, I’m kind of irritated about how you dumped all the work on TS and I. Both of you were coincidentally sick during the most busy part of term, and didn’t do any work during that time, despite completing a school day without a hitch. I understand it’s a very stressful time but TS was breaking down over this multiple times. I would just like you to apologise to TS, please.   F1: Hey, it really upsets me you would lie like this. I was genuinely really really sick and couldn’t do anything. And about the “lil jabs” you were doing (you know you were doing them on purpose) was too far and you’re overreacting, like it’s been a while just drop it, I’m really really sad that you’d think I would do that. I’m not like that.  Then with F2,  Me:  essentially the same thing as the first text to F1   F2: Proceeds to get very angry but eventually admits to  some  of her wrongdoing and I leave it at that. Still no apology for either of them.  This happened months ago, but I just thought about how I ended up having to say sorry to them. There are many instances where I feel like I can’t tell them the truth about anything because they’d get mad and turn our other friends against me. Honestly, it’s making me consider burning some bridges.\n",
      "A dispute between my friend and I. He came over to my flat so we can play call of duty together. I had my ps5, which I play on my monitor and he bought his ps5 to play on my tv in the living room. My ps5 was plugged into the living room tv, which had been working fine. I moved my ps5 to the monitor so my friend can use his ps5 on the tv. However, my friend’s ps5 did not work on the living room, neither did mine afterwards (no signal HDMI).  After my friend spent four hours trying to fix it, the ps5 was still not working on the living room tv.   My friend wanted to bring my other tv from my room into the living room to see if it works. I stressed (need to emphasise I stressed a lot) that I have tried playing ps5 on that tv before, where the same problem occurs as the living room tv. My friend was adamant to try it. I said to him “if I bring the tv from my room to the living room, you have to take it back if it does not work”. He heard me but did not say anything.   I bought the tv to the living room. He tried and failed. I refuse to take the tv back to my room and have told my friend to do it. He refuses because he says that he was trying to help me resolve the problem (he spent 4 hours trying to fix it and would not stop despite me telling him to forget about it).   Who should take the tv back?\n",
      "At Target, if you buy something with a coupon and then return it, they give you back the original amount. E.g if an item cost $10 and you had a $3 coupon, they would still give you $10 if you returned it.   I was made aware of this loophole about three years ago. I have never really tried to commit coupon fraud and I’ve simply returned things that I sincerely didn’t want with the knowledge that I’d get x more dollars back.   Well, last week, a ton of coupons came in the mail. It was like $80 worth of coupons. I had the idea to buy a bunch of shit from Target then try to return all of it, which would give me a stipend of $80.   So I bought all the items. Then about three days later, I tried returning four items (skin moisturizer, hand soap, lotion, and facial wash.)   The employee looked at my receipt really closely, then told me that I couldn’t return beauty products that i bought with coupons. It’s a “new policy” which I know is bullshit because I called all the other Targets in the surrounding area and none of them had any policies like that.   Anyways, they refunded me only the hand soap. But I have to ask: AITA for trying to commit coupon fraud?\n",
      "My husband and I bought my mother and father-in-law's house as of December and they have most of their things out, but have left behind large, key items - notably a freezer with 5+ year old food in it that is located in our garage. It's generally out of the way, but I'd love to have it gone. Husband and I have a new fridge/freezer combo coming on Monday and I'd like to put our old fridge/freezer in the garage for extra storage.  Mother and father-in-law do not have a house. They live out of a 5th wheel and have a mobile home about a thousand miles away from us. They have six large storage units full of stuff and they would not be able to cram their freezer in the storage unit without de-cluttering. Their end game is to buy a cabin, but they have no set date as to when that might be and are master procrastinators, so we could be stuck with their half-full freezer for years to come.  Would I be the asshole if I told them to move their freezer come Monday?\n",
      "My business partner over the last year had recently decided he wanted to move out of the country and walk away from the business. He dropped this on me about 1 month out from his move and has since been out of the country for another month. I have no ill will for him and understand why he did what he did but here is where money is involved. When we started the business we had put down a 5000$ deposit with one of our vendors. Now that he has walked away he wants his share of that deposit back. I told him he would get his share when the vendor returns the deposit to me, he will get what's owed to him, not a second later.   Him and I still keep in touch as we're good friends and i let him know how I'm doing. Recently business has been really thriving and I've earned a lot of money as a result. He used this information as a way to ask for his cut of the deposit saying \"it's money owed to him by the business.\" I also know he's tight on money and could use it.  While I don't disagree with that, I still believe I should only pay him back when I get the deposit back from my vendor. The way I see it is, he walked away and left me with the burden of having to collect that deposit back eventually. Now suddenly since I'm doing well he feels like I should pay him out of what I'm earning and take the deposit whenever I get it.   So AITA for making him wait even though I could easily afford to pay him his cut with my current earnings?\n",
      "I (16f) was best friends with this girl who told our friends + the whole school that her older brother (who goes to the same school) was a drug dealer and an abusive/mean person (he was quiet and kept to himself so no one thought anything of it)  Over time, I noticed my bsf become more and more addicted to heavy drugs. She told me that her brother supplies her and that he’s fine with it and even brings it home knowing they have a 10yr old sibling. I couldn’t help but feel concerned but I kept it to myself until I eventually couldn’t.  She was never a great friend to me, often left me for people who were more popular, even if that meant I had to eat alone.  I saw her brother at school and straight up told him that she’s addicted and he needs to stop being okay w/ it and supplying her because she’s really young. I was just trying to look out for her.   Well, I found out he’s never done drugs in his life and is actually a very religious person. He wasn’t abusive either, not that I know of. When I told him that his sister was telling everyone he was a drug dealer he looked like he wanted to cry. He was genuinely shocked and didn’t believe me until I showed him proof.  Fast forward - she knows that I told him and called me a bunch of names. She hates me and made sure the whole school knew how terrible of a person I was. Everyone turned against me bc of her and I have no friends now. I tried to speak my truth but no one would believe me because she was always more popular. I guess I did ruin her life.  Am I the asshole?\n",
      "I love my mom like nobody's business, but she has no filter and is incredibly... upsetting. She only talks about how bad her life is and drugs and abuse and blah, blah... it's upsetting not only because it's a subject I'm uncomfortable with, but as an incredibly empathic person i  cannot  handle hearing it. There are other things that she does that makes me uncomfortable, but I won't divulge to protect her.   She and my dad have been separated for a long time and were never married.   TL;DR, I don't want to see my mother this Thanksgiving, AITA for this?\n",
      "Me (17x), my mom (49f) and my dad (55m) live together. My sister (22 f) lives abroad. This evening she video called us and the conversation went to what i should expect and prepare for when i go to college and live abroad/in a dorm.   I kept getting interrupted during the conversation, which has become pretty normal to me. I usually get interrupted most of the time. when im clearly saying something and everyone else is quiet/done with a topic, someone (usually my parents) chooses to interrupt me 5 seconds in to say something else. After theyre done speaking they'll go \"oh werent you saying something\" and usually by then ive lost interest in saying what i wanted to say/the conversation topic changed/i forgot so i just go \"oh its ok nevermind it\" (they get angry at me when i do this though and demand me to speak anyways)  this time I kept trying to say something and got interrupted twice already, but didnt say anything. the third time i tried saying it and i was WELL into what i was trying to say and my mom cut me off to say something else, and i lost my cool and went \"WHY DO YOU PEOPLE KEEP INTERRUPTING ME?? LET ME SPEAK PLEASE.\"my mom just stared at me dumbfounded for a second before getting up wordlessly and going to the kitchen and then upstairs to do some work without saying goodbye to my sister (im pretty sure she was just trying to get out of the situation). I realized what i did and felt really bad, and after the call was soon over i went upstairs and apologized to her, and she said its alright but her voice was wavering and she looked like she wanted to cry. i felt so horrible.  AITA for yelling at her? i think i shouldn't have raised my voice but ive tried telling them that i dont like being interrupted politely in the past and i was at my wits end this time.  (please excuse my lack of punctuation im too tired to care)\n",
      "I was having dinner with my wife and a friend and his wife at a restaurant. I already had had a lot for the main course so when they asked if we wanted to get dessert i declined but the others got some. My friend asked me why I didn't have any and said the chocolate cream was delicious and I should give it a try.   I said that I really shouldn't be having any dessert since I would get too fat. I'll look like Fat Thor I said. My friend's wife seemed shocked, and when I asked her if anything was wrong she said that that was so rude and said I should give an apology to her husband. I didn't really get it because I only joked about my weight so when I asked her she said it was really rude I would call myself fat when I was skinny and it would hurt his feelings. He said it was no big deal and I could make jokes if I want to, it didn't bother him. But she still said I should apologize.   I think that's ridiculous, and said he didn't even mind it and I didn't say anything about him so I wouldn't. AITA?\n",
      "I apologize for being all over the place. I don't have a good relationship with my stepmother. She is a story teller- it is more about the appearance of the situation than what actually happens. I do not get along with her despite being married to my dad 20+ years. She comes from a family that is quite co-dependent. Her siblings are always needing baliouts, and her nieces and nephews are following the same path, with many of them in the 40s still living with their parents. Her family did no wrong, always praised everything regardless of poor choices or bad habits. With me, I didn't get the same treatment. I would be told in one breath I need to socialize more, but then when I found interests, I was told she wasn't a taxi service. I started working as soon as I could, becoming self-sufficient besides a place to stay. I left home at 21 after graduating college, marrying and moving away. She is bitter that I have never asked for help or have no dependency on her.  Since then, my family has expanded, and I have been content with only focusing on my family's interests. The struggle comes with maintaining a relationship with my dad, obviously it is a packaged deal with my stepmom. I would try to make trips at least once a year to their house, but the past couple of years, my family dynamic has made it such that travel is difficult. Conversely, their ability to travel isn't restricted. My dad has been retired for several years and my stepmom works remotely. They actually travel lots of places but seem to avoid my house like the plague (they have a weird thing about staying at my house). When they do come, they either leave the same day or next morning, and most times this equates to more time spent traveling than actually visiting.  If social media wasn't a thing, I'm sure this wouldn't be as obvious, but my stepmom is online constantly and losing an unspoken (read: in her head) competition of having the best grandkids. Her friends are constantly sharing stories or pictures of their grandkids. She makes passive aggressive posts about how family isn't what it used to be, family is always supposed to visit their grandparents, don't come to her funeral if you don't want to visit her when she is alive, she misses her grandkids, etc. One, out of my siblings, I'm the only one with kids so she might as well tag me in those posts. Two, she doesn't grasp that her friends situations are different from her own. Those people live either with their kids/grandkids or within 15 minutes driving time and are actively participating in the grandkids' lives.  Here's where I'm at a crossroad. Today she boldly asked for pictures. I avoid giving her pictures because she shares them online as if she was present for them and gets the credit/sympathy for it. WIBTA if I tell her I'm not sending them because I don't want her putting them online? I've avoided this direct message to not cause strife in my dad's life.\n",
      "So  I officiate a lot of weddings it’s my job and in the town I live in,wedding wise I’m pretty popular and I 26(Nonbinary) was supposed to officiate my friends 28(f) wedding last month. A few days before the wedding my chronic illness flared up and I was hospitalized and was told I needed surgery. I felt bad that I couldn’t go,so I found someone to officiate the wedding and even offered to pay because I felt really bad, and wanted my friends wedding to go perfectly. My friend told me she just needed me for a few hours and I should have sucked it up or at least popped a couple of pills and discharged myself from the hospital for the day. She ended up canceling the wedding and told me I was a ah for ruining her special day her family agrees with her. I don’t think I’m the ah but coming from a family friend and her parents were like another set of parents to me I feel really bad.   Edit: A few things to clarify about the situation.    the condition and surgery wasn’t life threatening I have pcos and I had to get 2 cysts removed because if they burst on there own it could cause damage to my ovaries which could affect my fertility according to my doctor.   the bride has been a friend since we were 3 and her parents were always like parents to me as well.   my friend and her family wasn’t always like that until she met her fiancé he comes from and has money.   thank you all so much for the advice on insurance and stuff but I’m canadian so it’s a little bit different here.   she is still planning on getting married she moved it to December for a ‘Christmas wedding’ she needed some time to get over the fact I wasn’t going to be at her wedding (her cousins words) she is planning on using the officiate that I suggested.    I took everyone’s advice and cut contact. I wasn’t even technically hired for the wedding I was doing it for free because she was like a sister. I talked to her this morning trying to see what is going on with her because she was never like this before but she showed no remorse so I cut ties for good. Thank you all so much for the advice.\n",
      "She's known about this move for about three weeks now. I've been over several times to help her pack (her house is kept at almost hoarder levels of trash, which I've also helped clean or outright cleaned myself for her in the past).  Every time I've gone over, we pack for about an hour and then she says she's done. I try to encourage her to let us keep going but she insists that \"the rest is furniture\". Her family has also been over to help, so she isn't doing this alone.  Tonight she picks up the truck to start loading for tomorrow's move. I've been sick as a dog (fever, sinus stuff, chills, etc). Missed work yesterday for it and left work early today for it. My kid is now also sick. She still expects me to come help her finish packing tonight, and make the hour and a half (one way) drive tomorrow to help unload the truck.   So WIBTA if I don't help?\n",
      "Hi guys,  Unsure what to do here - But here's some context.  Recently, in my circle of friends, I had a falling out, and haven't been replying to anyone. I also recently moved out.  One of my friends who is a local police officer (this is not the USA) - Came by my house one day and insisted we talk this out, but I hadn't given anyone my address. He looked up my name using his police database or something to find my address and come visit me (not while he's on the clock obviously).   WIBTA if I report him? I didn't give anyone my address for a reason and I'm pissed that everyone now knows where I live.\n",
      "Because I (29f) worked in fast food/restaurants during high school and early adulthood, I put in my best effort to be courteous to the worker. Usually, when I'm with friends or family and we have a split order (they pay for their food, I pay for mine) I make sure we go inside instead of drive thru to avoid extra hassle for them.  I was out with my friend (24f) when we decided to stop for dinner. We check the times to make sure the lobby is still open. Online it says it is. We get there and only drive thru is open.   In the past my family has ordered separate orders  through drive thru, so while I don't like it, I know we can do it.  Nope! We get to the order box and apologize right away saying we needed separate orders. Immediately they say they can't do that. I'm a little taken back and but am still polite and just ask if they changed that due to everything going on. No reply, until a minute later when they yell out are you going to order. They tell us we can either get one order now and pull back around for the second, or put them on the same order. Seeing as 6 cars are now behind us my friend just pays for us.  At the window I ask the cashier when did the policy change. She tell me a while ago, pretty shortly, and they have their reasons. I'll admit I'm a little confused and ask what those reasons were. She snaps and says just for safety and slams the window. She throws us are food and tells me I don't need to badger them on a policy they have no control over. My friend and I left in shock.  Now I'm feeling like a Karen. Was I over the line?\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have had an ongoing discussion that we can't seem to see eye to eye on. I will preface this by saying I encourage him to go out with his friends or to his family, I'm perfectly fine with him going alone or staying however long it takes.   My problem is he keeps telling me he'll do one thing and ends up changing plans and staying hours longer without even a short text. I don't ask for details, but we live together and if it takes 2 hours more I'd like to be given a \"I'll be back 2 hours later\". To me it's just basic courtesy.  Aita asking for brief updates if plans change ? He agreed to do so in the past but didn't keep his word.\n",
      "I have been engaged to my boyfriend Max for 2 years and we have been dating for 6. Both are child free. My nephew Sam is 5 and my SIL son Dave is 5.5. None of them have been diagnosed with any mental issues (people love jumping to conclusions). I have Adhd diagnosed.  Most of the time I'm working from home, I'm a part of the team that develops games and into gaming myself. Because of this I have a pretty powerful gaming PC that is also suitable for doing editing. PC is located in our gaming room in the house where we also have consoles.  I'm very particular about people who are allowed in the room and can use the consoles or the PC. Apart from my bf, I have some friends and my nephew who are allowed in the room, as they behave calm and don't destroy things or rage quit, which results in breaking some of the equipment.  Over the bank holiday we were hosting a family dinner, my sister and my SIL were both invited and came with their kids. After the dinner the kids were getting bored as we don't really have a lot of space for them to run around and play, so my nephew Sam has asked if he can go to the gaming room and play Spyro. I said yes. Dave decided to join Sam which I had no issues with.  About 20 minutes later Dave comes back and starts moaning that he wants to play too and Spyro is too boring. He asks if he can play on PC or the consoles and I say no. I have been at my SIL house multiple times and unlike Sam Dave is prone to rage quitting and just in general really destructive kid, who I've seen breaking things when he gets annoyed. Sam on another hand would just put the controller down and leave to calm down. He would also let you know when he is done and doesn't throw any tantrums if asked to quit the game because it is time to leave or do something else.  Dave started to have a meltdown and my SIL accused me of playing favourites. Here where I might be an asshole. I have told her that Sam is my nephew who I see several times a week and I know how he handles things. I have told her that I have seen Dave handling things and the last time I gave him something he broke it within an hour. I have also said that Dave seems to be interested in a bit more adult games and neither me or my sister believe they are appropriate for Sam due to his age.  My SIL called me an asshole for \"picking favourites\" and left shortly after. My fiancé doesn't think I'm an ass here, however some of my in laws believe I was too harsh and should have allowed Dave to play.  Edit: before someone asks Dave didn't want to play games Sam was playing/allowed to play. Dave wanted to play things like call of duty, gta, resident evil, saints row, watch dogs which are all mostly shooters and are too violent and adult for a child especially his age. His older sister was enjoying watching Sam play as she doesn't really like to play games but likes watching others to play them. And Sam was showing/explaining her the ropes. So essentially part of the issue was with Dave saying he doesn't want to play or watch kid friendly games which he originally was OK with because he saw \"fancier\" games which he was not allowed.\n",
      "My (25f) dad (56m) has a lot of health problems (cancer survivor, diabetic, hypertension, liver disease, chronic stress) which definitely put him in a high risk category. He's also in a lot of medical debt and business debt for his family owned business. He's been working throughout the entire pandemic. Unfortunately, his income bracket, despite being in 6 figure debt places him just outside the range of what would be eligible for a healthcare subsidy. So he decided not to enroll.  I completely freaked out. My dad is experiencing really prominent signs of diabetic neuropathy, doesn't exercise, sleeps like 3 hours a night, works 14 hours a day, and every time I see him, I see a medical emergency just waiting to happen.  Since I help him with his finances, I know basically all his info. So I enrolled in a Marketplace plan for him, which I'm more than happy to pay for myself. Well, after I told him this, he got super angry, told me he doesn't need my help, and that he knows what he's doing. I disagree. If he got covid, he would basically be completely screwed, medically and financially, if he didn't have insurance. Then he started going off on me for \"stealing his identity\" even though he had initially given me permission to make an account to browse for options. On the other hand, he hasn't asked me to delete it yet, but he's still pretty angry at me.   I talked to my sister who lives with him and called me to let me know dad felt humiliated that his daughter didn't trust him or think he could take care of himself. I do! But when he had cancer, it destroyed him financially, and I'm not willing to let that happen again. AITA for \"stealing\" his identity, enrolling him in healthcare (which I'm paying for), and making him feel like I don't trust him to take care of himself?\n",
      "Every year when winter comes around and it snows (I live in Canada) my mom will get me to shovel the walkway leading up to the door which is fine I can do that. However every year she gets frustrated when I leave tiny patches of snow on the walkway like she needs me to scrape it to 100% doneness. Also she expects me to get the whole width of the walkway. The way I scoop is I just use my shoceks width, its wide enough to walk though so it's good enough for me. She insists that I shovel the full width though which I think is totally unnecessary, especially when its gonna be back next morning. To me it just sounds like extra work woty no benefits so typically I'll just not do it amd explain to her its basically the same. AITA\n",
      "My brother (9) is a fan of 6ix9ine doesn't care that he snitched, me on the other hand I don't respect no snitches I don't care I don't play that shit. So today my brother goes up to our mom and shows her the picture he had drawn and she loves it because thats what all moms do when their kid draws a picture and she posts it onto her instagram. So I was walking in the hallway and I see it on his bedroom floor, my brother usually has a bunch of scrap drawings laying around in his room and I usually just pick them up and put them in his trash so I pick up his scraps which I didn't know were his drawings and put them in his trash. A few minutes later he asked me if I seen his drawing and I told him I thought they were scraps and put them in his trash. He freaked out and said \"DUDE I HAVE FOOD IN MY TRASH MY DRAWING MIGHT BE RUINED\" and I said \"Why would you want a drawing of a rat\" and he said he didn't care that he snitched and that he was upset at me for doing what I did. I said \"Sorry but why would you support snitching\" and he said \"You would snitch if you were 6ix9ine so shut up\". I told him to stfu and get out my room, my mom ran upstairs and yelled at me for what I did and took my xbox. I understand that maybe I was a little rude but bruh AITA?\n",
      "My phone broke earlier this month and they had an extra phone which had problems connecting with the Wi-Fi that they gave me, i used to sleep in my grandmas room because there is only 3 bedrooms and 2 of those rooms are for my older sisters. I decided to sleep in the living room corner, there is 1 stand fan that my brother uses (he sleeps in the other corner) so I asked my grandma to use her small charging fan, it's been  2 weeks or so and i got used to sleeping on the floor and one day there was a power outage, my grandma asked for the small fan so I went to look for it and i saw it being used by my sister, there we're no more juice so I tried charging it with my ear pod case but i forgot to charge it, so it was 1 full day without electricity and it was a hot day and grandmas are sensitive to heat, my brother got mad at me for not charging the fan (which I did) and he decided I can't use it anymore even tho I have my grandma's permission to use it (he and my cousins paid for it as a birthday gift, it's been almost a year since it was given), so I swore at my brother of how much of a bitch he is. He got mad and decided to tell my dad without telling the full story (my dad believes in my brother so much the anything I say is all fake to him) so am I the ass whole for swearing?  I'm 14 and he's 18, they won't allow me to sleep on the couch because they are worried I might break it, there is no other fans in the house.\n",
      "Me and 3 other of my friends planned to go to the movies this Tuesday.  We had specifically did it on Saturday to make sure our schedules were free, and all of us were besides 1. He was already traveling so he couldn’t make it. I was extremely excited, thinking we were gonna hang out, as we all haven’t hung out as a trio in ages. But, one of my friends was already avoiding it and wasn’t giving us a clear answer on whether or not she was going to go or not, and each and every time we asked she’d change the subject or something like that. But at the end of the day, she confirmed she was going.  Now, Tuesday comes and we’re all excited getting and getting ready early and everything. My friend tells my friend(let’s call her M) M to start getting ready early because she’s a little slower than us when getting ready, and she wants to act clueless. Saying, “wait what?” “It’s Tuesday??”. We both didn’t think nothing of it, just shrugged it off thinking she was just being forgetful, as she always has.  But it comes later in the day, like 12-ish, a couple of hours before the movie, and she goes “I don’t think I can make it, I don’t like the way I’m feeling”. and we were both upset because she’s the one who really suggested it and made the plan in the first place. And she goes “I can’t go, I gotta go to the doctor.” and we were okay with that because if you have to go to the hospital then go, we can just go another time, right? Yeah, no way. She didn’t have to go to the doctor or nothing, she just didn’t feel like going for whatever reason. We didn’t even find this out through her, we found it out through our other friend who couldn’t make it.  We both got considerably pissed because if she just didn’t want to go she could’ve said that expect she lied to both of us and made up a really sad excuse on why. We started grilling her for it saying things like “you didn’t have to lie” and things like that. She told it was for personal problems and wanted to avoid something but never told us that beforehand. We would’ve understood the personal problems and I tried to explain that to her, as my other friend did. And she was saying things like “it’s not that serious” “you have each other” and yeah we did, but we planned this all together. She canceled out a few hours and suddenly had issues and stuff the day it was happening? We didn’t really believe, but we just dropped it because if she didn’t wanna tell us the truth, simple as that. Of course we were still upset at her lying but it wasn’t whatever.  Now, here goes like an entire hour later and I guess she felt bad for lying and said something along the lines like “if I go will you guys stop saying I’m lying?” as if we were still on the topic, we were talking about totally different things and she just brought it up out of nowhere.  We were both really confused and I said nobody is forcing her to go, because if she doesn’t want to go nobody can make her really. At the end of the day, we just went without her and had a lot of fun.  So, AITA for blowing up on her???  Edit: I’d like to mention her household life is completely fine besides a couple of arguments with her mom, she has no previous cases of anxiety nor depression and hasn’t been diagnosed recently either. She was also going to the doctor because she managed to sallow a piece of plastic, although she never went.\n",
      "So, my band broke up a few months ago, due to our singer/guitarist moving, and we've just recently begun to regroup. We are currently out of a singer, but I was very optimistic about this, since we are all talented guys IMO. Enter \"Jacky\". I've played with Jacky before. He's a nice dude, but with social disabilities and with no ability to hold a tune. As I said, nice guy, but a godawful singer, and an even worse performer.  He saw our final big show, and has been nagging us all summer to be his BACKING BAND (LMFAO). My bandmates, being much nicer guys than I am eventually gave in and just added him to our band group.  I'm seething over this, since A) having him as a singer will unilaterally ruin whatever tiny chance we have of making anything of this, and B) - having known the guy for 2 years, even just talking non-band related stuff is mentally exhausting, since he has social difficulties, and is generally a really tactless, difficult guy to speak with.  I REALLY don't wanna be a dick, but I'm out if they let him in. I only have so much energy, and given that I've played with him before, having him as a singer means my faith in this band would be literally zero.   WIBTA  for giving them an ultimatum:  Either get rid of this guy before he gets to nestled in, or I (the only guy with songwriting experience) walk, which honestly likely means breaking up the band entirely in the long run.  I love these guys, and I don't want a promising thing end up basically stillborn, so AITA here?\n",
      "Ok so, the situation is this: I was driving home tonight, and arrived home roughly around 8PM, and leave my bike idling for approximately 30 seconds with my lights on so I can actually see where I am parking (tricky gravel parking space with a concrete slab for the kickstand)  Shortly after I turn my bike off and put away my keys; the next door neighbour comes out and moans at me for having my bike on, and proceeds to slam her door.   So this is my question: AITA?   Edit: forgot to mention that she has kids\n",
      "I have a mole on my back that’s been there as long as I can remember. My wife recently has taken issue with it and is asking me to get it zapped.  You can’t see it when I’m wearing a shirt, so I don’t see what the issue is? I don’t want to go have something done on it for virtually no gain.  She getting mad saying this is one of those things you’re supposed to do for each other. I’m be never heard “remember, if your wife wants you to get a mole zapped, you should do it”.  AITA?  Edit: she’s not worried about cancer\n",
      "Second time posting here so sorry for formatting and such.  Earlier today as I was getting off the bus I fell and fractured by ring finger in 2 spots. It was pretty bad break (my finger looked like a cartoon lightning bolt and was bleeding; it turned out to be a green stick and comminuted fracture I believe). My mom was called and as we were leaving she very cheerily informed me that I wouldn’t be able to visit the doctors for another 3 and a half hours. She said she had a tennis match to go and that she couldn’t cancel as that would mean forfeiting the game. She laughed like it was just a light hearted joke, but I realized it wasn’t when she pulled into our neighborhood. Now, I’m no stranger to broken bones so my pain tolerance is pretty high, but at this point I was clutching my hand and fighting off tears. I blew up. I started telling her how selfish it was to let me sit at home with a broken finger so she could indulge in a hobby. I’ll admit I was pretty harsh, but my mind was foggy from pain and anger. She said I didn’t understand and that I was entitled. She tried calling my dad to take me but he was at work. He told her off in a lot nicer way than I did. On the way to the urgent care center she called all of her friends and began bitching about being the victim for being told off by her “moody daughter.” Her friends took her side. She thinks she’s entitled to an apology. I don’t think I  (or my father) owe her an apology. AITA for blowing up on her and refusing to apologize?  For extra info: I’m in high school but can’t drive myself. Even if I could, I knew I’d be getting a cast so I would have needed someone to drive me home. The break happened at school so no friends of mine could have taken me instead.  TLDR; Broke my finger and blew up on my mom after she refused to take me to an urgent care center. She thinks I should apologize\n",
      "Obligatory this is my first post, Blah blah blah.  I (20 Nonbinary) am the creator of a groupme chat with about 200 students in it. I have mod Privileges so I can add or remove people, yadda yadda.   In the group description, I put a warning for people not to cheat: as the groupchat owner, I can be held responsible for others cheating, I know there’s at least 1 TA(Teacher’s assistant)in the chat, and I also dont want there to be 200 students who fail and get marks on their records bc of me/my groupchat.  We had a test, and I messgaed the group to remind them not to cheat and that I would remove people if they did. Sure enough, some people get to sending pictures and answering questions for others. I removed two students and that was it. The groupme does, however, send a message to EVERYONE that I removed them. I didn’t want to make it a huge deal, I sent another reminder about cheating and the fact that there is a TA in the chat, and wanted to leave it there.   Some kids started saying I handled it wrong, some started defending me, and some insults were thrown around. I dont mind if they’re mad at me, but it does rub me the wrong way that they started insulting othepeople for agreeing with me.   I sent another message saying that they were welcome to message me if they were upset with me, but to please leave other students alone. Now they’re all saying I’m “Immature and could have handled it better, I’m overreacting etc”.   I think giving them a heads up that I wasn’t going to let them put others students at risk, and that they would be removed was fair.  I still feel a little guilty, and wonder if I shouldn’t have done or said anything at all.  AITA?\n",
      "typical small town live auction. they have tons of crap. so they pull out two rolling tables. there are 5 jbl speakers (e series) on one table, and a jbl subwoofer on the other table. they are directly side by side. with tons of other trinkets on the tables. the auction is announced that the jbl speakers will be sold as one lot. there was a yamaha amp on the table and the auction dude says it's not included in the bid price. it's very normal to place your bid and then you get your choice of how many items at that price you want to take from the table. so I bid on the speakers, $400 for the lot. and they want me to take the speakers off the table. so I am getting the speakers off the first table and bring them to my car, I go back to get the subwoofer and they sold it separately from the 5 surround speaker setup. I call manager over and he says the sub was on a different table and is not included in what i bid on because it came in with a different consigner. that's why it was on a separate table. I explained that I could not know that and what about the announcement that the jbl speakers would be sold as a lot. management says what would make me happy. I say cut the price for me by what the subwoofer sold for. owners wife, Karen steps in, says no. I can either bring the speakers back in and pay zero or pay the full bid price. subwoofer is in some other guys truck at this point. so I decided to bail on this sham I bring the speakers back. and Karen says I am banned for life for ever coming back to the auction house. AITA? what's the rule of separation on tables at live auctions?\n",
      "I’m sorry for how I write but English isn’t my first language. My parents are divorced and I’m (17f) living by my father(60m) since the whole COVID situation started. He works all day all the days and the house was pretty dirt so I started to clean and do everything. I was studying online and I couldn’t exit so spend two hours a day to put everything together wasn’t a big deal. The problem started when he get used to these and derogate to me all the responsibilities, like go to the grocery, ironing, take out the trash etc. and not having a car (in my country you cannot drive until 18) it was very difficult to do everything and it went worse when I returned at school in presence. Plus he’s a disaster, he came home with very dirty shoes and he walks whit these on wet floor or he threw dirty clothes everywhere, he doesn’ wash is own clothes, after eating he lets everything on the table so I would tidy up when I come home. We don’t speak often and I usually don’t tell him everything annoys me, also because he takes everything I say like an attack. On his side he works like 12 hr a day everyday, with no vacations or pauses, and he’s too tired to help. I don’t want to split the work, I just want that him doesn’t sabotage me in it. Last night we were at his girlfriend (they’re together for nearly 6 months) place to have dinner and the conversation went about houses and I told him that he needs a new one, later he was reproving me for not putting the washing out yesterday and I said joking that it’s time for him to start helping at home. He didn’t take it too well. Returning home he started yelling me about how I humiliated him, that he have to work, that if want do nothing I can just say that and he would “improvise” etc  We haven’t talked since this conversation and I didn’t say nothing during this road trip.  Upgrade: he just had an heart attack caused by emotional stress  Explaining: he has already pacemaker and defibrillator implants for an intervention of about two years ago, nowadays he’s very fragile. He stayed for some hours at the hospital and now he feels good\n",
      "I got my hotel and went to the elevator with some dude riding my ass the whole walk there and the door elevators were beginning to close because a big family was already in there going up. I was like ok I’ll let it close and get going before pressing the button so it doesn’t just open back up to a full elevator and waste everyone’s time.  The dude behind me that had been following me reaches around me, literally less than 3 seconds after the door closes, and presses the button and tells me “the button doesn’t press itself, buddy.” I explained to him that I wasn’t going to press it before they even got to leave the floor and that pressing the button isn’t going to make an elevator immediately appear (there’s only one elevator shaft). He didn’t even make eye contact while I was trying to explain myself and he just rolled his eyes.   Am I the asshole/dumb in this situation?\n",
      "For context, my oldest brother has a criminal history and had attacked people in the house often. He would get into screaming matches with my mom, which would escalate to where me and my other brother, not the one who was yelling, would fear for our lives, run to the farthest room, and lock the door. I usually had to grab a weapon for self defense.  My family lived like this for 15 years, because my older brother was three when he was adopted. We were all adopted from different family's, but my oldest brother was the first. He was always a troublemaker, but that was fine with me. He was still nice and a good brother to hang out with, but that changed when he started committing crimes.  I'm pretty sure his first crime was when he was in a yelling match with mom. It escalated to the point of the cops rushing our way to stop him. When they came in, my brother had a mental breakdown and was taken with the police to jail for a day when my mom bailed him out. He was arrested outside my house numerous times and was honestly a bad person. He would attack people at his school because they said something bad about him. He started buying used vapes and vaping in the house. He was diagnosed with anger issues and he also had a hard time in school.   In the end, I sided with my mom when she kicked him out of the house, but now I'm wondering if I am the AH.\n",
      "Some context here: I've (21M) been in a very on and off relationship with my gf (20F) for about 7 months. We've recently been back together for a couple months when we admitted to each other how strong our feelings were. In that time, we were very sexually active, and at the start I wanted to get her honesty on some things I was curious about and wanted to also be totally transparent back with her. I had a sneaking suspicion that she was lying about finishing in bed, and I asked her point blank if she was ever faking it with me. I prefaced that with some anecdotes as well to make her more comfortable with being honest - a previous partner of mine never was able to finish and made that very clear to me - and I let her know that her admitting that she was not finishing would not at all hurt my pride, and that she can and should just be totally honest with me for transparency and trust's sake. She replied by saying something along the lines of \"No, I don't fake it with you! I've faked it with guys before obviously, but I wouldn't do that with you. With an SO, it would be pointless to do that, and it wouldn't help to lie to you and not let you know if you're doing it right or not.\" I really appreciated that sentiment and took that to heart and appreciated her guiding us to work together on having a healthy sex life.  Fast forward to a couple days ago. We had sex and something felt extremely off about it, and it definitely seemed like she faked it. I asked her again point blank if she was faking it, and for about 5 minutes she awkwardly laughed, her face turned bright red, and she tried to avoid answering before finally revealing that she was actually lying the entire time. I got extremely sad and told her I was very disappointed and distraught - not about her faking it, but about her making that extremely crushing lie before that I believed to be a very heartfelt and honest statement from her when I asked her for some honesty. When pressing her on specifics to get more details about the lies, she ended up lying again about them in the moment and then walking back on it and admitting the truth (she said that one night where we tried together really hard to go for two times, and she finished once... nope, actually she didn't finish at all), which was pretty much the final straw for me, and I ended up leaving.  From this, I feel extremely torn over what to do. I was extremely convinced by her lie, and now I am frankly terrified of being intimate with her again for fear of her lying to me again and for fear of me not being enough to satisfy her. It's currently eating me alive and I feel like I should break it off with her, since my trust has gone to an all time low, and I now just feel completely broken. WIBTA if I break it off? Is she TA for doing the double lie? Am I overreacting and in turn, TA? Help me reddit!  ((posted from a burner account)) edited for wording!  EDIT2: I didn't actually break up with her yet! Tried to mention that with the WIBTA rather than the AITA. Still trying to figure out if breaking up with her would be the right call.\n",
      "My wife Ari was married back when we were only friends. And she and her husband Eric were trying to have a baby. They were unsuccessful and one day they approach me asking if I’d be willing to be a sperm donor for them. I agreed to it after some time to think because she was one of my closest friends and wanted to help them out. We talked about my role being the fun uncle type and being there for important stuff. She got pregnant and had my son John. She and Eric separated when John was a few months old but he was still involved. But when he was 7 months old Eric passed away. Ari struggled a lot as a single mom and so I wanted to help her out more.  Slowly little by little I got to be more involved helping take care of him. 4 years later I fell in love with Ari and we pursued a romantic relationship. Eric’s family was still involved in John’s life and they were outraged when they found out about us. His sister in particular (who’s like 35 btw), started spreading rumors that we were having an affair when she got pregnant with John and “tricked” Eric into letting me be a sperm donor to cover it up. It was pretty wild. They just saw it as Ari committing a massive betrayal to Eric’s memory starting a relationship with the biological father of their child even though they were already going to divorce. We had to cut it off for a while. Then we got married and have another baby on the way. Last year Eric’s family wanted to come around again to see John (7).   We talked it over and agreed to it. It mattered to us that he still get to have his grandparents around so we hoped it would work out. Due to covid we only saw them a handful of times but they were invited to our pool party. Some time during the party I heard some arguing and my wife went back into our house crying. I took them into the house and asked ex MIL what happened. She looked furious. So the topic of John’s school came up. Ex MIL was trying to convince Ari to send John to the same school Eric did and they had a disagreement.  This led to the topic of Eric being brought up and how “Ari keeps finding more ways to dishonor his memory.” Knowing her I’m sure it was more she said to make Ari that upset. I was so mad that I told them they needed to leave right now. They left through the front so party guests in the back wouldn’t see but they were still furious at being kicked out. And really think I was an asshole for making them leave over a disagreement like that.   I’m just not happy with them at all and neither is Ari. But still wonder if I was an asshole for my reaction.\n",
      "This is going to be a bit of a whirlwind, but I will try and make it as quick as possible..  December 2018, I left my husband for a plethora of reasons that were overdue by about 3 years.  We have 2 children together, a 5 year old and a 2 year old.  I actually left him for another woman, who I somehow fell in love with.  This woman has 2 children also, and also left her husband for me.  In March 2019 her and I moved in together.  Now, she has a small SUV and I had a Chevy Traverse, that was in absolute terrible shape.  I kept dumping a ton of money into it.  I think over the course of 4 months I dumped about $3000 into it and the last time I got it back from the mechanic I drove it for about a week and my radiator went.  I was just completely done with this car.  I told my girlfriend I was going to trade it in for a new car to just stop dumping money into the Traverse.  She was obviously fine with it but asked if I was going to get another 7 seater so we can fit us and our 4 kids into one car when we go places together.  Now here is the thing, I only had the Traverse because I got a really good deal on it a few years back.  I absolutely hated the car.  I hated how big it was and I hated having to park in different places in parking lots because I needed more room to back up in it.  I hated everything about it.  So, I did not want another large car.  The other thing is, my credit is less than stellar so I knew getting approved for a car loan would be pretty difficult.  I looked around and went to a few car dealers and ended up getting approved finally at a Jeep dealer, so I got a nice 2019 Jeep Compass for a hefty monthly payment.  But who cares, at least I am done dumping money into a car that is worthless.  &#x200B;  Now, my girlfriend was absolutely pissed off that I did this.  She said I had no intentions on moving forward with her because of the car that I bought and I should have bought another 7 seater truck to fit all of us for the maybe 1-2x a month that we all go out together.  I told her we could literally just take 2 cars if we have to, to go to the next town over which is probably the furthest we drive.. and if we wanted to go somewhere else further we could just rent a car for a weekend or whatever.  &#x200B;  I told her I didn't think it was fair that I should have to pay $400+ a month for a car that I absolutely hate driving just so we can all fit in the car once in a while.  She disagreed and told me I was selfish.  I don't disagree that it was a selfish decision somewhat, but why can't it be?  I have to pay for it and drive it everyday.  Let me know if I'm the asshole.  &#x200B;  Edit since people asked:  I told her no when she asked if I was going to get a 7 seater because I hated driving the larger car.\n",
      "I'm 20 so I'm not sure if this is something I'll just have to deal with now that I'm an adult or what.   The last few family gatherings my aunt has summoned all the women to the kitchen to help with food and setting the table and whatever.  I have no issues with helping,  usually I get to those things early to help with any set up type stuff.   Thing is after I'm finished with my tasks I'm basically forced to stay in there and talk about things that I don't find interesting and have nothing to contribute to the conversation.   Like around Christmas it was where everyone was vacationing with their bf/husband.  Yawn. My aunt asked if I was going anywhere and when I said no it felt really awkward.  I'm putting myself through college, I can't exactly fly to Aspen for a week. I felt boring thought because I didn't have anything to  add.  Meanwhile before I came in the kitchen I had been talking to my uncle about football. Which was a way more interesting conversation to me.   Then between Christmas and Easter my cousin got engaged to his fiancè. So kitchen conversations on Easter were all about the about the proposal and their new place. I kept trying to go back in the living room but my aunt said stuff like  \"oh don't you wanna hear about how he proposed?\" Or \"you're  gonna love this part\" So I felt like I had to stay.   My grandparents had a get together last weekend.  I did my tasks and my cousins fiancé was talking about wedding planning so I started heading outside.  My aunt said \"where are you going?\" I lied and said I had to get my soda from outside,  then I just stayed out there until dinner and talked to my cousin and uncle.   Nobody said anything Saturday but apparently my aunt said something to my dad about it between then and yesterday. That  \"it wasn't very nice for me to leave mid conversation \" and something like she feels like I don't want to spend time with them.   I told my dad that I have nothing to add to the conversation and I'm bored the entire time. I said I'm still being helpful but don't understand why I should be forced to just stand there.  My dad said \"well sometimes with family you have to stay and listen to things they're interested in to show you care\" then he said I can't just leave because it's rude.   I was in no way involved in the conversation though.  I just happened to be in the room. I don't think it's fair for me to have to stand there and listen to them discuss dresses and flowers when I could be talking about baseball, school, work, etc.   My aunt always controls the conversation too by bringing up certain subjects.  If someone tries to change it she just circles back to whatever she wants to talk about. So it's not like I can just bring up school or something.  She also expects all the women to do clean up after the meal, so unless I sneak away I'm stuck there pretty much the whole time. It's to the point that if I HAVE to be in the kitchen,  I just won't go to those things anymore.  AITA for sneaking away?\n",
      "So I (21F) work in a technical lab running reliability tests on various products that the company sells. We run 2 types of tests on every pen (we call them that but they aren't actually pens) and have to record all the data and results in various spreadsheets. I have been working in this lab for almost a year, and there are only about 10 people in this lab, 4 of whom are in the testing area with me, and only 2 of us are females. We all tend to get along really well and have formed a sort of friendship among our group, in fact, the other female (26) in the group and I are very close friends now.  Well, about 5 weeks ago we got a new hire (19M). I was assigned to be his trainer, and at first, it was great. He was quick to pick up on stuff and is pretty efficient when he is working. But, I have been having a lot of issues with him for the past 3 weeks now. He will do a single test (maybe about 20 minutes of work) say \"well that was a hassle\" and then just sit on his phone the rest of the shift and complain about our other coworker (he never has had to deal with them, just heard us complain about some harassment a few times) or try to get my other F coworker and I to also stop working to \"entertain\" him or something, which she usually ends up doing, leaving me to try and get all the tests for that day done on my own. He has also taken to sitting and watching me, telling me how I should \"just be more productive and smarter like he is\" and I would do better at my job. I have been politely ignoring him when he makes comments, and when he tells me his newest \"hack\" for being more productive I just explain to him why that won't work because of the specific testing criteria we have to follow.  I have talked to our supervisors and HR and anyone else I am able to, but no one really cares enough to do anything about it because the rest of us still get enough done to keep the lab afloat.  Well, last night I hit my breaking point. He came in and sat on a chair for 2 hours before coming over to a testing station. He then proceeded to not do any tests and just critique me on how I'm not nearly productive enough and how he is so much better at this job than I am. I was fed up so I, while still running the tests, cut him off and said \"I would ask you to refrain from trying to tell me how to do my job unless you actually want to try doing yours for once.\" and just left it at that. He left me alone the rest of the night and actually did some of the small tests.  Well, when I got in the car with my F coworker (we carpool since we live really close to each other) she got upset saying I embarrassed her in front of her crush and that I was way out of line and should have just laughed it off like she does.  I didn't think I did anything wrong, and I did my best to still be polite despite wanting to just slap this dude at that point, but idk now, should I just have kept quiet and ignored him?  Edit: Not really applicable, but with this and a few other issues I have with the company I am going to be quitting as soon as I can get a full-time nannying position (I am well on my way to getting one soon, yay). I talked to some people high up in the company the one I am in is contracted with and asked for advice on what I should do, They advised me to, as soon as I quit send all the documentation of all the sexual harassment, the issues the coworkers have caused, every safety violation, and every time they have punished me or my other (good) coworkers for reporting anything, and everything else on the long list I already have, to the company that the one I am in is contracted with. The company it is contracted with would NEVER let any of these things slide, and the people I talked to and I think they would be VERY interested in hearing the things that have been hidden from them.\n",
      "Now growing up my brother (H) was a spoiled brat. (Hes about 4 years younger than me).  He used to always throw tantrums when he couldn't get his way, demand the most expensive things, ignore any of his assigned chores and even fight with me and our parents whenever things didn't go in his favor.  My parents tried their hardest to handle him but H never really got better and as for my relationship I'll explain it in a moment.  (Before anyone suggests it he doesnt have any sort of mental issues and is popular with friends and coworkers.)   My relationship with him is basically no content. After a massive falling out we had that led to me leaving home for a few days to crash by my uncle because I didnt even want to be near him.  My uncle has always been something of a rock to me so I've always confided in my problems to him whenever I had any so he was very aware of my H's behavior. After that fight the only advice he had to give to me was \"if it's this hard on you maybe just shouldnt deal with him until he changes his attitude\".  So that's what I did. I went no contact with him until I went to college despite living in the same house.   I came back from college and he was actually worse. He would buy food and hide it under his bed which would attract bugs, he would still be neglecting any of his household chores and somehow.. despite being 19 now he would sometimes just not flush the toilet after taking a dump.   To make matters worse his fights with our parents got even worse and I later learned that most of the family distanced themselves from him because his toxic behavior was affecting them as well. They would still be respectful around him when he was around but they stayed limited contact outside of family gatherings.  One night a fight with my mom got so out of hand I had to intervene because they were yelling so loud our neighbors could hear it.  Once I stepped in he exploded and somehow I guess everything he had bottled up came out. He started spewing about how he was the least favorite child and how nobody ever cared about him and he lashed out because I got all the nice things and he never got anything.   I got so angry I explode back \"You are the least favorite. not just child but family member. How do you expect to be treated nicely when you dont treat anybody well. You've lied to the entire family. Treated all of them and crap and you're 19 now and you cant even flush the toilet. You havent grown at all since you were 10. You think you dont deserve this kind of treatment? Your favorite uncle is the one who told me not to talk to you until you grow up. You still havent grown up. And until you stop acting like a jerk everyone will treat you as one. I cant understand how you think you can demand respect when you cant even flush a toilet.\"  H went silent and simply left the house.   My mom told me off right after saying I shouldnt have told him that about our other family members and I should apologize.   AITA?\n",
      "Background: I'm 15, live in Montreal Quebec Canada, but my family is French and not French Canadian. We moved here over 11 years ago. Ever since we've been here my father has been critical of the French-Canadian accent and their way to speak.  For as long as I can remember, whenever I made and still make any oral mistake in french my father would always tell me in an obnoxious way something along the lines of \" Il te faut des cours de francais\" which roughly translate to \"You need French classes\", this would and still happen to me for small mistakes which would be the equivalent of me SAYING \"anyways\" instead of \"anyway\". He's always blamed my sub-par french (to his eyes) on the fact that the French-Canadien education system is worse than the French one.  Since the day I turned 15 I started working at my local grocery store and work 20hrs shifts after school. Since the COVID situation, I worked 40hr shifts for the past couple of months, moving departments where I am most needed. I've also been putting most of my money into a high-interest saving accounts, I've been doing this with the hope of moving out at 17. Because of this, I've realized that his usual comments of getting french classes have evolved to \"why don't you pay yourself french classes with all that money\".  A couple of months ago I told him how much I dislike his comments and asked him to stop, he ignored my request and continued. Well today coming home I had a decent day at work and was looking forward to speaking with my parents, I then made a small oral mistake and ignored it, a couple seconds later my father started saying his usual phrase and I then cut him off and told him \"tais- toi\" multiples times (it's a nicer way to say shut up), he looked at me, purposefully ignored me and finished his phrase. Afterward, I yelled at him and he then told me to basically fuck off  My goal was to move out at 17 if I had 10k saved up, I'm now at 7k (thanks to the extra hours due to COVID) and have been considering moving out earlier (around 16) because I have this type of interaction constantly with my father and it's causing me to be extremely unhappy, did I overreact and was I TA\n",
      "there’s a tldr at the bottom if you don’t want to read all of this. advice is appriciated.  here it goes, i’m 15 and i last spoke to my dad when i was 9. there was a restraining order on my dad , i’m not even sure why there was one. my mom would always shove words in my mouth and tell me things that weren’t real and would result in me having an anxiety attack because i was scared to go over. but when i would go over, i would have an amazing time with everyone in the household. yes, a few traumatic events happened there but there have been many more at my moms house thst have impacted me more.  So now onto what’s happening now. i’ve been wanting to contact my dad because i don’t really know anything about him. everything my mom tells me about him/ the situation is very one sided and if i ever say anything about how it wasn’t right on her part, i get yelled at. my mom and i fight a lot and she threatens to kick me out, throw away everything in my room (burning it, selling it etc) and telling me she would send me off to my dads house. this has been happening since i was 10. there’s a lot more that goes on/ happens here, but now onto the next part. i’ve been wanting to talk to my dad, as said before. well, he messaged me. i unblocked him on facebook a few months ago in hope he could somehow talk to me so i wouldn’t get in trouble for initiating the conversation, and i wasn’t even sure if there was the restraining order still. i am still very shocked about him messaging me. i just know if i tell my mom , she will flip out and take my things away, including my few healthy coping mechanisms thst help me. am i an asshole for talking to my dad? i also came here for advice because, you know, i’m 15 and don’t really know how to speak to her about it because everything i have ever come to her about she ends up making situation worse/yelling at me. (and no, when i say yelling i mean she is screaming at me to the point i am about to pass out from an anxiety attack)he mentioned wanting me to come visit for christmas, and a bunch of things but my mom would never let me. my mom has always said that “he doesn’t care , he hasn’t even reached out to you” things like that. i just really need advice on how to talk to my mom about this. and how to initiate the conversation?  TLDR my dad messaged me and i haven’t spoke to him  since i was 9(15currently) and i would like to speak to him, but am in fear of how mother would react. (mother is very questionable , screaming /taking things away and throwing them in burn barrel, threatening to sell etc) advice on the situation is very much appreciated:)\n",
      "I know the title already sounds terrible, but please hear me out. I have a 3 months old kitten and he's been mine for a month or so. Two days ago my aunt called me and told me her friend had a 5-month old shih tzu puppy she wanted to give away. She also has two cats, one is terrified of the puppy and one is always super angry at the puppy, that's why she needed to rehome the puppy.  My aunt asked me if I think my kitten can get along with the puppy. And to be honest I didn't know, my kitten was a feral and sure, he may be sweet around me and even strangers, but I didn't know how he might react to a dog. At first I told my aunt no, I couldn't take the dog. My boyfriend and mom (I live with my parents) also said no because they were afraid taking a dog might stress me out.  But then a few hours later, my mom called me and told me she didn't have the heart to leave the puppy in that predicament and said that maybe we could take him in. My dad was also happy at the prospect of my kitten gaining a friend. Tbh, I was excited too, I thought it'd be nice for Cookie, my kitten, to have a friend.  Besides, my aunt told me that the dog was super small, potty trained, and already vaccinated. The previous owner also agreed to give me the puppy's leftover food. All I had to do was take him.  Fast forward two days later (today), it's the first time I see the puppy and it's also the day I take him home. I took the dog and I was super happy, he was sweet when I carried him home. But then, I found out that he wasn't vaccinated and he wasn't potty trained at all. He made a mess everywhere. It seems that he was kind of neglected too, the fur around his face is overgrown, obstructing his eyes. There were fleas all over him too, to the point whre his skin is covered with red bite marks. My boyfriend and I tried our best removing them but there was simply too many. My kitten peeked at him from the top of the stairs and hissed. This sent the puppy into a frenzy, barking nonstop and trying to charge at my kitten.  To be honest, I don't know if I can keep the puppy. The potty training part can be worked on, but my mom and I are miffed about it. Maybe he was just trying to get used to the place but I don't know if the issue is gonna get better. And with the fleas and his slight hostility toward the kitten, I don't know if I can put up with that. I value my kitten's safety and happiness above all.  But then again, it's only been a few hours and the puppy seems excited and happy with me. He wags his tail and follows me around. He even waits for me at the stairs when I go upstairs. I don't have the heart to let him go, but I know I can't give him the love and attention he deserves.  My mother and I texted my aunt about this. We asked her to help us find someone who could take care of the puppy. She was angry, telling me she felt bad for the dog and I had to be more patient. She also insinuated that I was a bad person, abandoning the dog when he's already so happy with me. I understand I can't expect him to get along with my kitten instantly, but I fear for my kitten's safety. Also, again it's only been a couple of hours, do you think the dog is already too attached to me?  So at the end, my aunt told me she might contact an acquaintance to pick up the puppy tomorrow. I feel super guilty, both to my kitten and the puppy. I know it was my own mistake saying yes and taking the puppy in the first place, I just don't think I could give the dog the love it deserves. He's only known me for a couple of hours, so will he be depressed if I rehome him? AITA?\n",
      "This happened around 6 years ago now but it still pops up in my head every now and then. Back when i was in grade 6 we had a group assignment where we had to film a video about the topic, and in my group i was the \"cameraman\".   We filmed it on a school laptop and because i was the one who was using it, we agreed that i would be the one to return it to the library, which was on the other side of the school, after the period was over.   One day one of my group members decided to take the laptop from me and become the cameraman. I got quite mad about that because i had no other role in the project so they were basically forcing me out, however no one else in the group thought so.  I told them that id like to be able to contribute and that since he had taken over as the cameraman I'd like to take his part on the video bit at that point they laughed at me, assuming i was joking.   After that i got furious and told them \"since hes the one using the laptop he can return it\" and left. Turns out that he didnt bring it back and just left it on the ground because they all thought I'd come back and return it.  After that day everyone in the group was banned from using the schools laptops for the rest of they year and everyone blamed me for it.  AITA?\n",
      "I have a friend that just had surgery. She called me because she wanted visitors while she was recovering. Me and a mutual friend (who we know is a narcotic addict in recovery) were invited over at the same time. While we were visiting, she left her prescriptions sitting right on the bathroom sink. After the visit, I got a call from the person who had surgery absolutley furious that some of her pills were missing. I asked her how she know, and she said that she counted them right before she set them on the table to see if this other friend would steal from her. I went off on her for doing that when we knew about this other girl's addiction, and blamed her for causing the other girl to relapse. (The girl ended up confessing and breaking down about it later that night). The one who had the surgery felt \"betrayed\" and I didn't have the heart to tell the other girl that those were put there in plain sight of her to see how she'd react. (FYI, I didn't use the bathroom, so I didn't know they were there, otherwise I would have said something during the visit.)\n",
      "My BIL and SIL were going camping with their kids and invited my 8 year old son to join them. I was a little hesitant because we have very different parenting styles, but i decided to let him go. He was excited and then SIL casually mentioned that she had invited MIL and her new boyfriend. I have two major issues with this.  First of all they are cheaters. They were both married when they met and they had an affair, decided they were \"in love\" and then dragged it out so they could hide assets, gather info on their spouses, and screw them in the divorce. MIL admitted to me that she transferred her business to her father so that her ex couldn't get any of it. In her defense he was an alcoholic and he majorly sucks, but I don't know anything about her new boyfriend's wife.   Second, i googled her new boyfriend because I'm a little bit of a helicopter parent and I google anyone who is going to be around my son. He is a mega successful attorney, the type that likes to screw people for money. One of the first articles that came up about him was him getting someone clearly guilty off of the hook. I understand it is his job, but i don't respect it.  I said my son can't go if they are going. BIL called me exhausting and my son is pissed, but i don't want him around gross people.\n",
      "My daughter is 3, and sometimes gets scared I’ll stop loving her when she does something bad(for no good reason mind you, I make sure she always knows why I’m upset, and that I’m mad at her actions, not her). Today she bumped a glass off the table and started crying.  She asked if I still love her and I said “I love you more than anything” and gave her a kiss. My wife was watching and stormed off. I made sure my daughter was fine and cleaned up the glass and went to go see what was going on.   My wife was crying and calling me an asshole who doesn’t love her (I guess I have 2 irrational 3 years olds now). I said of course I love her and asked why she was wigging out.  She said that because I said the above phrase to my daughter, it meant she didn’t mean as much to me. Is this really something I’m not supposed to say? My mother said it to me, and my dad didn’t freak out.\n",
      "Am I the asshole because I dont want to go see my mom.  I am a male(16) and I used to live with my mom most days because she got most custody when my parents divorced. She used to mentally abuse me but she didn't  know she did  (I think). Now that I live with my Dad I almost never see my mother and its by My own will. My mother doesn't know I resent and hate seeing her. She would manipulate me and every time I enter her house all she does is judge me and I hate her for it.   The last time I facetimed her all she did was judge me because I had black nails and she also Judged mt girlfriend for not believing what she believes in (she is very religious). Am I the asshole for not wanting to see her ever.\n",
      "i (18F) am being called petty and over dramatic for ignoring my friend (17F) for making an insensitive joke. let’s refer to her as sarah. for context, i’ve been friends with this girl for five or so years, basically since the beginning of high school. we’ve drifted apart as of late, but we’ve still remained school friends.  i found out from another friend, let’s call her jane, that sarah made a joke about how nobody she’s friends with has a father. she mentioned how jane’s father is dead, and how my father is fucked-up and absent. she also mentioned a couple of my other friends in this “joke” of hers. sarah was laughing as she made the joke, then proceeded to brag about having a good relationship with her father.  after hearing about that, i decided to ignore her. over the past five years, i’ve told her literally everything about my family’s circumstances and my father-related trauma, yet she still chose to make that the punchline of her joke.  what makes it worse is that sarah approached me when she found out i heard about what she said. she told me that it was just a rumour and it wasn’t that serious, that she was just fooling around. and that i had to “open my mouth and talk to her at some stage.” then proceeded to bitch and rant to other people about how i was ignoring her for “no reason.”  i’m not sure if i’m overanalysing it, and she probably didn’t intend for it to come off in that way because it’s just her “sense of humour.” but am i the asshole for ignoring her over a pathetic joke?\n",
      "My (27M) and 5 other friends since high school went out for an expensive dinner to celebrate my friends leaving for a year for his last year of law school. We are talking about a 12 set menu plus drinks and tips (20%) $200 in a fancy hotel downtown. The girl who booked the venue lets just call her \"Mandy\" is my close friend's GF. Initially, I declined and said that its way over my budget and offered to try for a less expensive venue.  Fast forward to one our get togethers where we all were intoxicated, Mandy brought up the dinner again and I decided to go after seeing how some people wanted me to go. So I checked the menu and thought at most I'll spend at most $150 for everything, ok, fine. How often do we go out to something fancy with the boys and their gfs?  The next night, I meet up with them at the fancy restaurant. Everyone gets a drink. I get a beer. People start ordering wine that pairing with their foods, my other friend is downing non-alcoholic drinks...  When the bill arrives Mandy's BF takes the bill and says he'll get the bill and we can pay him back later... From here, I knew that I will likely split the total of the bill. Cause there's no way you can calculate the liquor tax, tax, and tips. Ok fine, I'll just worry about it later.  A week later, \"Mandy\" sends me the excel sheet. Apparently, we will be paying for my friend's meal and its just the whole bill divided by 5 ( not including guy leaving) I told her that I didn't think it was fair that I have to pay for my future lawyer friend's meal she didn't make it clear to me. I confirmed it later with a friend at the table and he confirmed that she might have said that in-passing in the dinner? I knew this would make it awkward between our friend group, but I made the decision that I was only paying for my own portion. Of course, the rest was footed to her own bill, which was probably not the right thing.  The night of, Her BF starts messaging me saying I'm selfish, I only care about money, and don't value their friendship... He's basically mad at me for speaking out, that I made it awkward for him and her, and footing the bill to his GF. He's saying he's is not your gf so you can't treat your friend out for once? and that I only saw it as an expensive dinner instead of a fun night out together. I apologize to him and tried to reconcile our differences but to no avail. I sent the couple the total amount asking.\n",
      "I am a 19f in the military, i’ve been away from home for almost 7 months and have been a person with an extremely independent personality for years. My parents have helicopter parent tendencies such as needing to voice an opinion on everything i want to do and almost every time try and tell me no. One night they gave me some tough news about how they were getting rid of my dog (which didn’t end up happening) and that I was probably never gonna see him again. I absolutely lost it, and within two days i had a new tattoo and got my septum pierced. I told them about the tattoo the day after because that’s not exactly easy to hide since it was on my back, and they were a bit uneasy about it. I didn’t tell them about the septum for two weeks because i knew they would flip but I’m also an adult and made a decision to get something i wanted for a while. Anytime we facetimed or snapped, i’d always flip it up so they couldn’t see it. Two weeks later on easter my mom facetimed me so i could talk to the family, and without thinking i answered. The first thing i heard was “please tell me that’s not real” and when i realized i forgot to flip it up, i had an oh shit moment. I told her it was fake at the time, a magnet, so it wouldn’t cause drama with the family, but later on i called her to tell her it was real. She started crying, and was mad i didn’t tell her and after i said i don’t like telling them stuff because they usually flip out, she started blaming me. She told my dad before i could, i got a text from him about lying and how he needed space, and 4 days went by where they wouldn’t talk to me. My mom started making cow jokes, they call it the thing in my nose, say i’m prettier without it, and constantly asks when i’m going to take it out to let it close. She said she loves me but sometimes the things I do make her want to strangle me into the earth. Am i the AH for getting a nose piercing and not telling them?\n",
      "When I was 18 our family slowly started  to break into pieces. My half-sister left our family to live with her father and cut all contacts with us. My mom was shattered and had a hard time carrying on. I left for college a few months later, but at the beginning visited her every 1-2 weeks. Our relationship got more and more toxic over time. She started drinking heavily, started to fight with us on every occassion, insulting me and my sister with words a mother should never ever say to her children. The guilt train was also real: she always made us feel obligated to do something for her, because we owe her something for things she did to us in the past. We also had to break contact with our grandmother and uncle or else she wouldn't talk to us anymore. It got to the point where I almost always felt extremly shitty and worthless after talking to her. I also had a mild drug problem then, almost no friends and social anxiety that grew and grew until I rarely left my home. There also was no emotional support from her side. When I told her that I am struggling really hard and am so sad most of the time, she was barely interested in it. After one heavy fight, I decided to break contact with her, completly cutting her out of my life (this was when I was around 20/21). My sister did this much earlier, my mother was much meaner to her. We tried to repair what has been done on multiple occasions, e.g. arranging a christmas evening together or visiting her and try to talk. It always ended the same way: a huge fight where very, very ugly things were said.  I'm 25 now. Yesterday she called me, told me how much she suffered, how her kids have destoryed her, how I am the worst person on earth basically. In hindsight, I was very cold by just cutting her out. I understand now how hard loosing my half-sister must have been for her. What kind of person would I be, if my own child, the one thing I raised and loved more than anything on earth would repel me? I wish I would have had this perspective at that time, not taking the things she said so personal and just grab her and overwhelm her with love from her son. But at that time I couldn't. I was so caught up in my own struggles and dead emotionally. Even now I have problems with intimacy and closeness and basically don't feel loved by anyone, eventhough I have great friends in my life. It's just how I am and I try to work on it, but it's still very hard most of the time.  So my question to you: AITA for cutting my mother out of my life? Should I feel guilty for leaving my mother in a (how she calls it) living hell? Please be completly honest...\n",
      "First post, I'm nervous as heck and I'm on mobile, so sorry if there's formatting issues. Also, throwaway.  So, a few years back my brother moved in with us (my husband and I) when we got a new place, as we were all ready to get out of my parents place and figured it made sense for us all to live together.  I was pregnant with my first kid when we moved in, and had her several months later.  My relationship with my brother did not survive this. Things were kinda shitty before I had her, but they turned absolutely irreparable afterwards.  He made absolutely 0 effort to be around/be a part of my life/my kids life from the moment I stepped into the hospital, and he was blatantly disrespectful while he was blowing us all off.  My brother in law was stationed in Korea during this time, and he made an effort to be and succeeded in being a larger part of my newborn daughters life than my own brother ever has. Yeah. A guy stationed in a different COUNTRY was a better uncle than the guy sitting upstairs.   anyways, he moved out and we pretty much dropped all contact, mutually. He doesnt really like any of our family so he usually stays away from family events. Its been easy for us to just ignore each other. He doesnt seem to have any issue with this, and I dont either.  However, tomorrow is one of my extended family members birthday. We were all set to go and celebrate, but my mom texted me tonight and told me that my brother is going to be there.  I WOULD just go and ignore him, except I KNOW my family is going to refer to him as \"uncle (his name)\" around my daughter.  I dont want that. At ALL.   He has done nothing to be her uncle. Everyone she knows as an uncle, has made an effort to be in her life and she knows they love her. My brother has done nothing to warrant that title except be related to her by blood, and that's not good enough for me.  It would basically insinuate to her that my brother is a close family member, akin to her very beloved Uncle (BIL name), when he absolutely is not.  I would just ignore my feelings and deal with being uncomfortable about it - however, my kid is going to be 3 very soon. She's old enough now where if anyone refers to him as \"uncle (name)\", she's going to come home with me and ask about him/to see him.  That's why it's an issue. I dont want to deal with that.  However, I know that if I tell my family not to call him that in front of her, I'm going to be called out as the asshole.  Also, INB4 \"but he's family!\" Both my hubs and I have had difficult relations with blood family, so we subscribe to the \"family are those who care about you\" line of thinking.   One of my friends already kinda voted me as YTA because \"hes family and [I] cant keep him out of her life forever\" but I feel like I can and its warranted.  So, WIBTA for asking my family not to refer to my brother as my daughters uncle, and to just have him go by only his name instead?\n",
      "Throwaway account although I'm pretty sure no one this I'd about will ever come across this post - but better safe than sorry, right?   A few weeks ago, my brother in law and I got together for a play date with our kids at a local park. While the kids were playing, he decided to inform me some things going on in his relationship with my sister that was causing some issues between them. One of the biggest issues being that my dad kept wanting to buy some of the hunting knives out of my brother in laws collection.   Some of the knives weren't a big deal, however there was one in particular that my dad just wouldn't seem to let up on about getting. This knife was given to my brother in law as a gift from his dad on he and my sisters wedding day. He told me that he and my sister fought about the issue, but ultimately told my sister to just sell it to him because he was done fighting about it and didn't want to be rude in continuing to tell our dad no.   Fast forward to today, I had casually mentioned to my mom about how my brother in law didn't actually want to get a rid of the knife because it was a personal wedding gift to him. I didn't mention how my sister and brother and law had argued about it - just left it down to not wanting to give it away because it was gifted to him.   Later on my mom casually mentioned it to my dad, but asked him not to say anything. It was just in hopes that he'd hopefully take no as an answer the first time the next time he asks about getting a knife from them (this was already the 3rd knife).   Of course, my dad immediately mentioned it to my sister. She told our dad that that wasn't true at all and to not worry about it and to enjoy the knife. My sister in turn texted me and told me I should've kept my mouth shut and that she had never even been made aware by her husband (my brother in law) that he didn't want to get a rid of the knife because it was gifted.  I then decided to ask her why he'd lie about the fact that they fought about it and why he even told me in the first place about the knife if none of it was true.   I never recieved an answer from her, but rather a text from my brother in law that said \"We never fought about the knife and I didn't care that we sold it to your dad after your sister and I had a discussion about it.\"   I immediately felt like I was living in some sort of Twilight zone.   I've now been informed that my sister - and now brother in law - have told everyone that I'm lying and they've made everyone incredibly upset with me, including our dad.   I'm honestly not even sure what their end game for all of this is - however I'm feeling incredibly disheartened over the fact that not only did my brother in law potentially initially lie to me about the entire situation, or he was telling the truth and is now changing his story to keep the peace with my sister - or over the fact that my sister is throwing me under the bus and trying to paint me as a bad guy so easily and over a knife at that.\n",
      "My friend, let's call her Ash, is obsessed with yaoi, (BL manga and anime?) and cannot stop talking about it and centring her whole life around, you guessed it, yaoi. In a way, it's kinda perverse and just creepy to me, especially as I am queer myself. I just want to tell her to stop comparing EVERYTHING to MLM and then ruining a lot of wholesome stuff from her comparisons.   I painted a mountain, and she says, \"I saw that in the background of [whatever anime she was talking about at the time]\" There's a line between just liking MLM, and being weirdly obsessed with it. Ash is showing many signs of a fujoshi.\n",
      "Background: she’s Asian American and I’m white. We’re from Georgia, and we’re discussing the midterm election (this was before it happened). She said she did not want to Kemp to win because “he’s a white male and there are too many white men in power.” To which I said, “that sounds racist.”   I know that what she meant was ‘minorities are under-represented in politics,’ and that’s why she did not want him to win. Frankly, I would have agreed with her if that’s what she had said. But I told her the way she said that sounded racist, and she got furious with me; saying things like, “I’m a minority. I can’t be racist” and “you’re white so you‘ll never understand.” To which I again replied, “that also sounded kinda racist”  So am I an asshole?\n",
      "My family (wife, 5yo, 3yo) and I are at a campground with designated areas for camp fires.  We’ve been promising a campfire and s’mores all day since we’ve been cooped up a car for about 7 hours.  At the campground, the tent sites are close together and no barrier or trees around.  The sun is starting to set so kids need to get ready for bed soon so I need to start the fire soon or risk hellion kids.  As I’m starting the fire, the wind is blowing slightly causing the smoke to go in two different directions. Unfortunately, one of those directions is right towards my neighbors.  I casually apologize, and shrug with an ‘I can’t control it’ gesture but they give no acknowledgement so I thought whatever.  15 min later my wife leaves to wash dishes after we eat and I’m playing with my kids they aggressively say, ‘why you staring a fire and having the smoke blow right at me?!  Me: I can’t start a fire anywhere else otherwise I would   Them: but it’s blowing right at us!  Me: I’m sorry, I can’t control the wind but it should die down soon once i get it bigger  Them: or you could not have a fire   Me: I’m sorry, my kids have been waiting for this all day.  Them: alright whatever.  They storm off to the office manager - don’t know what was discussed but when they get back they gave my kids and eye a stink eye and moved their chairs to the otherwise of their tent.  AITA?\n",
      "I basically help get my uncles evicted from my deceased grandmother's home. I convinced my dad to do it and helped with process of getting them evicted. We lived there recently with them. We took care of my grandmother, which was the main goal of us being there. We loved her dearly. As soon as she passed, we knew we had to go. It took us almost a year to find a place. We exhausted our funds trying keep things going. We try to be civil and patience but my uncles made it impossible.   My uncles are addicts and freeloaders who pretty much destroyed the house. One practically flooded it causing so much damage, that it has to be gutted out now. Mold was also growing everywhere. Also, the bills and debts were crippling. We told them it was best to sell the house due to the debt and damage. They flip flop on the decision to sell daily. They lived free while we paid everything. One uncle ate up the food we brought with our money and got angry when we called him on it. The other retreated to his room whenever bills were mentioned. He has a job unlike the other. They both were argumentative and entitled. When we warned them that they had to go, they played the sympathy card and said they had no where to go. Basically they were going be homeless. We told them it was matter of time the city would take it and we would all be homeless but it was all about them. ME. ME. Woe is me! Who cares where we ended up at! We finally found a place and packed. We let them know we were ready to sell. We gave them ample time to also leave. They refused to sell. Said it was nothing wrong with the house and we just wanted money. My dad didn't want to cause conflict, so he was close to just letting them have the house. I convinced him otherwise. He was the personal representative so he could sell without them. The more we talked the more angry he got about it. He realized he was being too nice and my grandmother wouldn't want this. So we went through the process of selling. We told them it was sold and gave them 30 days once the paperwork was done. We passed 30 to almost two months as the new owner (who owns a company) tried to be nice as well. Well, they're response was to change the locks twice during the 2 months and act like none of it was happening. Me, my dad, and the new owner had enough. We were all pissed and had to literally break in. They wouldn't even come to the door. So they have ran out of time and have to go now.  Unfortunately, not everyone will agree with our decision. For example, a cousin has took pity on them no matter what I've said. She makes excuses for them and thinks they just need guidance. These men are well over their 40s. We're not taking care of two grown men.   Still I feel strangely guilty. Like did I do the right thing or if I'm am an heartless asshole.   AITA?\n",
      "Two months ago, my entire life essentially went to shambles. My family dog was diagnosed with terminal cancer, my step grandfather died, and multiple relatives fell severely ill or had to be hospitalized, including my own mom. I spent a lot of time crying, and just staying afloat with my classwork and occasionally dming friends to joke and try to take my mind off things.   The main problem came when whenever I talked to me friends, I seemed to get scolded for saying something that upset one of our friends. (We were supposed to keep an updated list of 'no-no' topics, stuff that would trigger anxiety/depression for some people. but occasionally I'd be scolded for mentioning that I was a student, where the only school related 'no-no' topic was grades.) They just figured people would read the chat logs and see people say they would prefer if we didn't mention xyz thing. I was online nowhere near often enough for that to work. It continued in this cycle for awhile, where I'd be offline for a few days, try to talk, eventually get told off for not knowing about certain topics, and I'd leave feeling like shit.   It all came to a head when I came on and tried to discuss something, and when I checked the list it wasn't there at all. I immediately got a dm telling me off, and I snapped. I sent a message telling everyone everything that had happened in my life recently, that I was struggling, and that this was my line in the sand. (I would always just leave for a bit if things upset me instead of asking to change topics and making someone feel guilty, like an idiot, so that definitely caused some resentment to form.)   The message was deleted overnight, so I made a much less polite version telling them I didn't owe them jack shit and that they shouldn't expect me to stick around if they pull that shit again. It stayed up, and I had people respond asking me to 'take it to dms'. I felt I had said my piece, and I felt pretty uncomfortable going someplace private to talk. I ended up ignoring the message, which I regret now, seeing as I should have just said I felt no need to speak privately and been done with the matter.   However, shortly after I sent that message, a friend who I'm gonna call A, left our group chat and ghosted me. I believe what I had accidentally mentioned to start this whole shitshow was something A said upset them. It wasn't until they sent a dm to me weeks later, telling me to 'learn to get over myself' that I realized something had to've happened.   I have a pretty bad memory, so I decided to go through our old dms to try and see if I had done something and just forgotten somehow like an asshole. I didn't find anything, and got no response when I asked mutual friends. I had avoided discussing everything happening in my life because I didn't want to be a downer, and I wanted to use hanging out with friends as an escape, but now I wonder if it's my fault for not telling them.   AITA?\n",
      "Hi, I have a question about a situation at work.  I am 27 and am working for a 50 people scale-up. We are a Salesforce partner. When I started at the company (19 months ago) we were a 2 man team focusing on a specific product, now we are with 8. It is my first job as I studied for 6 years (2 masters). During this period, people got hired with way more experience than me even though they are not much older. However, due to my contributions, my output, my drive, my knowledge, I got promoted to head of that specific business unit. Let’s say this was not received well by 1 other senior guy (he is a freelancer). This happened 5 months ago.   Recently he had his yearly performance review and he would like to be on the same level as I. My bosses told him to contact me and come up with a joint offer together. My bosses instructed me to only talk about job content, but he isn’t interested in that. He wants the title and recognition. I told my bosses that there are definitely parts of the job that he can do, but to be a co-business unit manager he is missing some essential things (in my opinion). He has suboptimal output, not really a team player, a few of my team have complained about him, he is a freelancer, etc. That’s what I told my bosses.  So of course he asks my bosses about the status and they told him that we didn’t agree on a joint offer. Afterwards he called me and he feels like I am holding him back, like I am the guy that doesn’t give him his recognition.   I hate the fact that my bosses have put me in this position, I think it should have been their decision from the start. But they are scared to frustrate any of us and be the bad guy.   Am I the asshole for “protecting” what I’ve worked very hard for to achieve? I think he is ahead of the rest of the team but not near my level of commitment at all. Don’t hold back, I am open to all criticism. I just want to know if I should trust my gut or if it’s an ego thing.\n",
      "Every since I was born, my brother has treated me like crap. I’ve been viewed as the annoying little sister. We would fight constantly growing up. In more recent years, he started to pick on me for my interest, body, and honestly anything.  He has even told me to take my life. My parents and I have tried several times to talk to him about what he is doing. We’ve tried everything, but he just doesn’t listen. Anytime I say anything, he has something to say about it. For example, as my family and I were eating dinner the other night, my Mother asked about my dorm neighbor and how he was doing. I had brought up the fact that he was so thankful for the Halloween bag I had given him, and he felt bad he didn’t have anything to give back. And my brother pipes in with a roll of his eyes, “you’re always the giving one. “ Now, this might seem small and nothing to most, but any rude comments from him hurt. And again, he always picks on me for my interest. Yet he says “if she calls I won’t hang up on her.” But he it makes so hard to talk about anything of mine or his interest. ( he would correct me on or whatever)  when he was home Thanksgiving, I didn’t say Hi to him right away when I walked downstairs, he got annoyed that I didn’t say Hi. So at this point I’ve given up at having an even decent relationship with him.\n",
      "My sister took me in unofficially after our mom dumped me with her because of her drug problems. She didn’t want me I could tell but our mom didn’t leave her with much options and I guess she decided to let me stay rather than being homeless or in the system. She took care of me ok and I always had my own room, clothes and food. She was resentful of me because she couldn’t go to school and had to work 2 jobs to take care of me while I lived with her. We didn’t talk very much and she was at work most of the day. The only things she would tell me was to clean the house or do my homework. I was 13 when I arrived at her place and 19 when I left. I’d gotten my CNA and moved out after getting a job. Now I’m 23 and broke with no place to live. I lived with my bf until he kicked me out and I’m now crashing with a friend but I need something long term. I’d also left my job due to working in unsafe conditions. The nursing home I worked at had residents that would regularly spit and attack the staff and I couldn’t take it anymore.My sister and I haven’t been in much contact since I moved out and it turns out she’s engaged. I asked to move back and she told me she didn’t have space for me and I had to make it on my own. I know she only took me in because our mom guilted her into it but I can’t go back to my mom and she’s my only option. I showed up at her place and asked to stay the night promising I’ll leave after a week. She gave up saying I had to leave after a week. Last night was the final night and I asked her again to stay longer. She basically told me for years I held her hostage where she was stuck looking after me with no life of her own and now that Im an adult Im back to do the same thing. I don’t want to be a burden to her but I don’t have any other options. Im back to staying with that friend but she’s told me she can’t let me stay past Dec.\n",
      "I’ve (26f) been dating this girl Em (23f) for 2 months. Em recently met my parents for the first time. Even though they didn’t talk much, she seemed to especially like my dad (57M). E has been enthusiastic when it comes to my dad’s music taste, as it’s similar to hers. She’s also found a lot of other stories about my dad funny.   The other day, Em and I were talking with some friends about cranberry bogs. I mentioned that my dad had worked in one as a teenager and relayed some of his hijinks there. Everyone found these stories funny, especially Em. She made a joke about how, considering my dad’s work experience and how much she liked him at their first meeting, the two of them should be business partners and open up a cranberry bog in my backyard. Em is a lively person and jokes a ton, so I just laughed it off. There’s no reason why to convert my yard into a cranberry bog, so I thought it was a joke.  I was incorrect. Em kept bringing it up. I just thought it was a bit, we have a few running jokes as a couple/friend group, but after 3 days I started to get worried. Last Wednesday, we were on the phone when she mentioned it again. I sarcastically told her to shut up, and she got quiet. I was taken aback, and said that I was just getting bored of the joke. She got defensive, and said that it wasn’t a joke; agriculture is an expanding market, and specialized products like cranberries are in high demand. She claimed she heard it from a professor.  I still wasn’t convinced that this wasn’t a bit, but I was getting annoyed. I told her that she couldn’t open a cranberry bog in my yard. She responded by pointing out that land near my house is zoned for agriculture, I have a large, flat backyard, and my dad has experience. I said it didn’t matter, and she wasn’t getting my dad involved because a) he’s already employed elsewhere and b) she’s met him once. She said that I was keeping her away from my family, which would hurt us in the long run. I hung up the phone.   The next day, I texted her in case I had overreacted to some crazy joke. I was relieved when Em apologized for being pushy. It seemed like it's all over...until a few hours later when she sent me budgeting spreadsheets, drafts of emails for potential investors, and a message for my dad about being business partners. We haven’t talked since. The worst part is that when I told my friends, they backed Em up. They said that none of us have had luck with employment, and it seemed like a waste to not use the land, my dad’s background, and Em’s ambition to try something new.   I have absolutely no idea what to do here. E and all of my friends are intelligent people normally, but there’s no way this business would work on any level. Between the fact I’ve been upset over this (my friends tend to call off a joke if someone is upset), and I don’t think it’s a bit anymore. So AITA for not letting my gf set up a cranberry bog with my dad?\n",
      "I (20NB) have a sister “Amy” (22F) who is 20 weeks pregnant. Note: the father “Kevin” (22M) is black and we are mexican.   A couple weeks ago, Kevin called Amy saying he’s not ready to take care of her and the baby. I let Amy know that she would raise this baby with the help of our oldest sister, our parents, and I; We reassured her she wouldn’t do this alone.   Amy told the other family members (tías, tíos, and cousins) most of the comments were “well he’s fitting into his own stereotype” “so that hard -er IS a complete loser” “this n word ain’t shit” etc. Amy feels weird about family using the word (i don’t feel comfortable typing it so I’m just going to say “the word”) around her it’s making her uncomfortable and uneasy. She’s afraid her baby is going to be around people calling him a slür knowing full well of the history behind it.  We have this entitled Tía Lola (49?F) claims she’s not racist but says the word and “there’s a difference between the word and ‘good’ black people. The words are the rude ghetto ones who like to cheat the system and the good ones are respectful and educated.” Tía Lola and I have always bumped heads because I’m the only one who calls her out on her bigotry.   Our family loves to use nicknames it’s nothing new in our culture, I came up with ‘Peanut’; (I went to the gender reveal ultrasound and the baby has/d a big head) I asked for permission to call the baby that. Amy liked it and gave me permission to call the baby Peanut, other nicknames we use; “bebé” spanish for baby or “tito”.   But Tía Lola on the other hand thinks it’s okay to call the baby “Cocoa” or “Chocomil” simply because the baby is mixed. Amy has told Tia Lola multiple times that it is uncalled for, racist, and colorist to assume the baby’s skin color and she was tired of the räcist comments. Amy simply asked her to change the nickname, that’s it. Tía Lola LOST IT saying she thought it WAS appropriate to call him that and thought Amy never saw it as a problem until I had mentioned it her (Amy).  I tried to respectfully tell Tía Lola that she needs to stop making comments if she wants to be around Amy’s baby. She needs to keep her comments to herself or she’ll have no contact with the baby (Amy isn’t confrontational but I am and wanted me to tell this to her) Tía Lola said she never saw it a problem and that it’s normal to be “räcist” and we should move past it. I told her she was being stubborn and difficult to go along with my sister’s wishes.   It's also the fact that she’s more hurt over Amy asking her to change the nickname or calling him bebé like everyone else. If Amy doesn’t like it, then she doesn't. At the end of the day, it’s her son.   Tía Lola and other racist family members are calling me the AH for speaking for my sister and calling our Tía a räcist, cölorist, and a bïgot. The ones who are siding with Amy and I are saying it was about time someone told her that the comments made were and are unacceptable.   So AITA?\n",
      "My mum (57F) and I (18F) often take walks together. We have pleasant conversation, but it always leads back to the same thing: my depressed sister and terrible father. She’ll consistently repeat the exact same stories expressing her sadness of how torn up the family is, recounting how my father acted towards both my mother and sister, all things I’ve seen firsthand.  Today, I told her that the constant repetition of these stories often brought the mood down when I’ve always made the effort to be happy, and that this pattern showed she was constantly flipping these moments around in her head. I mentioned considering a therapist. I told her she shouldn’t repeat the stories to me as they served no purpose to improve the situation and only made us miserable.  I know I came off as rude and uncaring (I struggle with showing compassion (?) to the point where I’ve locked myself in a different room while my mother cried loudly in hers since I didn’t know what to do…), but at the same time these stories made me dread going out with her and I felt it would only get worse if I let it continue.  AITA? And if so, how do I fix it?\n",
      "First and foremost: I love my husband. He is everything I dreamed of for a husband.  I am currently in college in a STEM program. It's all online. I also do door dash to help with bills. My issue is every chance my husband gets, he video calls me, texts, or walks in my office while I try to concentrate. I have ADHD and OCD so I have to do a ritual when I need to study. I get in a groove and usually on camera for body doubling. It never fails when he interrupts me. I have talked to him about it and even move some of my schedule when I know he will call or come home from break. I just feel like I'm not getting enough done.  Would I be the AH if I locked my office door and put my phone on silent? How can I explain to him that it's distracting when he does it? I get embarrassed when I'm on camera and he walks in to show me stuff that can wait. Please and Thank You.  Edit: spoke with my husband and laid out all the advice given here. He apologized for interrupting me and told told me if I need the lock to go ahead. Also, we will have shared calendars on our phones and if he is on break and I'm supposed to be studying he'll send one text to see if I'm free if I don't respond then he knows I'm busy. Thank you\n",
      "I've lived in my apartment for 11 ½ yrs. 6+ months ago new neighbors moved in above us. I have kids myself but as we live in apartments I don’t let them do anything that might bother anyone; screaming, running/bouncing balls inside, etc.  As soon as they moved in the 4yo started running thru their apartment, stomping, jumping off furniture, & ultimately shaking my home. I have been trying to ignore it (unsuccessfully, I have sensory disorder & it's truly driving me crazy as I feel it inside my body each time these loud bangs happen), hoping that she will outgrow it.  They have a 1yo learning to walk who I worry will start following suit. I am overwhelmed by the excessive & nearly constant pounding, literally no less than 3 hours everyday between 7am and 9pm, sometimes earlier, sometimes later.  Now, I fully understand that some noises will happen. We live on a busy road, with cars, dogs, sirens, etc. so I am by no means expecting silence but this shaking of my home that I feel inside my body, has been going on for 6+ months  daily  w/ no end in sight. I can’t take it anymore.  I have not yet talked to them. I tried a few times when they moved in but got ignored… I was you do you until they started doing the most asinine things like piling bags of trash on the front porch. I eventually got the landlord involved on that & heard them make snide remarks on their way up the stairs the day the sign got put up to be mindful that skunks/bugs are attracted & to use a can. Now there are trash cans taking over the front porch 🤦‍♀️ whatever, aside from the flies, it doesn’t effect me other than hating how bad our building looks now.  This though? This effects me. I don’t know if that’s just the price you pay for living on the 1st floor (though I have lived under kids before w/ parents like myself who didn’t allow them to run around while living upstairs) or if this is excessive enough that it’s logical to ask for it to be stopped?  Like I said, I'm not expecting silence but this is too much, too often. Experiencing sensory overload along w/ PTSD has become extremely difficult as I cannot even be at home w/out feeling severely increasing anxiety. Not to mention I'm pregnant & don’t want my newborn startled awake by it once LO arrives.  I don’t want to be considered a Karen by saying something if I should just leave it be, that said I cannot enjoy my home when this is literally happening hours daily.  It’s effecting my mental health. I wish it wasn’t but don’t know how to fix it when I can't just move to another room as she runs loops thru the entire apartment. I cannot get away from it w/out physically leaving my home.   I don’t want to cause drama with the neighbors, just desperately want this to end. We want to move but don’t know how long it is going to take to find a new place as we’ve been looking even before they moved in. I don’t want to continue to suffer in silence in the meantime.   Would I be the asshole to ask my landlord to get involved?\n",
      "I'm a sophomore in high school, and have been very insecure and depressed. There was this person in my history class who started talking to me and made me very uncomfortable. However I felt like I had to be her friend because she wanted to be my friend. Throughout the whole friendship I'd been very uncomfortable and was manipulated. She flirted with me constantly despite me saying no and became very touchy with me. I felt sexually harassed and when I told her she laughed and said she's messing with me. I was too scared of saying anything to her. Over Christmas break I ended up at the mall with her and I tried on a pair of Jordan 1s because I figured why not. A few days later she said she was going to get me these shoes for Christmas, I told her not to and that she didn't have to. I knew she would use them for leverage on me and I still didn't want to be her friend so I didn't want her dropping  large amounts of money on me. She ordered them anyway and I ended up with them. I felt worse and worse every day. I was forced to hangout with her and her friends, and her friends hated me. I had other things happening too at the time and ended up just crashing one day. She could tell I was off and wanted to know what was wrong. I told her nothing and that I didn't want to tell her, and eventually she forced me to say by telling me I was a terrible friend for not saying anything. I told her how often I had panic attacks, how depressed and miserable I was, and how lonely I felt. She told me I was wrong and that I wasn't depressed, only sad. She also told me that all her friends loved me and that I shouldn't be saying rude things about them. She went on about how bad I should feel and I snapped. I told her to back off me and that I wanted a break from her for a little while. She egged me on and said that I was just being a ***** and that I was just running away. I told her to get out of my life and blocked her on everything. Since then I have realized heavy things that had to change and I am now in the process of fixing myself. But apparently I didn't block her on Facebook and she messaged me saying that I have to give her 140 dollars for the shoes as I'm too disrespectful for them. I haven't responded as I don't want her in my life anymore and am doing everything I can to make sure she stays away from me. I don't think I need to give her back the shoes as I objected to getting them and they were a gift. Am I an asshole for not giving them back?\n",
      "Im currently unemployed and been feeling useless most recently. I left my well paying job almost a year ago to see what life would be like moving away from the drama between my parents divorce but moved with no plans and no job aligned for me.  With COVID happening it became extremely impossible to find anything and now that unemployment is pretty much over im losing it with not being able to find a job.  My bf is doing amazing with his sales and was mentioning how much money he made in July. I didn’t say anything then because I’m proud of him but inside I was feeling like complete shit. Now today, we went out for lunch and cut him off mid sentence when he was going to say how much he was going to be getting for last month and told him not to tell me because I was going to feel bad. He was surprised that I said that and told me that he wants me to be proud of his success (which I am) and wants to share those moments with me.   I just can’t help but to feel that with me not having a job and not being able to bring anything to the table, I’m not good enough.   Am I the asshole for saying anything??\n",
      "Every time something happens, good or bad, my mother and/or brother have a habit of throwing my bedroom open to tell me. It's usually something bad, like someone dying or getting hurt or sick. I like to sit and listen to music through my headphones so I can't hear when someone knocks so I look up from my laptop and my door is thrown open and some is mad or upset or crying but it takes me a moment to hear them because headphones. Or they manage to throw my door open in the five seconds I'm changing clothes or if I happen to be dancing around.  Now I can't sit and listen to music with headphones in without obsessively watching my bedroom door because it might fly open and I might get frightened. For example, just now, my mother threw my bedroom door open, she was red-faced and covering her mouth with her hand and her face was screwed up. I had headphones in so I thought she was crying. I yanked my earbuds out and asked her was she laughing or crying and she didn't answer just kept exhaling and inhaling quickly behind her hand so I yelled at her \"are you laughing or crying?!\" Finally she said she was laughing and showed me something cute our kitten was doing. I couldn't even laugh at the cat because I was so nervous and my heart was racing and my hands were shaking. I dismissed the kitten's cuteness and sort of snapped at my mother that they have got to stop throwing my door open because every time they do it freaks me the hell out because I think something is wrong. My mother responded by rolling her eyes and saying, \"Oh, god\", like it was such a huge fucking deal.  I've asked her repeatedly to text me if she's coming in but she says that she shouldn't have to that. Tells me I shouldn't have my music so loud that I can't hear her knocking. I've also told her repeatedly that if she knocks and I don't answer then she shouldn't just come in. She says it's her house and she'll do what she wants. Doesn't matter that I'm 26 years old and a fucking adult, she just keeps on doing it. And, she does it to my brother. And even though he complains about it he does it to me. I'm the only fucker in this house who knocks!  So, the latest incident as told above happened about ten minutes ago and I'm still shaky, still nervous, I haven't been able to turn my music back on because I'm just so freaking jittery now. It makes me feel unsafe in the security of my own bedroom. She once threw the door open at 6am while I was having some \"personal time\" and got mad at me for yelling at her to leave. I mean, yes the door wasn't locked but it was 6am, if I can't have privacy at 6am then when can I?  I just need to know if I'm an asshole for having an explosive reaction or if I overreacted. Moving out IS NOT a feasible option right now, despite having a full-time job with benefits rent starts at $1600 is my area and I can't find a roommate and renting with my brother is not an option at all.  AITA?-Edit: I pay rent for my room and I contribute to other bills, does that not entitle me to some privacy and respect. If I were a stranger paying for this room would I then not be entitled to the respect to my own space and privacy?\n",
      "I 16m have a friend 16m and we where talking about just small embarrassing things about ourselves.   And he mentioned how he heats his pillows so when he rests his head on them it feels like the warmth of a person.   And that was his exact phrasing. So my reaction is “woooow, like fuck, that’s really sad, like Jesus fuck that’s baaaad, God.”   And he says of fuck off, and starts calling me out for being a prick to him over it.   But I tried explaining it wasn’t judging him just stating what it was, mean he himself sees it as sad because that’s why he shared it.   And it’s obviously directed at the act itself not him, like I’m not calling him sad.   And I’m not mad at him for being pissed because he’s high functioning autistic, and sometimes doesn’t pick up what’s directed where in a conversation.   Or maybe it was me idk\n",
      "This has been sitting on me for a while now so I figured I'd ask. It's pretty long, so tl;dr at the bottom.  &#x200B;  Context: When I was 13, my mother's father passed away and she was unable to handle that trauma. She became very emotionally and verbally abusive towards me for the next 5 years until I moved out and went to college at 18, and would always argue that because she was sheltering me, feeding me, and giving me money to help participate in an activity that I enjoyed, she was allowed to treat me the way she did. Whenever I brought up that I was hurt by her behavior towards me, she would claim to have forgotten treating me in that way, that it never happened and I was just imagining things, or would state that I completely deserved however she treated me.  &#x200B;  I moved far away for college, and essentially cut ties with her. The one thing holding me back is that my father is paying for part of my college tuition, which my mother then expects me to pay back with a 7% interest rate. Because my father still pays my tuition, I am expected to come home and visit the family often, something that is really hard for me to do because I have so much anger towards my mother from the way she's treated me.  &#x200B;  Ever since I moved out, she has been exceptionally nice to me. She always takes my feelings into consideration, and is always excited to see me. I feel bad about the fact that I still hold a grudge against her when she appears to have just moved on. I feel like if she was willing to apologize for the hurtful things she did, or at the very least, admit that she did things that were not acceptable, I would be more open to rekindling a relationship with her, but as it is, I have no desire to try to mend what has already been very much burnt to ash. I've tried to mention that I am still hurt by her previous behavior, but she pretends that it never happened at all.   &#x200B;  I have moved on in that I have chosen to put it all behind me, and focus my energy on treating the problems that I have that sprung up from what she did. I feel as though she can't even see that she did anything wrong, or that she does see her wrongdoing, but is too prideful to apologize and instead just pretends everything is fine. I am not okay with either of these situations because I did come out of this with trauma that affects me a lot, but that I am actively working to overcome.  &#x200B;  tl;dr Mother burnt all desire within me to have a real relationship with her through treating me like a metaphorical punching bag for 5 years of my life, and her continued pretense to this day that none of it ever happened. Has started to treat me much better in present day after I went to college, and seems to desire a real relationship. AITA for not trying to even start a relationship with her until she apologizes for hurting me so badly?\n",
      "I was abused by a friend for 2 years. Some things they did: guilt-tripping me for my PTSD (someone said a racial slur that triggered me & they got mad at me, said it was wrong of me to assume the person who said it wasn't Asian, if I broke down they'd say \"if you don't stop right now I'll ignore you\"), screamed & swore at me when I tried to talk to them abt their actions. Some things they said: \"I'm always so calm when you talk to me, you're making shit up\", \"you're literally ruining everything\", \"you have no right to be scared of me, unlike everyone else I put up w/ your shit\". Tried to isolate me from friends & family, I said I didn't appreciate what they did, they got mad & said \"I've been dissociating a lot lately so you're being a dick for being so upset\", tried to force me into a relationship. I didn't feel the same way & told them that I didn't want to be in a relationship. They kept saying I'd never know until I try, I said no but then they kept telling me to do it. If I asked them when I did any of the things they said I did, they would never tell me, just said \"you did it first\". They told me they knew me best & helped me more than anyone else ever did, that they were the only one who cared. It ended when they said they needed to know I was seeing a doctor and hear what she said. I said I don't owe them anything & it was for only me, my parents & doctor to know. They said I was overreacting. I said to leave me alone & they got mad. They spammed my Insta, when I didn't respond they went on Discord, swearing at me & demanding an apology. I told them I was done, they told me \"it's a decision we both need to make together, you can't just decide that on your own.\" I blocked them on everything & went to one of my best friends. I told her about everything. She was sympathetic & said that she would support me. Despite this she continued to hang out with them. A bit later I posted on my Insta story telling people not to interact if they were still in contact w/ any of my abusers even after knowing what they did. She DMed me that she felt bad. I asked why. She said she still kept in touch with my abuser bc they never did anything bad to her. I told her that I wouldn't be friends with her if she still kept in touch with them willingly after everything they did. She got her GF to DM me, saying I was being childish & that \"it was upsetting to see her go through this\". I said what my abuser had done, and she said \"people can change.\" My friend DMed me that I was being immature for making her choose & she wanted to still be friends w/ both of us bc she \"wanted to stay neutral & vibe with everyone\". She said making people ditch them just bc of a bad experience I had was selfish, \"your fear of them is extremely farfetched bc they already moved on. I won't choose sides it's petty. You need to wait for them to change, you're disregarding my feelings\". I blocked her & regret speaking out about it. I feel like I was being selfish. AITA?\n",
      "Here’s some background info:  I grew up pretty chubby. Around the time I was 13-14, I started to become conscious of my body. I had decided to make a change and start exercising and eating healthier. I've lost about 15-20 kg and I'm now very happy with my body. (I’m 17)  My uncle had visited my family and I from America for the first time a few years back when I was insecure about myself. He was really fun to be around and I look up to him.  My uncle had recently gotten married to someone (Who’s now my aunt) and they both decided to stay with us for about a month or so.   The first thing she mentioned when saw me was that she didn’t recognize me because I lost so much weight. (I’m guessing my Uncle showed photos of my siblings and I from when he first visited).   She’d constantly make comments about my body and I had started to get very uncomfortable. “Wow, you’re so skinny now. You looked much better before” she’d also grab my wrist and see if she could fit her pointer and thumb around my wrist. “Oh my, you’ve become a stick” .  (She’s on the heavier side BTW) I would just laugh it off or just completely ignore her. Sadly, I suck at communicating and confrontation so I could never stand up for myself. There was a time where we were at a restaurant and she asked the waitress for “the food with the most calories” and to “give it to my niece” she has even told my mom to feed me because I'm anor*xic. ( Even though I am not)  So recently, my aunt and my mom decided to go grocery shopping. I usually get my own groceries because I enjoy eating healthier and I'm also a pescatarian . I was in class during all of this so I didn't know they were going.  Once I got home I saw the groceries full of junk food and sweets. I asked my mom where my food was but my aunt interrupted and said “these are your foods. Since you’re so slim and thin you'll need these foods to gain the weight back so that you’ll be more prettier.”  At this point I was fumming with anger. I grabbed all the food that was intended for me and threw them in the trash. (the trash had been recently change so there was nothing gross in it.) I told my aunt, “ what I put in my body is none of your business, so stop.” and I had walked out of the house.   Now I'm getting message from family members telling me what I did was wrong and that I should apologize and come back home.   I'm upset at everyone right now but I feel really bad for what I had done.  So, am I the assh*le??\n",
      "Please bear with me, English isn't my first language. So I'm a gay guy, and occasionally I go to bathhouses to get a good massage, and some steam room action. After what seemed like a couple of hours, I decided to go home. While I was in the locker room, one of the guys I hooked up with asked me if I wanted to grab some coffee, and I obliged.  We were having a good time talking over coffee, and as we were about to end, I invited him to go into a motel for a quickie. At first he was hesitant to go because its already really late, and he has work the following day. But I was horny so I insisted, and he eventually agreed.  At the motel, everything was okay at the beginning. The foreplay was amazing, and I'm not gonna go into the details, but we seemed to be having fun.  After about 30 minutes, I decided to finish myself. This is where the trouble begins. Because I came first, I kinda lost interest, and my FUBU caught on to this. I told him that I'm still interested, and I tried to continue pleasuring him, but he started acting all upset. He kept asking me if I only asked him here because I wanted a one night stand, which I denied. I did like him, well at first, but now he's acting all clingy and needy. At that point I didn't even know what to say anymore, so there was just silence. Until he decided to leave.   I know that it's also my responsibility to make my FUBU finish and I did try, but obviously it wasn't enough for him. So am I the asshole here or was he just being dramatic?  TL;DR: Had a hookup. I came first. I lost interest in my FUBU after that. Now he's upset.\n",
      "Less than 2 months ago I signed a lease on an apartment with one of my close friends in the city where we both go to school. At the time we signed the lease, I was living at home in a different city due to covid, so we both knew she would be moving in, getting the keys, etc. a little before I would.  Before signing the lease, we checked the google reviews for the apartment building and noticed several people complaining that the building charged them for damages that were already there when they moved in. I told my roommate I was worried about this and we agreed we'd just have to mark everything down on the damage report they give you when you move in.  Since I was still at home the day we got possession of the apartment, she went to collect the keys and fill out this form. She called me to let me know once she was in the apartment, and upon mentioning the damage form I started to tell her things I wanted her to check. She was annoyed that I was insinuating she couldn't figure it out on her own and literally wouldn't let me finish. She started interrupting me and eventually just shouted over me. I gave up and hung up. She eventually called back and apologized.  When I moved in I noticed some scratches on my bedroom floor, not a huge eye-sore or anything just standard wear and tear. I assumed she had written it down because I thought I heard her mention she included some scuffs on our floors/walls. Yesterday I decided to double-check and asked her if she wrote them down. She just kind of looked at me like it was a stupid question, eventually telling me no.   I said \"let's hope that doesn't come back to bite us in the ass\" and she said \"you mean you\". I'm now realizing she actually thinks I'm going to solely pay for her mistake if they charge us for the scratches.   WIBTA if I just refuse to pay if they try to charge us for the scratches on my floor? We signed the lease together and who occupies which bedroom is not relevant, so we'll be charged collectively if that is the case. I'm certain she'd end up paying if I refused because she's stressed out by legal notices and stuff like that. I'm not really, and I literally wouldn't pay them until they took me to court.\n",
      "I'm just now finishing my semester and this one particular class (anatomy related) has been a complete nightmare this semester. Due to COVID restrictions it's been a mix of online/in person lecture and during the labs we've only been able to physically hold the material for about 2 hours, which in the previous semesters can be done every day, once a week which has impacted my ability to comprehend most of the material as I am a hands on learner. I've reached out to both the TA's and professor about the opportunity for extra credit and this was given in 2 points for one exam and 9 for the other. I've also been to every lecture and lab, completed all the homework, and even asked for one on one time with the TA to get help understanding the material throughout the semester. The issue comes with my final grade in the class is a 79.5% and a B would be 80%. I, thinking it wouldn't be an issue, reached out to my professor asking if there was an assignment I could redo/do in order to get that curve and was initially told to read the syllabus as they have an odd grading scale and would require a 380 total point for a B but I'm currently at the 370 range. I figured explaining to this professor that I've struggled with the class formatting and have tried reaching out would show that I have tried my best this semester to succeed would help my case and they didn't respond to my question about the assignments so I sent another email with this exact detail. This professor responded back that this wouldn't be an equal opportunity for everyone if I only get it and that they dropped 2 of the lowest exams. This was totally understandable except the professor took it a step further by saying \"while your participation and quiz score was solid your exams were not. On the exams you never earned even a 50% correct overall score I'm sorry but I cannot give points\". This clearly made me heated because my exam percentage is as follows: 57%, 68%, 73%. I don't think this professor had to take it to this personal level about my grades if the factor of not giving extra credit was because it wasn't an equal opportunity. WIBTA to reach out to this professor about their failed mathematical unnecessary attack?\n",
      "On mobile sorry if formatting sucks. For context, my boyfriend/fiancé of 5 yrs and I share a bedroom. We are the only people renting our four bedroom house. At night when I go to go to sleep, he stays up sometimes upwards of 4 or more hours on his computer which is in the same room. He insists on keeping the lights on and tries to block the door if I try to go to one of the other rooms to sleep. Acts like I'm horrible for not wanting to be in the same room. Honestly I just want to be able to sleep without having lights in my eyes. AITA??\n",
      "My husband and I have three daughters. They are all absolutely gorgeous. Our oldest (19) and youngest (13) look more like me, while our middle daughter (17) looks more like her father.  My husband definitely has more strong amd unique features but I find him incredibly good looking, which is why I even married him.  Our middle daughter, however, has decided that her father is ugly, and by looking like him, so is she.  I feel very sad that she's trying to compare herself to bullshit beauty standards.  Unfortunately, she's also been teased at school and while we've managed to stop that, it hasn't helped the issue.  Our daughter's problems with her appearance started when she was around 12 and despite therapy and us trying various  techniques recommended by therapists, her attitude is unchanged.  But it's really escalated the past few years when she started blaming her father for inheriting his genes. I have shut her down every time but my husband just lets her blame him if I'm not around.  Recently, my poor husband broke down in tears while we were in bed and said he felt really guilty that our daughter looks like him and that he can't help that's he's ugly. He has never had issues with his appearance before and was always very confident.  I was completely crushed. My husband also said that we should maybe look into paying for some of the plastic surgery our daughter has demanded. I disagree with that completely and we fought over it.  The next day, I confronted my daughter and I told her I understand she has serious self-esteem issues but she is being cruel to her father.  This triggered a meltdown from her and she hasn't talked to any of us since. She hasn't left her room in nearly two weeks. She won't even eat unless one of us leaves food outside her door.  My husband is gutted and is still blaming himself.  Was I wrong to say what I did?\n",
      "My husband (23) and I (20) lived together in a big city and we worked for the same company. In Feb 2021 one of our coworkers was struggling and we offered for him to move in with us since we had a spare bedroom. He declined but one of our other coworkers, Paige, (25f) overheard and asked if she could move in when their lease expires with her husband, Joe, (28m) We agreed.   I got pregnant in May of that year and had a difficult pregnancy so I had to quit my job. Initially we were all going to contribute 1/4 rent since we were all employed, but we asked if they were willing to each contribute 1/3 rent since i was unemployed and they agreed.They moved in Oct As soon as they moved in we realized they didn't have much things. It turns out they don't even have a car and they would use the extra car that J’s family had since they lived with them. Since my husband and I had 2 cars we would lend them mine.  Everytime P made food, she would never clean up after them. They wouldn't even throw the toilet paper in the trash, they would kinda just toss it to the side. They would use everything that's mine without permission. I bought all the groceries and they ate everything. My husband and I bought a mini fridge without telling them and place it in our walk-in closet. one time I asked them not to eat something and P said, \"why don't you just put it in the fridge in your closet.\"  P has family in a little border town in Mexico and one time they left in my car without telling us for a whole week, we live in AZ. I was obviously mad and from that moment I told them they couldn't use my car anymore. After our baby girl was born in January, we decided to move back home to Texas starting next year. We bought a house for when we move. We then found out that P was going around work telling all our mutuals that we don't pay rent and I don't contribute anything. My husband confronted her and they said we should be embarrassed that they're pulling in all the weight and we're basically living for free. It turned into a big argument and J told my husband we shouldn't have gotten a house if he wasn't going to go half and half on rent. my husband was over it and told them to start buying new furniture because we're going to move out as soon as we can. Well now, they left all week due to thanksgiving and my husband and I started packing EVERYTHING that was ours from the furniture, dishes, shower curtain, even The bed that they used. We’re leaving tomorrow. We didn't tell them ahead of time because we're still salty about the argument so they will be getting here Sunday to a completely empty apartment. we aren't confrontational people so part of me is saying I'm TA for not warning them so I need to know if I am.\n",
      "This was years ago, but I still think this was funny and I want to know your take on it. One day I decided it would be fun to pull a little prank on my best friend. Spoiler alert, it ended up being much more then a little prank. I wanted to see if I could make my best friend (we’ll call him Bobby) actually believe that aliens were real. That was all it was to start with. So I made a video of me in my bathroom claiming to be from the year 2020. To spice it up a little, I said that they have taken over Earth. It was past me and Bobby’s duty to stop this from happening. I showed him the video the next day, and of course he was skeptical. But after a couple days of convincing, he was a little more accepting that it could actually be possible? Anyway he starts asking questions and any plot holes in my story, would be explained by my next video message from my future self. In one of my videos, I had said that I was the last human alive. Me and my family were able to survive because we won some sweepstakes or something to win an indestructible material that I lined my house with it. I don’t know it was dumb. I even spent time researching to make an excuse if were they would land, it was some place in Turkey because it had a high deposit of fossil fuels and supposedly that’s what their ships ran on. To make a long story short, this went on for THREE MONTHS. At the end of the prank, future me’s last message said that he had a double agent inside of Area 51 working on a special weapon that would help save the world. All we had to do was get to Area 51 and he would be on the outside to give us the weapon. The reason it ended there was because what was I going to do? Just go to Area 51 with him? Anyway randomly one day, I called him on the phone and told him it was a prank. He immediately hung up and didn’t talk to me for a week. I still think it was hilarious, but he obviously didn’t think so. Just to be clear I even think I was the asshole, but that it was still funny. So... AITA for letting my best friend believe that aliens were going to come to Earth and kill everyone, and that it was our responsibility to save the world?\n",
      "So my (22F) brother (18) and I share an apartment and it’s become a habit to lock the main door to the house from the inside for several reasons.                         When I’m out at night or evening time he always locks the door on me and when I get home I have to knock for a bit before he comes to open up, this has happened twice so far and then after a really long day I get home today and I try to open the door with my key and I was again locked out.                                                      After telling him twice already that he shouldn’t lock the door when I’m out so I ended up yelling at him because It was very upsetting and he says I’m just overreacting because and it’s a habit for him which I got him into in the first place so he’ll do it again because he can’t help it. All I’m asking for is a little consideration,Just remember I’m out and don’t lock the door on me. AITA here?   TLDR: yelled at my brother for locking me out multiple times aita ?\n",
      "Sidenote: sorry for the bad formatting, on my phone.  So I am a programmer, in my parents mind that equals IT.  Any time they need something done with their phones or computer they want my help.  At first I was like \"yea, sure, let me show you how it's done\" for anything they wanted, wether it be downloading music/video, googling stuff, moving files from their phone to the computer etc.  This year my mom got an iphone after I pleaded her to get an android(because I knew she would ask for my help and I never touched an apple product in my life) but she insisted even after I told her I have no idea how to use it. Let it be known that this is her FIRST smartphone.  And of course she gets annoyed everytime I fail to help her despite my best efforts because I just never ever touched that OS and if she wants me to learn it I need her phone for a couple weeks.  The same goes for our brand new Smart TV, which I never touch nor use nor see. I have told my parents that I have no idea how to use it or their weird modem with their special internet channels(mostly Russian shows).  My dad gets annoyed because I get annoyed that he REFUSES to learn anything(almost anything) Asked me to send an email I give him a 10 min tutorial on how to do it.  Next time he asks I show him again.  The 10th time I show him how.  The 20th time I ask him why doesn't he do it himself  he says \"I don't know how\" and I say \"I have shown you 10+ times\" he says \"so what? You need to do what I ask without any questions\"  Today he asked me to send an sms he got to my mom's mail and I confront him saying \"Why don't you ever learn how to do it?\" And he just answers \"what do you care, I ask for your help once a week just do it.\" And of course he gets angry at me for even ASKING.(and he asks for my help for anything and it happens daily)  AITA?\n",
      "So my father has recently shared with myself and my sister what he is updating his will to. The will is going to state that obviously my sister and I are each going to get half which is fine. some back ground on this is I have a 3 year old daughter, my sister has been trying to have a kid but has had difficulty. Back to the will now, in the event my sister passes all the estate goes to myself, if I pass my share goes to my daughter. The issues comes with the executor of the estate, I have told my dad it should be my wife of whom have i been married to for 15 years. ,my dad says it should be my sister since she is blood. I told my dad it’s his decision ultimately but i wouldnt want to have my wife asking for permission on making financial decisions for my daughter so i told my father if my wife isn’t in charge of her estate to just leave it all to my sister  my thought is that I have been married for 15 years and it is very insulting that you don’t trust my wife that you have known for over 15 years to manage an estate you leave my daughte. On the other hand it’s also their decision, so AITA\n",
      "I’ve had a group chat with about 8 of my closest friends for a few months now. I recently introduced my boyfriend to them, and they all took a liking to him. I added him to our group chat (all of my friends are okay with this) and that was that.   Today, we brought up my ex in the chat, and out of respect, I briefly removed my boyfriend while we talked about my ex. I didn’t want him to feel uncomfortable, because when he talks about his sex life pre-me, it makes me uncomfortable.   He got upset in our private messages and said things like “this is why I don’t open up” and told me it made him uncomfortable to exclude him from the conversation. I asked if he “really wanted to read messages of me fucking my ex”. He called me “unbelievable”.   AITA?\n",
      "Disclaimer: this post is not about the merit of my relationship or about whether or not I’ll marry my fiancé. I will with or without a ring. This is about whether I’m an asshole for wanting to make a bigger financial investment on a piece of jewellery.   My fiancé and I are having an official engagement ceremony done in January. We got “unofficially” engaged (In SO’s culture an engagement is a process and more than just a personal decision) a month ago, without a ring. Now during the ceremony he is to give me a ring. I don’t normally place any value or importance on shiny, expensive luxury items and he knows this. So he just assumed I didn’t care about an engagement ring either. His plan as of now is to go to an accessory shop and get any cheap ring that won’t make my finger go green.   To my own surprise even, I’ve been quite sad about this. To me this ring holds so much meaning and I want to wear it for the rest of my life. I’ve been researching/daydreaming a little and have found a few rings I really like. Problem is they are  way  more expensive than what my fiancé was thinking of. I don’t want any diamond ring because I find their pricing absurd, frankly, but would love a moissanite one because I love the look of it. With the style I like it would come to about 600-900 dollars.   I realise this is a lot of money. I don’t expect him to pay for it alone and would happily give him half (or more, since I’d be the one enjoying it haha). With all the costs surrounding our engagement ceremony it would be more financial pressure, which is why I was thinking we could get a “cheap” ring for the ceremony and then replace it with the one I want some months down the line when we can comfortably afford it together.   One part me thinks it’s okay for me to want to be picky and want to spend more on something I hopefully will wear for the rest of my life. Another part feels like a massive asshole for I guess feeling what he’s thought of isn’t good enough and putting more financial pressure on us. So. AITA?\n",
      "I (18F) left for college in September and moved out of my house in December simply because I could not take it anymore. My stepdad (46M) has two daughters from a previous relationship — my stepsisters, Maliyah (22F) and Alexia (27F). My mom (42F) has me from a previous relationship and my brother (12M) with my stepdad. My biological dad is not in the picture.   Growing up, my stepdad made me watch (or listen) as he beat Maliyah for getting a grade below a C or for getting in trouble. It should be noted here that he is a narcissist and does not care for anyone else besides himself and only cares a little bit about my brother because he's always wanted a son. My mom has and continues to cater to his needs above everyone else's — this includes hers and her children's (as well as her job on occasion). So, after dealing with the same bull for 15 years, I realized my mental health was tanking being in the same household as him. Alexia has recently decided to stop talking to our parents as she is also tired of their behavior.   Skip to now — summer. I recently decided to transfer schools from Colorado to Alabama. I told my mom I'm staying in Alabama with a friend but didn't specify the friend or city. (I'm actually in California with my grandparents, but I didn't tell her that so her relationship with them wouldn't worsen). My mom has texted me a few times since I've left to check on me. She texted me about a week ago asking why I'm deciding to transfer and why I won't tell her where I am or who I'm with. I responded by telling her that I've told her where I am (Alabama) and she doesn't know the friend I'm with, so it doesn't matter. All that matters is that I'm safe.   A couple of hours later, my stepdad texts me a paragraph going off on me for not responding to my mother. He said I'm being insensitive and that she was upset by my actions. He said, “I don't understand why you'd spring your relocation on us like this. You've hurt your mother greatly and it's impacting all of us. You know I can't do much after my surgery and your brother can't drive to his events yet. Why won't you just give us the information? Can you answer that??\" I told my mom I was transferring in June as that's when I decided I would transfer. As for the remainder of the text, notice that he doesn't care about my mom — he's more worried about himself. I have not responded, but I have instead blocked him again.   No one in my family, except Alexia, has texted me since. My partner believes I'm in the right for doing so, but my friends believe I should just talk to them already because \"Blood is thicker than water.\" I corrected them on the saying and they got upset with me, but still believe I should suck it up, unblock my stepdad, and give them answers to their questions. I don't want to and I'd much prefer to keep my parents at a physical and emotional distance since they've been emotionally distanced from me for the last 5 years.\n",
      "Disclaimer, English is my second language, so I’m sorry for my bad grammar.  A little context: My sister and her husband are living in different countries. Her husband is in the USA and she is in the same country as me (our home country). They recently had a child, while my sister was in the US, then she moved back to our home country and refuses to live with her husband in US (this is a story of its own). Her husband is covering every financial aspect of her life, so she doesn’t need to work.  The story: Few months ago my sister had a baby, a wonderful little angel. At first everything seemed to be ok, she was a good mother and was taking a good care of the baby.  First thing she did that was a bit alarming for me, is that she hired a babysitter. I was a bit confused/worried about this, because my sister doesn’t have a job or any other thing to do rather than taking care of her baby and enjoying the precious time she got with her. So I thought she might be having some post-pregnancy issues and she needs a little help.  But then, she started taking driving lessons and was planning to get a driver’s license. Later she told me, that she is planning to buy a car, and to my question of why she even need a car she answered that it’ll be more convenient to go to places with a baby with her own car rather on a taxi. Please take into account, that she basically hasn’t got any place to go, this isn’t out of sheer necessity.  So I told her, that it’s irresponsible from her side to put her baby in dangerous situations (traffic is really bad her) without a valid reason. And when the argument heated up I told her that it’s not ok to not care for your own child’s safety and at an instant she put her child in the car, I’ll call the child protection services on her and will make sure that they investigate wether she is mentally capable of taking care of the baby. She knows that I wasn’t joking, as I’m not impulsive person and don’t talk out of emotions.  We haven’t talked since, and I don’t really feel bad for what I’ve said, but I’m thinking maybe I’m overreacting?  Edit: I see a lot of comments saying that I’m the asshole, and I agree that it very well might be true. I just want to add that my country is in top 3 of road accidents mortality in the world , and driving a car here is a REAL danger.  Also this was actually the first time I ever had such serious argument with my sister, just because I found that decision incredibly irresponsible.\n",
      "Hi all, I recently that a close friend of mine was accused of sexual harassment.  To give a bit of backstory I recently transferred to new college and he was one of the first first friends I made and we became really close.  However it came to my attention that prior to me meeting him, he was accused of sexual harassment. So this wasn't something I knew until about a week ago and I haven't talked to him sense.  He's made comments towards me that other people have seen as inappropriate, but I always brushed it off as he was just awkward.  Am I the asshole for cutting him off temporarily and what should do moving forward?\n",
      "My (26F) and my sisters (36F) grandmother passed away on January 1st of this year. We never got to say goodbye to her because I was in a different state and my uncle wouldn't allow my sister to talk to her, even on the phone. (That's too much to get into now) It took about a month for my uncle and the VA to get things rolling for a funeral, but we eventually got a date. My sister and I live somewhat close (about 45 minutes) to each other, but our grandmother lived about 5 hours away from us. Our plan was for me and my boyfriend (29M) to meet my sister at her house a day before the funeral and drive down with her young son and our cousin and stay at a hotel. Apparently I forgot to tell some of the details to my boyfriend because my sister wants to leave in the afternoon but my boyfriend doesn't get off  work til 4 or 5 pm (he works from home), and he thought we were leaving straight from our house instead of 45 minutes out of our way to drive down to the hotel. I ended up telling my sister that there was a miscommunication on my part, I apologized and told her my boyfriend and I will be driving down later in the evening. My sister ended up blowing up at me, saying that my boyfriend never met our grandmother and asked why he's even coming. I said he's there for moral support and that I wanted him there. She then went on about how I'm now gonna give all my attention to him instead of her when this is obviously a hard time for her. I kept telling her that that's not the case, but she kept telling me I am putting my partner before my family. Now I feel like a total jerk for even thinking of bringing my boyfriend and my boyfriend asked if he should even go now. I'm not sure how else to de-escalate this situation. I've already apologized a few times and told her there's nothing else i can really do at this point. so aita?\n",

They sent a 17 yo son to a small, expensive private university in TX. We live in FL and offered to go meet him at the airport and help him set up his dorm. The parents made no plans for him. He stayed with us in our hotel for 3 days until move in day. He had $1000 cash and a list of needs.Towels, bedding, food, books, school supplies, groceries, water,  the latest model iPhone, the latest apple ear pods, clothing but also set aside $200 and open a bank account for him. I’m a patient, resourceful person, a fairly good budget shopper.  I stayed an extra two days to help the nephew. The list never ended.  He got through his first semester. His father “wished” he stay with us starting in “the summer.” During Covid. No return ticket, no limitation on the stay- no clarification.  We live in a  2 bedroom, 1200 sq ft apartment . The second bedroom is not set up for guests- it is my office. It is also terribly close to our bedroom, the bedroom of newlyweds trying to start their own family.   I paid for the wedding, I paid for everything since my spouses income is...extremely limited. I’ve paid for $4000 in immigration fees. I pay 80% of our living expenses- and somehow I keep food on the table and gas in the car. But feeding, sheltering and entertaining  a 17 year old boy 24/7 for an unspecified length of time too?  When the mother gave our dogs jobs and instructions, I put my foot down. I said, we’re not paying this kid’s phone bill anymore and he’s not staying here.   He stayed with his Aunt and cousins in NY from April to October.   He had a ticket to go back home to Nigeria for Christmas break. He missed his flight. He was “heartbroken” and “really looking forward to going back.”  I’ve seen on video calls that school put at least 50lbs of flesh on him. He’s been living well on campus with an unlimited budget for the dining plan and school activities. He has friends and invites and lots of stuff to do.  I was asked to be “humble” and host for Christmas break. For family, for Christmas- I sat through a solid thirty minute tongue lashing by a resentful SIL. I offered our home for the holidays.   No card or wedding gift from any Nigerian relatives. They have a large gated estate in Lagos, three cars, domestics, two senior management salaries. We have two bicycles, a 2006 Hyundai Azera, overpriced rent, and my disability pay to support us.  We get requests monthly for money from Nigerian friends and fam. My attitude is souring.  Reddit- Give it to me straight- what am I missing? AITA for thinking my in-laws are entitled, unrealistic parasites who use family ties as a way to get ahead? AITA if I tell them there are limits to what you can ask family?\n",
      "I (16F) live with a dog named Lola that my mom (53) impulsively bought 5 months ago. At first I was okay with this, as I found Lola cute, and I liked how much of a social and loving dog she was. Unfortunately, Lola quickly became a problem.  Our other dog is very well potty trained (which we did ourselves), and rarely has accidents. Lola on the other hand, had a very hard time being potty trained, and even after she seemingly got the gist of it, she still regularly has MASSIVE accidents. The entire 5 months she’s been here, all she does is make huge messes that take a very long time to clean up, and have accidents. Most of the time, I’m the one that has to clean up after her as well.  I don’t blame Lola because she’s still a puppy. I blame my mother. This is HER dog and she will not put aside the time to train her, or find and hire a trainer. The entire 5 months, I’ve begged and begged for my mom to take her to a trainer because her presence quickly got out of hand. I even did research myself and found multiple local dog trainers. The entire 5 months, my mom has been brushing it off, and saying that she’s too busy with her full time job, and taking care of us.  My last straw was two days ago, when after work, I discovered that Lola went crazy and destroyed every single one of my plants outside, and inside. I had about 35 plants in total, not counting the three in my room (Which are all I have left). They were all growing so well and abundant. So much fucking time, effort, passion, and care wasted. My plants were everything to me. They were the one thing that I felt like I had to myself, and they were just MY THING. I loved them so much, I talked to them every single day, telling them how much I loved them and how beautiful, and abdundant they were, and now they’re just gone.  Immediately after I discovered my dead plants, I put my foot down and told my mom that I was done with this dog until she gets trained, and even suggested that we give her away since we obviously can’t train her like she needs to be. My mom basically shrugged off my statement and said I was being ridiculous and that “we’ll see”. Well I stuck to what I said and I haven’t taken her to the bathroom, fed her, or cleaned up after her in two days. Today, my mom came to talk to me and told me how inconsiderate I was being and that she needs help. She said she doesn’t have time to take care of Lola all the time and that she does “everything for me”. I stood my ground, and told her that she can receive help again when she’s trained and that this is not my dog, so it’s ultimately not my responsibility. She cussed at me, and slammed my door.  As I’m typing this, I can hear Lola rummaging through the trash can:)))AITA?\n",
      "Throwaway account.  So i know this woman who i personally think is very unfit as a mother. Im going to give the short version since I accidentally deleted my whole post before posting previously, here is a list of the reasons why i would be calling.  *she yells at the slightest peep he gives (he is very quiet and not very whiney) and blames it on not having enough weed or her mental health.  *she steals with him in her care.  *she leaves him in a stroller in the park while she has sex in the park.  *she spends all of her money on nail appointments, alcohol, weed, cocaine  *she has had 5 different boyfriends since he has been born, he isnt even a year old and all have been his \"Daddy\"  *she leaves him unsupervised to smoke weed or do cocaine  *she has left her bong where he could get it (he can barely crawl and cant even walk) and has come back to him rolling in bong water and broken bong glass   *she just moved in with her boyfriend of 3 months who is a heavy cocaine user  *she is always a different combination of stoned, drunk, or high, and when she is sober, she shrieks at her son.  If i were to call child protective services, he would be under the custody of his grandmother where his sister is, so he would not be in the system  I have no personal problem with this mother, i just stopped hanging out with her due to her toxicity.  I am having second thoughts since Christmas is so close, but I also worry for the wellbeing of this child.  Would I be the asshole if i anonymously tipped off Child Protective Services? She is on their radar but keeps having her file reopened and closed. (She is always lying and hides things)  UPDATE: I have called CPS and informed them of what was going on.\n",
      "About 8 months ago, I befriended a new coworker named Eliza at the restaurant I work as a hostess at.  A couple of months into Eliza working with me, I was the first one to arrive at work as I was scheduled an hour before her time to arrive. When she got there, I smiled and asked how she was doing, fully expecting her to respond like she always did with a positive answer. Instead she just glared at me and said nothing. I was confused and asked if something was wrong and again, got nothing but an angry stare. I decided to just leave her alone as she was obviously unhappy with something or someone, and I didn’t want to get involved and/or make however she was feeling worse. We ended up not speaking for the entire 4 hour shift.  This ended up going on for TWO week’s, the stares, silence during the shift and heavy sighs whenever I would speak to her. She also began to not cooperate with me work wise. We are hosts, communication is key! The last day of the two weeks, I eventually just said “Okay, Eliza... What’s going on? I was shocked when she responded with a giggle and said “really? you don’t know why? of course!” and then she laughed again. I was feeling so defeated and got our GM involved because I couldn’t even do my job correctly, plus I just wanted my friend back.   The GM pulled us aside and she finally told me what was wrong, and this is where things gets irrational. Eliza proceeds to explain to my manager and myself that she was working a double shift one day, and how I got sent home instead of her because of how the schedule was made. Basically she was mad at our manager for a scheduling error, and she wanted a break that was longer than an hour. But instead of going and speaking with the manager, she gets mad at me and doesn’t tell me why for TWO WEEKS. I was so tired of having an issue with a coworker that I just accepted her apology and moved on.  So about 6 months ago, I was about to leave work once Eliza got there because she was taking my spot as she was the night shift hostess and I was ending the morning shift. She came in ten minutes late, looking flustered and tired. She didn’t say hello or smile as she walked past me to clock in. I asked if she was okay and she said she was fine, just tired. Eliza sends a text that says “so you didn’t clean the windows last night. thanks alot for that, now I have to do it.”   I respond to Eliza’s text, saying that I did clean the windows. She accused me of being a liar and lazy and just not doing my job. So I finally stood up for myself. I told her that I was tired of how she treats me, and how irrational and rude she is for no reason. I told her that I am done being her friend because I can’t deal with her attitude. She got really mad, cussed at me, told me that no one at work likes me anyway and everyone talks about how bad I am at my job. I then told her to leave me alone to which she replies, “see you at work :)”\n",
      "My SIL and my sister have been married for five years. My SIL was a man (I'm sorry if this is bad phrasing) at the time, and started transitioning a few months into the marriage. My sister's not into women, so they considered divorce, but decided they would stay together, anyway.  Now that SIL has done reassignment surgery, my sister is not attracted to her at all, and my SIL admitted that that was okay as she's realized she's not into women either.  My sister has been going through a lot of emotional turmoil for the past five years, so even though SIL originally contributed most of the money towards buying their house, my sister is the one living in it with their cat and dog. I think that's only fair.  The only trouble is, SIL lost her job because of covid, and all her family is in her home country, so I offered to let her stay at my place. I've always gotten on well with her, and although I believe she's put my sister through a lot of pain, it's a bad situation and I generally try to lend a hand when I can.  My sister is now LIVID. She's told the rest of the family, and they all agree it seems like I'm picking sides...honestly, I'm on my sister's side, but I just don't hate my SIL for it. I can see where this seems like I'm picking sides, though, as their divorce process hasn't exactly been cordial. My sister has also been implying I'm taking favours from SIL in exchange for her living there, which is so ridiculous, but my parents have been telling me that as a young man, the arrangement is pretty inappropriate considering SIL likes men and still hasn't had a relationship with one. AITA?\n",
      "AITA in this scenario?  A now former friend went out of country for 3 weeks, and left me to watch her plants (at my place and hers) and check the mail. During this same time, I was dealing with my aunt and uncle's hospitalization and dying within 2 weeks of each other (happened while she was already gone) and cleaning out their apartment. I watered the plants, but apparently not well enough. I admittedly forgot about the mail, and apologized for it.  I received a message from her three weeks later saying she was upset, that I was either lying about watering the plants (wasn't, but as I didn't video watering them, can't prove it. They're still alive), or I shouldn't have agree to take on the family obligation with her plants being previously agreed to watch.  Also, I fart and smoke, so we can't be friends now (seriously, I have screenshots).  AITA for not bothering to try and save this friendship? I'm of the mindset that if she honestly believes I'm a liar, or that a family obligation isn't more important, than she's not who I thought she was. And yes, we did try to talk it out - the above information is the end result of our discussion (including me honestly saying do you really think I'm lying to you over plants?)\n",
      "My in laws had an early Halloween party on Sunday because some family members will be travelling on actual Halloween. There were many people invited, think a weird cross between Halloween/ Christmas / bbq and that’s basically what it was.   There were a few unfamiliar faces, but not too many. I’ve been married for 7 years to my husband and we have a 5 y/o lil boy who’s overall very happy, bright, and confident. There was a lady who I’d never seen before and we ended up sitting next to each other outside as the party had spilled onto the decking. She sat down next to me asking a hundred questions about my son, his teeth (??), why he has long hair (because he likes it?) and why I was allowing him to pick food off his dads plate (because we love our son and are a close family...?) My son came running up to me after a few mins and said ‘daddy is calling you’   The reason why my husband didn’t come over himself is because he was sitting next to his very very ill and elderly aunt who actually introduced us. She was holding his hand smiling because she hadn’t seen him in a while and he was calling me over because she’d asked after me.   After I returned the lady said ‘you ought to home school your boy. He’s got some nerve talking to you the way he did.’ I was surprised and said excuse me? He wasn’t at all rude or anything. She repeated herself and pointed to her child, who had been going  nuts  running around other kids and said ‘she’s polite and knows how to talk to adults.’   I must admit by the time this happened I was onto my second glass of wine, so I screwed up my nose and said ‘thanks but no thanks, I find the idea of home schooling weird, and my son knows perfectly well how to talk to people’   She immediately spluttered and tried to defend her position, saying ‘I’m only trying to help!’, but by this point I decided to walk off because she was really gearing up and already spouting about statistics and Christianity etc etc.   I think I’ll probably be called TA but let’s give it a whirl. My husband is 100% on my side but my MIL got a phone call about my ‘improper behavior’ and she wants me to Facebook friend this lady to apologize.\n",
      "So, to cut a long story short, I've been living on my own for years and love having privacy and my own space. (I'm an introvert and a very private person). Recently a friend lost his house and life savings due to an investment gone bad, and found himself needing a room. He asked (almost begged) to rent my guest bedroom, and although I didn't want to take on a boarder, I felt sorry for him so I reluctantly agreed.  A few days after he moved in, I've had enough already. I have no privacy anymore. I had a boarder in the past and he was working full-time and would go out a lot and when he was home he kept to himself, staying mostly in his room playing playstation, studying or watching tv. It was great. This new boarder is ALWAYS around. He works part time so is home a lot and when he is he's always hovering in my living room, my dining room, watching my tv (he sold his when he moved in), wanting to accompany me everywhere whenever I try to leave the house. He sees me grab the dog's leash and says \"I'll come for a walk with you.\" He sees me with my reusable shopping bags and says \"You're going shopping? I'll come with you.\" He sees me wearing my workout gear (I have a few pieces of exercise gear in the garage) he insists on working out too. I haven't had a moment to myself yet. It's only been a few days and I'm fed up already. The thing is, I had a feeling this was going to happen. As nice as my friend is, and he means well, but for the life of him he cannot take a hint. He'll often invite himself to tag along with whatever someone else is doing like if someone says they're going out for coffee or going to grab a bite to eat, and most people (including myself) are too polite to say no, because other than that he's a really nice guy. It wouldn't be a huge deal for most people but I'm an extremely private person and just want a couple of hours to myself in my own home on my days off (I work full-time but do long shifts so have 7 days off each fortnight but he always seems to be around) ... WIBTA if I asked him to either go out or stay in his room for an hour or two on my days off, just to give me some space? I can't even play my playstation (a much loved hobby) because he's always watching my tv. I know he'll be offended but it's only been a few days and I'm pissed off already...\n",
      "Due to recent events, a trip that I (22F) had planned to France with 5 of my friends (22F) in May was cancelled. I was really looking forward to going on this vacation, as I have never been abroad before. I bought my flights last June for this date for $800, and am not expecting to see a refund from the airline, as they are only allowing people to rebook flights; not receive a refund. I also put down $300 for my part of hotel/airbnb expenses.   When the trip got cancelled, I made it abundantly clear that I would not be able to rebook for Labor Day weekend due to an important work conference. My friends rebooked the trip during that week anyways, despite having open availability because labor day weekend is a 3 day weekend and they wanted to go in early September. I was bummed I couldn't go, but now my friends will not chip in and refund me my $300 for lodging. It does not seem fair that I've lost out on money for a trip I can no longer go on, for hotels that I will not be staying in.  I have asked that everyone pay me back for the cost of the hotel. It would be 60 dollars a person, but they still will not refund me. They say it's not their responsibility to pay me back for a trip I can not go on.  AITA for pressing to get my money back?  TLDR; my friends and I booked a trip that was cancelled. When rebooking, they did not consider my schedule for new dates. Now they won't reimburse me for hotel costs,.\n",
      "this happened about a month ago, but it came up in conversation at work and wanted other opinions since one of my coworkers called me a bitch for doing so.  i had a coupon for 25 cents off per gallon for a holiday gas station that was going to expire the next day, so i went and got gas (that i very much needed anyway). for information, this gas station wasn't small. there are roughly  6 sets of gas/diesel pumps with 4 pumps per set, one of those in the set being a diesel pump. i pulled into the nearly empty station to the first pump i see. i start pumping my gas when shortly after, a woman pulled up behind me. she was pulled up in front of one of the diesel pumps. she didn't get out of her vehicle to start pumping, and her car wasn't one that used diesel anyway, so i wasn't really sure why she was there. i didn't think too much of it and i went inside to pay, since i couldn't use my coupon at the gas pump.   i come back out and she's still sitting there behind me. i go back into my car and start preparing to pull away. directly next to the pump i was at is the driveway to pull onto the main road to leave. the gas station is on the corner of a busy intersection with stoplights, so if there are cars waiting for the light to turn on the road, you can't pull out of the driveway without hitting them.  as i was about to leave, a truck with a large trailer was also driving to the driveway to leave, but the light was red and there were cars in the way, so this truck/trailer was stopped directly in front of me, causing me not to be able to go anywhere. as i waited, the woman behind me starts honking her horn repeatedly and when i looked out my rear-view mirror, she was making a shooing motion with her hand for me to move, even though there was clearly a large truck/trailer in front of me. she wouldn't stop holding down the horn even though there wasn't anything for me nor the truck/trailer driver to do.  out of spite, i decided to get out of my car and grab one of those window squeegee things and start washing all of my windows, even though they weren't dirty. i took my time with washing and wiping off each window while she still continued to honk at me. the truck/trailer eventually got to pull out and i got to merge onto the main road, but i made sure to wave and blow a kiss to the woman behind me. while i was waiting at the stoplight myself, she was pumping her gas normally at the pump i was at.  am i the asshole for doing that? my mom and bf thought it was funny, but my coworker tonight said i was being bitchy and that maybe the woman had to use the pump i was at specifically. all of the gas pumps (other than the diesel ones; idk how those really work) had the different fuel options on them, so it's not like my pump stood out in anyway.\n",
      "I (49 f) and my husband (45 m) are falling out because I have said I want a cat.  We have been married 17 years and have one daughter (15) who lives with us and I have a daughter (24) from a previous relationship that doesn't live with us.  When we met I had 2 cats. They lived to grand old ages of 21 years or so (both rescues) and the youngest only died 4 years ago. My husband loved the cats.  Throughout our marriage we have also had dogs and currently have 2 staffy's who we all adore. I have had cats all my life until the last 4 years without one and I really want to get another one. The cat I want belongs to my eldest daughter who has a number of cats but the cat in question is being bullied by the others and is really unhappy. It is also a jet black cat, which tend not to do so well getting rehomed from rescue centres.  We live in a rural area, no roads nearby and plenty of fun for a cat to be had as we live in the woods.  I have tried to discuss this with my husband and he has stated NO. We are not getting a cat. He doesn't want one and feels that his word goes.  AITA for putting my foot down and insisting? I am a 49 year old woman and I feel like he is being controlling in thinking he has the final say.   It really is a cause of contention. Usually we can reach an agreement but I feel like I am being dictated to, but now I am questioning myself whether IATA for insisting on getting the cat.   I feel like I shouldn't have to ask permission in a partnership for something I feel so strongly about.\n",
      "First post, longish time lurking, and I’m on mobile.   I’m 30f and my cousin 25f is getting married tomorrow and she asked me to be in the wedding as a bridesmaid in 2019. I’ve had tattoos for more than 10 years, and the wedding was panorama-postponed indefinitely last year. I finished a half sleeve in March of this year and then the wedding was rescheduled in May for tomorrow.  A little background; I’m much shorter than the other bridesmaids, much paler and am fairly muscular. I’m proud of who I am, but I’ve never really fit in to my cousin’s insta-worthy lifestyle. I’m okay with that, but I will stand out, especially since we are all wearing the exact same dress that my cousin picked.   Today she called me and asked if I had time to find and buy enough concealer to cover all of my tattoos because this is going to be a “VERY traditional wedding” (it’s a black tie event at a well known 5 star hotel in our area). The thing is…. I don’t have enough time/funds to purchase enough tattoo-specific concealer. And honestly I don’t want to.   I told her it made me uncomfortable, and she again emphasized how “traditional” the wedding is going to be. My cousin suggested I wear a shawl or scarf. I think that would make me “stand out” even more.   AITA if I refuse to cover my tattoos for my cousin’s wedding?  Small edit: I’ve realized in some of the comments that the use of “traditional” was congruous with conservative. My cousin meant it would be extremely “elegant”.  UPDATE: Thank you all for your comments and advice, especially given the immediacy of the AITA?   I had called my mom in hopes of some advice too. She told me, after 35 years of having this shelf hold her scarves and belts, it broke three days ago. She found this BEAUTIFULLY bordered hand tatted lace kind of triangle shawl thing. She brought it with her to the venue. I WISH I could make this up, but I swear I recognize it as our (mine and my cousin’s) grandma’s.   I think I’ve found a good compromise. The lace shawl that honors our grandma. But ALSO, I’m totally wearing my converse to the reception for some dancing!\n",
      "My mom and my wife typically get along fine. I think they might find each other a bit annoying, but she isn't one of those MILs you read about. We just don't see much of her as no one in the family is close.   I have an aunt who hates my guts. She is mad because when she disowned her son I gave him some money. This led to a huge fight where my aunt and wife said nasty things to each other. My mom didn't get involved, but at the end of the day I do believe she loves her sister more than any of her children. My dad made it known that he was on my aunt's side, and as a result my wife's relationship with him soured.  Anyway my mom offered to crochet my wife a bathing suit cover up. The pattern required black and yellow for sunflowers, and then you could pick the base. My wife picked lavender. my mom came over the other day to give my wife the coverup as a birthday gift. It was blue instead of purple. My mom said she hopes the blue is ok but my aunt demanded the same coverup in purple, but did not want to match with my wife \"because she hates you\"  I asked my mom what the fuck was wrong with her to phrase it like that. My mom seemed confused and said it was true ad we had to know she hated us. My mom apologized and said she hopes she likes it, but at the end of the day she is going to put her sister first.   I lost it and told her she was being a bitch to my wife and she can't disrespect my wife in our home. i told her to get out. she looked shocked but left, and went crying to my dad who left me a long voicemail cussing me out. Now my entire family is furious because they feel she didn't do anything wrong and it was a don't shoot the messenger situation. I've been called entitled for even implying she should prioritize my wife over her sister (which I don't think I did) and apparently my mom is pissed because my wife posted a picture wearing the coverup, and it was \"entitled\" to wear it after kicking her out of the house.\n",
      "I (F 24) I gradually became friend with another employee (F, 26) from my company. Our friendship took a real turn when, at the same time, she broke up with her boyfriend (been living together for 3 years) and I lost a family member in an accident. We supported each other and started to spent a huge amount of time together at work and after work.  My friend, who wanted to change job after being in the company for a while, got a job opportunity in a big city that is 1 hour away from where we live.  We were a bit sad to not be able to do as much together as before, but planned a lot of stuff to do on weekends when we'll visit each other.  The day before she started her new job, I wished her good luck and asked her to let me know how it went after work. She said thank you but never really kept me updated. I sent another text a few days later to have some news and she didn't open it. After two weeks, I started to loose patience and sent a passive-aggressive text to say that I didn't get why she ignored me but that I was planning to go to her city to see a group of friends we have in common and that we would be super happy if she joined us. I was honestly too angry to text as if nothing happened but also wanted to see her as I miss our friendship a lot, and expected to talk to her about that. She answered that she never ignored me but was super occupied with the new job, overwhelmed, and couldn't do anything about it and that she was planning to answer when things will be more calm. I immediately felt bad for her and answered that I completely understood and that I'll wait for some news when she will have more time. She never texted again. Yesterday, a friend from the group told me that she texted her to say she was super angry at me and that I was super rude to point out that she ignored me because she was struggling with her new job.   So, AITA for insisting to have some news after two weeks of complete silence?\n",
      "My husband (30m) and I (29f) both work in public service. We are both underpaid (but pretty evenly) which is typical in our area for our professions. We were talking about money the other night and he mentioned me picking up a second job. I got really mad. I’m a full time working mom to a 14 month old. The time that I have “off” is spent caring for our child, running errands, taking care of the home, etc. I snapped and told my husband he needs to get a different job. He got mad and was going on and on about how much he loves his job. But he’s 9 years in, and I’m making the same as he is with only 2 full years in. There is no raise or advancement in sight for him in the near future. He loves his job and he’s really good at it. But I feel like him asking me to pick up a second job (in reality it would be more like a 3rd job), is really selfish. He’s had several opportunities arise outside of his field that offer significantly more than what he makes now and he keeps turning them down because he “wouldn’t enjoy it”. I told him that if money is that big of a problem, then he needs to buck up and take a higher paying job especially when they keep being offered. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "Bear with me, my English is shit. And I also posted this somewhere else.  So the short version is that we were best friends, known each other for about 5 years, no romance etc involved, but we were still close, we dated different people and still remained close friends during that time. But I am single rn and she got a boyfriend and I dont know the guy but he told her to cut contact with me or otherwise he will leave her. He is controlling and maybe jealous but she loves him so she kind of gave in and communication between me and her is at a bare minimum.  I havent seen her in 4 months and she says she cant meet me because of him. She doesnt want to lose him but she still sees me as her best friend and doesnt want to completely give up our friendship. She knows that I am not and never will be a threat to her relationship but she still accepts her BFs demands.  I honestly don't know what to make of this. Should I confront her and then move on, or let things just stay where they are and move on or keep \"fighting\" for my friend.  I am feeling a lot things. I don't want to bother her and want her to be happy. And then I am angry that someone is controlling her in this way. I want to get her back as my best friend but I would never want to damage her relationship.  She said that her BF needs time to understand that she doesnt want to give up the friendship we had. But this is going on for months now and I feel like shit, tbh.  What do you think of this? AITA for not moving on?\n",
      "(Sorry for any mistakes my English isn’t great) I 26f gave birth to my daughter almost a week ago and since I kept the name private no one said anything except my cousin R 22f making guesses. She is also pregnant (due in a month). And her dad just told her the name which is after my sister K who passed away in a car accident some years ago.  It’s the same name but with a slight different spelling. (Still common and not ridiculous)  My cousin apparently wanted dibs on Ks name but never said anything because was also keeping the name a surprise (it’s quite a common thing in my culture that we keep baby names as a secret) She’s called me several times to remind me K isn’t my real sister (technically we’re step sisters but I never thought of her that and we were so close) and to help me consider changing the name name to a similar name.  First I told her that our kids can have the same name or that she can use the similar name but she still texts me so I blocked her and when she rang me from her dads phone to call me a rude bitch I replied that she was the bitch and that she couldn’t come to see my daughter if she was going to continue to convince me to change her name.  Now I feel I could be an asshole because she’s told our family who said that I took it too far not letting her see my baby and that I should understand she’s acting this way because she’s pregnant and hormonal which I obviously sympathies with but I think she’s exaggerating it? I don’t think she’s so hormonal that she needs to demand my babies name for her daughter. AITA\n",
      "This is going to sound silly, but it’s somewhat weird for me, maybe because I’m reading too much into it.   So my uncle visited us yesterday, and he decided to shower in my room. I (15f) have an attached bathroom, and all my sisters and brothers' room have it too. The problem here is guests usually shower in the guest room or the extra bathroom we have.   I personally hate people entering my room(except my mom) because that’s my private place and the only place I feel comfortable, or maybe it’s also because I hate socializing with people and prefer staying in my room. When I refused to let him enter my room and told him to shower in the guest room, he was like, “OP, I prefer your room because it smells nice and comfortable.” I found this comment weird but couldn’t argue more because it’s not my house.   After he left, I told my sister about this and how I felt weird that he’s entering my private space. My sister called me TA for judging him for something so small.   I came to this conclusion, maybe because I read too many crime stories and stuff. So I just want to make sure I’m not TA and was being reasonable. It’s okay if you all think I’m TA because it helps me to understand this situation better.   Thank you.\n",
      "Everyone loves a compliment but omg I’m getting upset they keep complimenting me cuz I’m not wearing my glasses anymore. They say hey girl you’re so pretty. It’s like a backhanded compliment. Are people telling me I wasn’t pretty before with my glasses? So when I say thank you but then respond with you didn’t think I was pretty before? Then they look shocked and try to explain and say of course but you just look different and it’s a good different. Am I the asshole for not just accepting the compliment and making people feel bad for doing it?\n",
      "This is pretty fresh and probably gonna need an update, but here's what's going on:  I attended Mardi Gras with my bf and his family, and he ordered this GIGANTIC Modelo bottle and we all decided to share it.  We were all taking videos and pictures with this giant Modelo, and I posted a video of me taking a sip from it on Snapchat.  Now, I have my mom added on some of my other social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), And I understand that I have to be careful of what I post bc she works for our church, and whatever I post will reflect on her.  That's not the case in Snapchat, however. I dunt even know how she got my Snapchat. The only people I have on my Snapchat are my friends, cousins, and siblings, aka people around my age. I don't have any of my mom's friends, and my story is also private.  But I had saw that she took a screenshot of me taking a sip of that big Modelo.  I think this is very out of line. I specifically use my snap to post things on my own accord without having to worry about judgement from my mom or her acquaintances.   I sent her a screenshot of Snapchat telling me that she screenshotted the video, and I asked her what it was about, and now she's like \"I want to talk about what you posted.\"  I feel like I deserve some privacy, also I'm an adult. I'm 21.  I can drink.   I unadded her off my Snapchat, but I just feel like she's tripping big time.  UPDATE: We talked, and it played out exactly how I thought it would. She doesn't agree with me posting what I post on social media, which is fine, but she starting raising her voice at me when I started voicing my concerns to her.   Like, I get that she's my parent and she has her right to her opinion on what I should do, but I'm an adult now, and I think she's taking my adult decisions WAY too personally.\n",
      "20F, in Uni. Over weekend, I filmed some insignificant video of my friend & I doing a dance with a jump& twirl at a house party. posted it on snapchat.  Later, I get a sc response to my video from a guy who I’d gone to highschool with, call him J. J told me that I had a nice body. I replied thanks.J continued& said, “being able 2 watch [your breasts] jiggle is so satisfying”. I decided to let J know that he had made me uncomfortable. after I told J,  he got defensive, &told me “how can u get mad at me when u want the attention”   I told him then that I was not asking for attention. This is when J starts calling me a whore, slut, hoe, &saying that all I want is attention &that’s what he was giving me, the attention whore I am. I told J that I can post whatever I like just as he can, and that I am not whatever terms he had been calling me. I told J that he can’t “get with“ any girls because he make them uncomfortable. J regardless said I was being a hoe, acting like a bitch, etc, all because I had told him what he said made me uncomfortable.   I block him from my snapchat, screenshot the conversation we had, and I post this on my private instagram account, with barely any followers, mostly just close friends. I did not hide his identity, only posting HIS messages that he had sent to ME. I learned through my female followers that he has persistently asked them for nudes, they didn’t feel comfortable being alone with him, etc. Made me see he was all-around not a nice guy.   A couple days go by and I hadn’t thought much of it since, but another guy, called C, from my high school decides to message me and say what I did to J was “super fucked up” and “humiliating” and cyber-bullying”. C continues to tell me that J was just trying to get laid, like I would care to know, and that I need to “grow up” and “mature” and “let it go because it happens all the time.” I only posted a screenshot  where I was “cyber-bullied” first, he did all the humiliating when he calling me a whore and such after I rejected his uncomfortable advances. So, I just showed my friends. Why is he humiliated by making this conversation public if he feels he did no wrong? . The guy’s supporter told me that i’m acting like “i’m the only woman this has ever happened to” that’s another reason I decided to post it. I know women can be made uncomfortable by actions and comments of some men. Why must I ignore it& let it slide so he can just keep doing it? Why must my behavior change so he’s comfortable making me uncomfortable?  It was a small comment, I would have dropped it if he had stepped back after I told him it made me uncomfortable.  AITA for posting screenshots on my private account that made me uncomfortable and refusing to apologize or take it down?  EDIT: Thank you all so much for the answers! I guess I was second guessing myself, but I realize that I told him it made me uncomfortable and he decided to be aggressive about it, and that behavior is unacceptable and needed to be called out. Thank you all for the love and support!! Happy to know there’s people out there who know what’s worth speaking up about.\n",
      "Last year I had a roommate named S. It ended really badly. Basically, S overstayed her welcome and also tried to move her boyfriend in, without consulting me and without offering more rent. She left, but during that time, I had another friend, named R, that I used to vent to about the situations with my roommate. R knew all the things that frustrated me about S. After S moved out, it was just me with my 2 kids and my now-husband. We had just started enjoying our privacy as a family without extra people living with us. Shortly after, R was evicted and immediately asked me if she and HER boyfriend could sleep on my couch for a few months since she knew I had the space available again. She KNEW how I felt about roommates and I started to realize that she was the one amping me to kick out my other roommate just to make room for herself. I told her hell no and have not spoken to her since. I hope she's okay but I couldn't tolerate being taken advantage of again.\n",
      "I (20M) am an art student at a state school. I recently switched from science so I’ve been exploring all kinds of art wishing to get better. Lately, I’ve been wanting to get better at painting people, as human features are really difficult and I wanted to practice.  I had this idea for a painting of a couple surrounded by purple flowers under an orange sky. The meaning of this is irrelevant, the only relevant is that these symbols have a lot of meaning to me. (My art is very expressive) Anyways, I needed models and I was telling this friend about it and she said that she and her boyfriend could model for me. Note: I NEVER suggested I would make a painting for them. I was very happy and I told her I would thank them by buying them dinner or something. Anyways, I finished the painting and I must say it’s absolutely beautiful. And yes, it looks really romantic. I sent my friend a picture and she loved it, but then texted me asking when she could pick it up. I was confused and asked her why she wanted to pick it up, that she could come see it but I didn’t feel comfortable with anyone taking my art. We had this argument where she said that the painting was theirs, it was romantic and they were the people in it so it should belong to them. While I am genuinely thankful for the 15mins they posed while I photographed them, the painting is mine. I never suggested I would give it to them, and I’m the one who spent 20 hours on it. She’s not talking to me and she’s suggesting people that I manipulated her and her boyfriend and stole a painting. All my artist friends think I’m on the right as they understand how personal art is, but several of my other friends think this painting means a lot more to them than to me and I should give it to them, as some believe that the model automatically has the right over the art. I think (and in the future I will) I should’ve clarified much more strongly that they would just be models and would not be getting the painting. But I wasn’t dishonest, and I don’t think I’m innthe wrong for keeping my painting. So AITA?  Edit: many people are asking if I’d compromise and give her a nice photo and a print of the painting. I did send her a nice photo (the one that’s going to my portfolio), and I offered to get her a print. She then suggested that she gets the painting and I get the print. Lmao  Edit 2: several people have suggested I modify the painting. As petty as I am, I currently like my painting much more than I dislike the situation, so I think I’ll keep it as it is. Also, yes, I already bought them dinner way before I finished the painting. Some people also want to know why I’d keep a romantic painting of someone else. Well, the painting does cone off as very romantic — that’s easy to see. But it’s not a romantic painting to me (even though anybody else would think so). I use a relationship as a symbol that unites the other elements in my painting, which have great meaning. I see no romance in it even tho most people would.   I think I’ll take the suggestion to offer her to buy it. People have suggested a rate of $20/hr, + materials + personal fee just because I can and I’m honestly lowkey enjoying the situation. So I’ll tell her that she can have it for $650. (it is after all a very large painting)  I’m certain she won’t buy it, and I don’t expect her to. But now if I hear she’s telling people I refused to give her her painting, I can just say she refused to pay.   Honestly, at first I was sad she changed my perception of my painting, but I’ve now made some connections to some of the other elements in the painting and I like it even more. As I’ve admitted in the comments I can be real petty and instead of getting mad at the situation, I try to find enjoyment in it. Especially because I didn’t escalate anything. I just sat down and watched her throw a tantrum. Thank to all the people who congratulated me on my first commission :)  Edit 3: thanks to all the artists who’ve given me advise for the future on how to protect my art. I will definitely be way more explicit if working with models in the future so that this doesn’t happen again.\n",
      "Ok, I'm 24M and recently bumped into someone I knew from highschool at the grocery store. She was a year older than me and was a massive bully, would say the meanest things just to get a reaction. One of the things I remember the most is how one of my best friends at the time had a speech impediment and she would imitate the way he spoke all the time. She was also very popular, she'd act like her being absolute shit to others was \"just being honest\" and would always say the shit she did was just as a joke and people found it funny for some reason. Her senior year comes around and she gets knocked up. Suddenly she's the butt of her former friends' jokes and, well, I can't deny that a lot of us who got shit from her were happy to see her be the one getting shit for once. And, yeah, my friend group did specifically refer to her \"fall from grace\" as karma.  Anyways, she recognized me at the grocery story and goes to say hi. I'm not the person I was when I was in highschool, it's not like I believe she's the person she used to be, so although I was kinda freaked out that she was being friendly at first, we ended up making pretty nice conversation. At some point she brings up her senior year and says that it was a wake up call for her, I chuckled and said something along the lines of \"Yeah, we used to say it was karma.\" She got really pissed at that, started almost yelling in the middle of the store about how it was so fucked up to refer to a baby as karma and so I told her that I didn't actually think that, it was just bullshit we said when we were 16, and finally kind of calmed down and said that there was no reason for me to tell her that because it was just cruel. I just stared because I was still kind of in shock about the sudden change and she huffed and walked away. Been feeling kind of guilty about it all day, and I did enjoy talking to her, and part of me wants to dm her on Instagram or something to apologize, but I also am not entirely sure of having done anything that bad.  &#x200B;  Edit: I do want to make it clear that we were not referring to the baby itself being karma, just her treatment over it, and that she was talking about her treatment during senior year when I said that. She specifically went on this semi-long tangent about how being treated like shit because of being pregnant senior year was a wake up call to how awful the treatment she gave others was.\n",
      "Throw away account for privacy.  This is kind of a weird situation and I don’t know if I have the right to establish boundaries.  My boss let me move in to save money so I can move back to the major city next door after a nasty breakup from an abusive and toxic relationship. I’m moving out in March. I pay 525 dollars a month to live here and I pitch in for necessities. I also buy my own groceries. My boss expects me to wake up 6 hours before my 8 hour shift begins to feed the dogs, take out the trash, and once a week to clean the yard from their shit.   I take care of her house (she’s kind of a hoarder) and I’m organizing and decluttering. I take care of her animals, errands, paperwork, cleaning the house daily because it constantly gets messy, and make sure her daughter is fed, goes to school on time, and does her homework.   My point is she expects me to wake up to work 6 hours before my shift to do chores she has time to do herself. To add I’m also expected to feed everyone dinner after my shift ends. I never complain about making dinner because of her kindness of letting me stay here. It’s only sometimes as well. Back to the point, I have insomnia so I’m lucky to get 3 hours of sleep. I also can’t fall back to sleep if I wake up. She has told me that’s not her problem. She expects me to wake up at 7:15 every morning when i could wake up at 8-8:30 to feed the animals (they’ll literally be fine) and take the trash out if she just takes the dogs out at 7:15 herself. It takes 5 minutes.  AITA for wanting a little extra sleep when my 8 hr shift doesn’t start until 6 hours after she wakes me up? Just to do stuff that would take her 5 minutes? To add I always check off the boxes on my daily lists and then some. I could be the asshole because she let me move in when I had nothing.\n",
      "I [F22] recently graduated from college and have been able to land a nice job with a good salary and benefits. I also come from a very traditional Asian household so my parents have always stressed the importance of academics and helped pay for my college entirely which I am so grateful for.  I also identify as a Lesbian and decided to rip off the band-aid and come out to them ....and they were not happy in the slightest. They went on and on about how it was a lifestyle choice and \"just a phase\" and how I was such a disgraceful daughter and an embarrassment to the family. After that whole ordeal, I decided to talk to them a month later to see if things cooled off but now they want me to pay them back an equivalent amount of what they paid to put me through college and they said that since I have a good job I can afford to. They also said they didn't want their hard-earned money to go to waste by supporting \"like me\" and they went on and said some stuff that I can't even say. I told them I wanted to come to visit in person to see if we could sort this whole thing out which they obliged but that was a huge mistake. Once I came in they brought in this \"spiritual priest\" to read my astrological sign and he told me that what I'm feeling is temporary and this too shall pass and that I will \"bear many beautiful children\" and how I was \"destined for motherhood\".  I pretty much lost my temper and just lashed out in a moment of anger which usually isn't like me and I took the family dog with me and went back to my apartment. My mom has called me multiple times and said that she wanted me to return the dog and pay her back my college tuition and I've pretty much gone no contact. The main reason I decided to take the dog is that before college it was my dog but my parents ended up raising him while I was at college and have gotten very emotionally attached to him as well but they never walk him and he is now morbidly obese and I feel like they aren't taking optimal care of him even though they feed him well and love him. So, was I the AH in this situation because it technically still is their dog but we agreed that the dog would come with me as soon as I graduated but I feel bad for taking him away because they seem to be really attached him now.\n",
      "I work for a large oil change company, and today I had a bad experience with a coworker while being in charge of a bay. The coworker in question is a relatively new hire who recently passed his certification, and is generally pretty good at his job. He was working under the hood of the car while I talked to the customer about the extras that we can service on his car, there weren't many due as it was a 2021. I hear the bottom side tech and manager on duty say he's done, and the other guy starts pumping oil into the car. After he's done, he walks away, and I look under the hood. There's a large spill sitting on a cover piece of the engine, and per policy I ask him to clean it. For reference, we're supposed to leave cars as clean or cleaner than what they came in, even down to fingerprints. New guy says \"we aren't a cleaning service\" and walks away again. I quote policy and he tells me, loudly, to shut up. This is a huge breach in policy, made worse that it was in front of a customer. I apologize to the customer and clean the spill myself.   After all that I go to confront my coworker about the rudeness per my bosses request and he just continues to tell me to shut up and drop it. The manager on duty says he doesn't want to hear it and if I have a problem, talk to the boss. The boss will be resolving it tomorrow and will probably take my side, so I ask you reddit, am I the asshole for trying to get a coworker to clean a mess he made on a customer's car?\n",
      "So late November/ early December I broke up with my girlfriend of just under a year and a half, because I felt that we would be better off friends.   Sadly, I quickly realised I was wrong, and regretted doing it, which I told her just a few days after the break up.   After the break up we continued to message as we normally would, I met her a few times for coffee, and after a few weeks I asked her to be my girlfriend again, to which she said that she would need time to think about, which I thought fair enough, and the day after this I went on holiday with my family abroad so I couldn't really message her all that much.  When I arrived back from the holiday I had a series of messages from her drunkenly talking about how she wanted to and would be open to having sex with me again, but I didn't really reply because she was drunk and probably wouldn't remember.   After about a week had passed I asked her where her head was at and she said she felt if she said she wanted to get back together she would need to see more effort in the relationship. And this is mainly where the problem comes in.  I've tried on multiple occasions throughout the Christmas break to try and see her but everytime she either has work, which was not far from where I live,  \"couldn't be arsed\" and even one time saying she's free but doesn't want to, and then said that I wasn't putting in enough effort to show her I want to get back with her.  This caused us to have a slight argument, because I said that she has to meet me halfway when I'm trying to make effort, because I can't show it if I can't even see her. What she replied was that she doesn't want to spend time with me because she wants to see what it's like not being with me, since this was both our first real relationship. (Both 18 years old)  Now it's been nearly three weeks since I asked her to be my girlfriend again and I'm getting slightly more impatient with her and more snappy with my messages because still everytime I ask to see her she pretty much ignores that's I've asked  So I understand she needs time, but am I the asshole for getting fed up?\n",
      "My (26F) mom (45F) messaged me in October to let me know her and my two younger sisters & their husbands (21F, 23M, 24F, 34M) were going in together on a $400 3D printer for my father (46M) for Christmas. She said if I “wanted in” on this group gift to just “Venmo her” and they’d put my name on the from line too, she accompanied the message with “but seriously no pressure! You can totally do your own thing”   I have never sent a Christmas gift to anyone. I’ve spent one Christmas in the last nine years with my family of origin, and of course brought something small for each person. My family is Mormon and kicked me out when I was 17, I hadn’t done anything wrong I just came out of the closet about being an atheist. They didn’t want me around my siblings if I wouldn’t attend church.   I didn’t know how to respond, so I just said “ok, we are balling on a budget right now, but I want to contribute. I’ll Venmo you when my budget allows!”   Yesterday mom messaged me to ask for my address so she could send my partner and I a gift for Christmas. I sent her my address (She has my address, she sends an extended family news letter every month) My mom will generally send me $50 for Christmas and Birthdays, but lately has been sending other random stuff. It’s sweet of her to send anything at all, but not necessary. We aren’t close and I don’t expect it.   I provided my address and said we’d send something small as well.   The thing is, I’m pretty sure I’m not planning on sending anything. I feel like if I’m going to send money for the printer, I must also send gifts for all four siblings, my mother, my two brothers in law, and my nieces. And I really would love to do that, I just literally can’t, I’d have to leave people out, or go get thrifted gifts (which feels embarrassing, and weird to bother with shipping), or go into credit card debt.   My partner and I don’t do gifts for each other, or for my partners daughter (15F). Christmas isn’t important to any of us. None of us are Christian, and we ALWAYS spoil each other pretty big for birthdays with gifts and activities.   AITAH for committing to send gifts I don’t intend to send? Should I somehow budget harder when we are already spread thin to accommodate my moms assumption we’d send something this year?\n",
      "This is so petty. I apologize in advance for wasting your time reading this, but my coworker (that I am pretty close with) is refusing to talk to me now, and I just don’t understand why.   So, basically, she is the materials manager at my work and buys suppliers for the center. She, obviously, is reimbursed for this. Yesterday, she bought some winter themed window clings for me to decorate the front office with. Cool. While opening them, I discovered how weirdly they were designed. There were lots of tiny strange pieces that were hard to work with and easily torn. She walked out as I was decorating, and we had the following exchange:  Me: Look at how dumb these things were designed! How is anyone meant to work with them?  Her: (jokingly) Well I’m not going to buy them for you anymore if all you’re going to do is complain!  Me: (jokingly) Thats fine! Don’t buy them anymore then. You’re not the one having to work with the stupid things anyway!   Her:  staring blankly for a while  That was REALLY rude.  Then she walks off and hasn’t talked to me since. She’ll barely even look at me now.   I guess I’m just not totally sure why she would be mad at me, and I’m starting to wonder if she wasn’t really joking when she called me out for “complaining”. I mean, it’s work decor. I don’t really give a shit about it lol. Should I have been grateful? Was I really being an asshole? It’s not like she gifted me window clings out of the kindness of her heart or anything....and it’s not money out of her own pocket. Why would she be offended that I found the design of them to be stupid?  Am I really the asshole?\n",
      "A little background first. My sister married a guy who has children from a previous marriage one of which is autistic and non verbal. I have NO issues with autism as I am on the spectrum myself just higher functioning.   This happened like a year or so ago but I still think about it from time to time so I wanted other people’s opinions.   So for financial reasons I live with my mom. She told me that my sister and her husband were bring over their autistic child so everybody could hang out for a while. I immediately told my mom that I didn’t want him [AC] in my room. I own some valuable stuff [PlayStation 4 for example] so I didn’t want anything to break or for a mess to be made because I would have had to clean up. My mom starts in on me telling me that I am selfish and generally b*tching at me. I just walked away so no flames would be added to the fire. So AITA for not wanting AC in my room?\n",
      "Hi!I just need an opinion because I feel really weird.  I had to go to the supermarket and when I was parking my bike, I heard this man who kind of looked like he hadn't showered lately talking very loudly and animatedly. There was another guy there who stood behind me, having a smoke, and I looked at the talking guy to see if he was talking to me. He wasn't looking at me. He talked very loudly and animatedly so I figured 'Ah, he must be talking to the guy behind me and it seems he's in the middle of making a point. Let's go inside the store and not take out my earbuds because I don't want to seem inquisitive and since he's not talking to me, let's just keep em in and enjoy some more of my music.'  The guy follows me inside, and I faintly hear him saying through my earbuds 'Yeah pretend as if you don't hear me. Everyone does that nowadays. Snarl snarl.'  I take out one earbud immediately and apologize, telling him I had my music in.  'Yeah, sure, act like that.'  'I didn't realize you were talking to me, I thought you were talking to the guy behind me.'  'Oh.'  He tells me to not do that again, especially not with older people because it might turn into a misunderstanding (as if this wasn't a misunderstanding), I apologize again, he tells me it's okay and to have a good day, and then he stalks off, not towards the entrance of the store (as in the little flip thingies you have to go through to get to the actual groceries), but towards the cash register (nothing happens there, no worries, it just makes it seem as if he especially followed me inside just for that).  Then when I am looking for something a few isles later, I hear him talking to someone very loudly. Didn't hear what he was saying even when I took my earbuds out. But I feel like he wasn't right in the head. And now I feel weird.  From one side, I shouldn't have to take out my earbuds because I can listen to music if I want and if I realize people are talking to me, I'll just take them out, so it isn't as if I blatantly ignore them. And why shouldn't I get to walk around with my earbuds in? I like music, it's not illegal.  But from the other side I might have been wrong because it looked like I was ignoring him. And I never want to be asocial.  But from the other other side, maybe I shouldn't care about his opinion because he didn't really seem okay mentally. Not because of what he said to me because that was kind of true, but even just the way he talked to everyone, super loudly, as if he was a protestor yelling a speech in the middle of the street.  And now I kind of a curious if someone has an opinion on this.\n",
      "So throwaway account, and english is not my first language, so sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors. Here goes;   Four years ago I (25 f) decided to get a tattoo covering most part of my left forearm. The reasons for why I got this tattoo were several, for starters I've always wanted a tattoo and like the way they look. And secondly I wanted to cover up some scars that I felt selfconscious about, like selfconscious enough to always wear long sleeves. So after having thought for more than a year about which design I wanted and searching for a tattoo artist whom could do that on my arm I finally found one and had a half sleeve done.   Well turns out since I had the tattoo done every older person (like over 50 or so) feels the need to question this choice. From every older relative I've met since (no one else in my family have tattoos) I've gotten comments like \"oh dear what have you done to your arm?!\", \"Do you realise you will have to live with that horrible thing on you for the rest of your life, \"What does your boss think about that, is he really okay with you looking like that?\", or my favourite \"You will have a hard time finding a boyfriend with an arm like that\" (I found one for the record, he has no issues with my tattoo). And I get similar comments from older people whom I've just met, like colleagues or neighbors. I hoped it would stop once people had seen it and gotten used to it, but no, four years later and I still get the same comments from the same people.   Now I love my tattoo, I think it looks nice and it has really helped me with being more comfortable with my body, and it's not an offensive tattoo (it's a design with flowers, leaves and butterflies). However I think it's extremely rude and unnecessary to comment on someone elses body like this. Because after all a tattoo is permanent and what good will it then do to say things like \"oh my what have you done?!\" Of course no one knows that the tattoo covers up my scars, but that shouldn't make any difference. I feel kind of personally attacked whenever someone says something like that, sometimes even a little bit sad by it, but I usually handle it by telling them that I like it and that's what matters to me, and then move on to another subject. Family dinners are turning into events that I no longer want to attend because of having to listen to 5-10 comments like this every time.   Now WIBTA if I told my older relatives that it's extremely rude to comment on a persons body like this especially on something which I can't remove, and neither do I want to. Or should I let it be and accept that I voluntarily inked my body which by most older people in my country is considered taboo and something that is usually done by criminals, etc.   TL;DR I got a tatto, older people feel the need to insult this by rude comments. WIBTA if I told them to stop their rude commenting since it's my body.\n",
      "Throwaway account. Will try to keep it short, but feel free to ask anything. First time posting on Reddit.  TL;DR at the end .  &#x200B;  I'm a woman in my mid-twenties, and so are most of my friends. I've always been pretty thin, skinny even, but most of my friends are now either a bit chubby or simply fat, and most of them have been putting weight on consistently for the past few years. Mid-twenties, as I said. As a result, most of them are now always trying to watch what they eat, trying new diets (and failing), complaining about how hard it is to lose weight. Typical stuff.  &#x200B;  Anyway, when we meet up, we usually go out to eat. And even though I'm skinny myself, by no means I have a healthy, balanced diet. I always have high-calorie, nutrient-poor food (far from ideal, I know). I just happen to have very little appetite, so I get full easily and thus end up eating calories in moderation and remain \"naturally\" thin. So my friends and I will be at the table, they will be having salads, water, bland-tasting low-calorie stuff, while I will be having junk food, sweets, sugary drinks, and the such. And because of this, they have been complaining more and more each time about how I'm \"sabotaging\" their diets, because it's really hard for them to eat \"green\" and healthily while they watch me having all the food they're craving so badly (even if I'm not having too much of it). They say they're more likely to give in to temptation or to binge-eat during or after watching me eat. They say I'm \"inconsiderate\" for not changing my diet \"only\" when around them, to match theirs. It's unfortunately starting to affect my relationship with some of them.  &#x200B;  To make it clear,  as far as I know , none of them currently have or have had in the past any eating disorders. None of them use food as a coping mechanism for emotional distress. None of them are morbidly obese and/or in desperate need to lose weight. They are just your regular chubby folk who like chili fries a bit too much, but would also like to lose a few pounds. They are also adults. And  as I see it , as adults, they alone are responsible for sticking to their diets, however much discipline that requires, and I shouldn't have to stop eating what I enjoy just for them. For me and my own health? Yeah, probably. But not for anyone else.  &#x200B;  But I've been told so many times that I'm \"unsupportive\" and that I \"don't understand the struggle of weight loss\" that I'm left wondering. Am I the asshole here?  &#x200B;  TL;DR: friends trying to lose weight say I make it harder by refusing to stop eating junk food when around them and call me \"inconsiderate\" and \"unsupportive\".  &#x200B;  Edited for typos.  ETA: As I understand it, this post is about to be closed for comments soon. Thanks to all who have commented. Have a nice day.\n",
      "My uncle and I have had a very rocky relationship. TL;DR he moved to Dubai to be with his girlfriend who moved out there. They got married and me and my wife and (at the time very) young child didn't go because:    It was too expensive for us at the time.    We didn't want to travel half way around the world with a newborn baby.    We told everyone we had no intentions of going. Everyone knew. He bought us plane tickets. We said that was stupid as we're not going, and he's never spoken to us since unless we pay him back for the tickets.  BACK TO NOW.  He's become extremely ill in Dubai and has racked up some significant medical bills. His wife has sent us a message with his JustGiving page on it... That's it. No \"hi\", \"how are you?\", \"I know we haven't spoken in 10 years, but...\", etc.  I don't want to give a penny. I don't see why I should.  People think I should give generously because we are quite well off now compared to other members of the family, but I don't think that's fair to assume that.  Of course, everyone thinks I'm the villain for not donating. But this guy is a stranger to me. We didn't have the best relationship to begin with...  Am I the asshole?\n",
      "Throwaway. I (25M) had a colleague (20F) who I will call Tara. Tara and I got on very well while on shift together and enjoyed working together. However, certain things she did bugged me. One was that she always made physical contact with me. She kept touching my had with hers, and would randomly hug me. This wasnt a big issue, but to no real avail I asked her to stop.  The real issue though was when she randomly became comfortable enough to talk to me about sex. This was a no no to me for a number of reasons, one being that with myself being a 25 year old male, I frankly didn't want to talk about sex with my 20 yo female colleague in case people thought I was trying to sleep with her. She started telling me random things, such as what positions she liked etc, and I told her I didn't want to talk about things like that.  Eventually, a colleague of mine thought we were either dating or sleeping together. When she didn't stop talking to me about sex, i reported her to management. She got a warning about it and has been very upset since. AITA??\n",
      "sorry for the grammar ahead of time. I'm not really sure how this works, is my first time posting.  I'm a full time college student and I work full time. The morning I woke her up I had to work late 6 am to 7pm, normal time for me is 6am to 2pm. I woke up at 2:30 am being hungry and decided to make time for studying, I didn't really mean to wake up early but shit happens and I had to make the best of it. I usually never use the kitchen in the morning. I just put on my clothes and go straight out the door, cause I don't want to wake her. So I went to the kitchen to make coffee and oatmeal. I tried to be quiet but from what she told me the light from the kitchen was going into her room under the door. At one point while I was in the kitchen she banged on her door, so I tried to hurry and be more quiet. At one point she uses the bathroom and come out and tells me along the lines of \"hurry up or move out\". As she said this I did apologize, then she slammed her door.......we have neighbors. I do feel bad for waking her and possibly the down stairs neighbors, but I was really hungry and needed coffee to get anything done. she works from home so she usually doesn't start work till 6am or 7am.  Sorry for the rambling and bouncing around in the story.\n",
      "So a little backstory here, I’ve been friends with this person for almost ten years now. She has been a good friend to me, however I just do not agree with her morals.   She has ADHD and claims it’s makes her very impulsive and do things that she knows is wrong. For example: she cheated on her ex boyfriend of a year on two different occasions. She steals clothing, money and really any item you can think of from people and stores. She is probably over a total of 10,000 dollars in debt from borrowing money from others and not paying them back.  I hate this about her and always try to right her wrongs. Recently she stole a 100 dollars and someone’s visa from a party and hid it in a bush to get it another day. Knowing this I went back the next day and returned the money and visa to its owner. If she steals someone’s clothing I go into her room and return it.  Because I am attempting to fix what she does wrong I feel less guilt towards the situation.   I do however adore her friendship. She is one of the most fun, funny people I know and has been a loyal friend to me. I’m so torn as I love her and I don’t understand what it’s like to have ADHD, but I feel it doesn’t give you the right to be a shitty person.   AITA to continue being friends with her, even if I attempt to help her stop and fix what she does wrong?\n",
      "To start things off me, theres me L(14) and my cousin C(14). C has always been quite comfortable with oversharing online for as long as he’s had access to the internet. He’s posted some questionable things in the past but never anything genuinely concerning or upsetting, usually oversharing about personal/family issues. Well as of recently C posted this tiktok story on friends only saying all these horrific things about his dad, talking about how he’s ratchet and his house is ratchet and all of those hurtful things about his father that I know are not true. When I saw it I was honestly hurt that someone would say that about my uncle because he is such a kind understanding man. As people on the internet do, the comments started with the “are you ok?” “Are you safe?”.  Let me add in he was whispering in the video which could very easily lead to conclusions of him trying to get help without people in his house knowing. After I saw this I told my mom because I thought it was extremely out of line for C to post things like this. My mother agreed as did the rest of my family and my mom told C’s dad about it. As I heard C tried to cover it up and lie about it and then blocked me on all social media platforms? Someone tell me AITA for snitching on my cousin?\n",
      "I know it sounds pretty bad but before you judge me, please read this until the end!  It was pretty late in the evening when I (f, 19) went on the bus to get back home. The bus was pretty empty, and almost all of  the seats were free, meaning you hadn’t have to sit next to someone if you wanted to sit down. I sat down on a normal passenger seat.  At a bus stop, a sloppy looking man (I would guess his age was about 35-40) got into the bus and looked a bit around. He saw me and walked towards my seat. He tipped on my shoulder and asked me „Is this seat free?“. I was a little perplexed and answered „It is, but cant you sit somewhere else?“ (Little sidenote: I was pretty scared of him touching me or doing something in this direction when he would‘ve  sat next to me because a lot of my skin was exposed) I tried saying it in a polite tone, but he got pretty angry and saying things like  „Nobody is occupying this seat, I can sit wherever I want, its not your choice where I sit.“ I was afraid of him becoming aggressive so I let him have the seat but stood up and walked to another one.   He didnt say anything more and just left when the bus stopped at the next station.  I‘m sorry for any grammatical mistakes, my native language isnt English!  EDIT: I‘m so thankful for every single one of your responses! Thanks for all the tips and advice, I will certainly take it to my heart!\n",
      "So I was chatting with a guy on a gay dating site. I am not out of the closet in any way and would prefer to keep it that way until I figure everything out, but that's another story, but that information may be important.   Anyway, I revealed some very intimate details of what I am into to him, things that are extremely embarrassing that I would never want a friend to find out. I also shared nude pics with him revealing my whole body including my lack of endowment. I know I shouldn't get hung up on something like my size, but it was yet another factor in my final decision.  He wanted to trade face pics before we met and I agreed and he sent me his pic and my heart dropped because I recognized him! He is a friend of a friend who I don't see often (probably been over a year) but I knew him and he would know me. I freaked out a bit but was honest with him and told him I recognized him and that I couldn't reveal who I was because of what he knew about me. He said it was fucked up and called me an asshole (or the equivalent). He said it wasn't fair, etc.  So, AITA? Should I have sent him my face pic?\n",
      "Since Covid happened the only hours i have been able to get is from full timers who are willing to give me shifts.  I asked boss if he would be reference since he wasn't giving us any hours.  He said why are you quitting,  I said no, but you refuse to give us hours so i need income, ive been without job for almost 6 months.  Boss said, dude times are tough, dont quit on us now, we need you.  I told him sorry, give me hours, he than said you may not use me as reference.  I was really mad but didn't say anything.  AITA?\n",
      "I need a proper perspective on this situation that is why I am here. Throwaway account obviously. My mother(44F) and I (20F) are really close, like I share everything with her and she is very honest no sugarcoating stuff. If I am wrong she points it out and I try to correct myself. I am quite short tempered and I get annoyed easily. I am trying to work on it but its not very easy to change yourself overnight.   A bit of background before I talk about the actual situation: this past month, since we are in quarantine I can't go for my monthly wax so I basically have hair all over and I don't want to shave cause my skin becomes really rough and itchy. my mom took it upon herself to talk about my moustache every other day and how I should wax it off but at this point I  just don't feel the need to cause I am not going out anytime soon and I am fine with it. one day, after I woke up she starts making fun of my moustache and I am just not a morning person (she knows this really well) so I snapped and told her \"stop talking about it continuously cause its not like I don't know, I look at my face everyday\". She felt bad and we didn't talk for a whole day. In the end, I apologised cause it was not right to yell at her.   So the next day when we were back to normal, I told her that my friend called me up to tell that she got an internship, I thought wasn't happening cause of COVID. my friend told me that our classmate told her and few other classmates of mine about this and not me. I was upset cause I always had this hunch that this girl who informed her about this doesn't like me. I told my mom about this and she started questioning me as to why she didn't tell me about it and I told her I don't know cause I had no argument with her or any other classmate for them to act this way. so then my mom told me that she doesn't know anymore how I act with others cause sometimes she can't stand talking to me and that I am repulsive to her. she has said to me before that I am rude when I am angry but never that. thats has been replaying in my head ever since and whenever I think about it, I can't stop myself from crying . My mom knows I have major self esteem and anxiety issues so hearing this from her who I consider the closest to me just hurt me really bad and I am not communicating with her like I normally would. so reddit, am I the asshole here cause I was rude to her and deserved to hear that?  TL;DR was a bit rude to my mom but after apologising to her, she tells me that she can't stand talking to me and that she finds me repulsive, which I have not been able to get over and makes me want to stop talking to her.\n",
      "Here is the background:  &nbsp;  My sister and I have not spoken in the last 32 months since my son was born.  She saw my son while I was off on leave.  I took 3 weeks paternity leave, I had to go back to work with a huge backlog of work. The first 4 weeks back were nuts!  Around that time, when my some was about 3 months old.....my sister sends me a Facebook message telling me I was a jerk for not calling her recently and keeping her nefew from her.   &nbsp;  She blocked me on Facebook and blocked my texts and calls. I was preoccupied and to boot, she never tried to call me once during that time either. Needless to say I was blindsided.  &nbsp;  Fast forward 9 months. She wins 500,000.00(USD) in the state lottery.  &nbsp;  She BLOWS through the money. She purchased a $50,000 Jeep, a Classic Car, a house, she remolded the house. She had plastic surgery done. She has a small amount left over after paying taxes. But decides to quit her job of 15 years as a Factory Supervisor to \"take it easy\" since she didnt have any bills, and she went to work part-time at a retail store.  &nbsp;  So, after that, she got back togrther with an ex, she put the house in both their names, a later took a mortgage out on her house. and now needs $8,000 to bring it out of default before the bank kicks her out.  &nbsp;  To add on to this, she had the same problem 20 years ago. She had a house (not free an clear at the time), but lost it to forclosure because she didn't want to go back to work after having her first kid with the same ex, who was her husband at the time. Basically, they both didnt want to work.  &nbsp;  (Because of,my mother telling her so.) My sister knows I have 12 month's reserve for our house payment. Utilities. Groceries. Insurance saved. Shs also knows I have an emergency fund for any other incidental emergency, and money saved that I continue to save toward for a down payment and closing cost for a new home.  &nbsp;  I have a stable job, been there 14 years, and have saved and worked 2 jobs, off and on, to get where I am...  &nbsp;  Before My sister won the lottery, for years, she leached off my mom. She probably owed my mom $15,000.00 that was not paid back.  &nbsp;  So after my sister, blindsided me, by cutting all contacts, and only resurfaced when she needs money. After not repaying my mother, and irresponsibility quitting her job, and mismanaging her money....she wanted $8,000(USD) to save her home....... I refused to do so, even though, financially I can.....  &nbsp;  AM I The Asshole?\n",
      "This happened a while back but recently its gotten thrown back into my life so I wanted your opinions.   Im gonna keep this short. I was out drinking with a friend and i bought a bottle of vodka. Together we finished it in its entirety and had a great time. In the morning I told him to give me half the price of the bottle back and didn’t think there would be a problem. My friend thinks he shouldn’t pay because, he asked me if its cool that he drinks from the vodka before he would and I told him yeah of course and from that he didn’t think he had to pay. I disagreed since i payed money for it and I thought it was just common sense. Either way, AITAH?  Also this is my first post on Reddit so if i did something wrong, let me know!\n",
      "Ontario Canada...  Today when I woke up in my apartment my bedroom was nice and warm but when I went to the living room is was freezing cold. I tried resetting the fuses and cranked the thermostat but the base heaters wouldn't come on. I called my superintendent and (for once) he came quickly and found that the fuses were ok, so the issue was elsewhere. We both knew an electrical technician would be needed to fix the issue so I thanked him for his quick response and told him I'd email the landlord, which I did. The AITA question here is in the email I sent.  I've had multiple issues with the landlord over the past year due to flooding. Some tiles in my floor have needed to be replaced for months and they've shown signs of mold. I've told them this and they've done nothing. When the heating issue came up I was pi$$ed, and sent the following email to the landlord:  \"This morning I found that the base heaters in my living room/dining room aren't working.  I messaged **** (superintendent) and he came down very quickly to check (he was very helpful).  The fuses are fine so the problem is elsewhere.    The temperature in my apartment is currently well below the legally required minimum of 21 degrees.    If you are unable to repair this issue immediately then you are legally required to provide me with portable heating units, free of charge, until the repair has been completed.    Please respond to this email before 5PM on Monday, October 7th.\"  I'm pretty sure I did the right thing but the Canadian in me worries that I went too far.  I welcome your feedback.  EDIT: Special thanks for the quick response.  I'm not a very confrontational person.  Additionally I'm a recovering alcoholic.  It tends to bring out unwarranted aggression.  I wanted to know that I wasn't blowing things out of proportion.  Thank you all :)\n",
      "I (33F) am concerned about my sister's (23F) health regarding a weird mole on her arm. She told me it's been there for a while. It's raised and looks like a large pimple. I  concerned and suggested she see a dermatologist in a text but she never responded.  Would I be the asshole if I talked to our mom (59F) about my concern too? My sister lives with our mom and they do not have a good relationship at all, my mom can be emotionally and verbally abusive.   My parents have been known to ignore health concerns until it becomes very obvious or someone else points it out. They especially think I'm crazy for my health concerns. They are also anti-vaccine and believe other weird medical conspiracies.   I really just want my sister to see a dermatologist. Am I being paranoid?   WIBTA?\n",
      "This title makes my Brother seem like the Asshole in the situation, but here me out.  I don’t have a good history with Clothes, especially pants. I just don’t like them honestly. My mom recently bought me a Pair of Pants that are Part Sweatpants, part Black Pair of Pants. On Thanksgiving, my brother cut the Cuffs off of them for being too tight.  Honestly, I like them better with them cut off for the same reason my brother liked them better cut off. The one thing I didn’t like about the Pants were the cuffs.  My Mom didn’t Like them cut off by my brother though. Apparently her reasoning is because since she bought the pants, they weren’t supposed to be cut off unless it was from her. I ACTUALLY TRIED (the reason I capitalized this is because I need to change the title now, but don’t know how to on mobile.) to intervene when she was chewing my brother out, But she didn’t want me in the conversation. Plus, I decided to not talk after that as it would probably get both me and my brother in trouble.  Admittedly, the cutoff between the Cuffs and the Pants did look like a dog bit it off.  So reddit, who’s the Asshole in this case? Me or My Mom?  Also, this didn’t cause any problems between the family, that would be just bonkers. We all did make up for it though.  Edit: I’m twins with my Brother, age 15. No, he didn’t ask to cut them off. I also didn’t care when He told me about it.  Edit 2: I tried to stand up for him, but my mom shut me down. I capitalized this because idk how to change the title on Mobile.\n",
      "My boyfriend (30m) and I (25f) have been together for 5 years and have lived together for most of it. Recently he told me that he can no longer afford to live where we live and wants to move back in with his dad for at least a year to pay off debt. He made it clear that this is the only option he wants to pursue and does not want to move to a cheaper place.  I recently got a big pay raise and am finally in a good position financially so do not want to move. His dad's place is a 1200 square foot condo that we would share with him and our 3 cats. We would have our own bedroom and bathroom and I would get a section for an office as I work from home some days. Since it is only a room we get in the condo we would likely have to put most of our furniture and stuff in storage or sell it.  The issue is this living situation makes me very uncomfortable. Not only do I not know his dad, besides maybe 1 or 2 meetings but I would have no privacy and no personal space to myself since I would share a small room with my bf. I would not feel at home working out or in my pajamas if his dad, who is a complete stranger, is always around. Side note: his dad also works from home some days. My bf works shift work so our schedules don't match up a lot and he has problems sleeping with me in the bed (light sleeper and needs it ice cold) so usually when our schedules sync up I sleep on the couch which of course could no longer happen if we only have one room to share.   On top of this his dad's place is in another city. Right now I can walk to work or a grocery store in 10 minutes but his dad's place is about 1.5 hours a bus and 2 trains from my job and not close to any stores for groceries or pet supplies. If I want to see my friends/family or go to the city for any reason I would either have to take transit for 1.5 hours each way or spend $50 on ubers each way. Groceries and any errands would also require ubers or multiple busses because the condo is in a very residential area.  Am I wrong to want to stay in the city and possibly downsize and have him move out? I could afford the rent myself but can't afford to cover all of his other expenses for him to stay here.\n",
      "Okay, so I work night desk at a hotel.  There is a brown purse that has been sitting in the lost and found since mid October. I know it has been there that long because I am the one who put it there after finding it left in our restaurant/bar area.  Following the normal procedure I put it in lost and found without looking inside. Three days later there had been no attempt to claim it.  A week ago, my boss decided lost and found is getting too full and asked me to check through what is in there. She told me to make a legitimate effort to contact the owner if one can be found, and everything else will be donated to Salvation Army or Goodwill or something.  When doing this, I opened the purse to look for an ID. I found one with a name and address several states away.  I also found a good-sized chunk of cash. I didn't count it, but it was a stack of 20's, I'd estimate a couple hundred bucks probably.   Anyway, I looked up the name in the past reservations portion of our computer and called the number she had on file. I got no answers, after trying three times during different times of day.   She had some pretty important stuff in there, like credit cards and insurance cards, and obviously her cash, so I went the extra mile and looked her up on Facebook. I shot her a message telling her I work at the hotel she stayed at in October and we had a purse that seems to belong to her, and I asked her to contact the hotel if she wants it back.  It has been a week and Ive gotten no answer.  If this purse gets dontated I'm not really sure what happens to the cash, but I'm pretty sure it just gets claimed by the company that owns the hotel and then, who knows.  I wont pretend I have some super noble purpose for the money, Id probably use it to buy some groceries and maybe a new chair for my place. But I don't think Id do any worse than the company I work for if they claim it.  I would never touch that money if there was any indication the owner was trying to get it back, but I feel like I have taken every reasonable step in trying to contact her and she doesn't seem too frantic to find this purse. Its been two months, so I think its safe to say she isnt too interested in finding her purse.  Would I be an asshole if I took the cash? It would make that post-Christmas rent a whole lot easier on me.\n",
      "So basically, my boyfriend is 20, but he looks younger, you’d think 15-16. I’m 28 and I look guess I look older? I don’t know, I’m kinda big and I have a beard.  Today someone seriously thought he was my son. While he was laughing, I explained to that person that he wasn’t my son. He was still laughing when we got back to the car, he calmed down a bit and I asked him if he was done. He said “sorry dad”. I got kinda upset and drove home without saying anything, I was giving him the cold shoulder and he got mad at me, he said that I’m overreacting and he was just joking. Now we’re both mad at each other.\n",
      "TLDR: My parents managed my savings accounts when I was younger, and now every time I ask for my own money, I get a lecture that I shouldn't need it and that I spent too much money. When transferring money into my account, my dad snooped around and read my credit card statements. I snapped and told them I'm opening a new savings account that they don't have access to.   My parents come from a culture where you try to support your children as long as you can so they are debt free. They started saving for college when I was born, and I graduated without loans. In college, I worked really hard and saved up a decent amount of money. I got into grad school with a full ride, and had a job that covered rent and expenses, so I decided to put my savings into 2-4 year CDs.   Now I want to prefice this by saying I'm obviously really greatful for all the money my parents have invested in my education. I'm very lucky to be 26 and debt free, I acknowledge that.   Unfortunately, when putting my money into CDs, I was stupid and didn't want to deal with the bank. Instead, my dad set up the accounts in my name. However, he has access and renews or moves around whatever was due.  Great. Until I actually needed that money. Once covid hit, I had no income, and I don't have direct access to my savings accounts and had to ask my parents to move money.  That's when the questions started: Do I really NEED this much? Shouldn't I be saving money and not spending anything? How much could I possibly be paying for groceries and utilities? Every time I asked for some of MY money to be moved over, I would get a lecture about how I shouldn't be needing money yet because how could I have spent what was moved last time already?   Tonight, my dad transfered money into my account and decided to log into the account and look at my statement. He promptly started yelling at me because I \"blew through\" the last transfer (I didn't) and I need to be more responsible. I told him to stop snooping around in my bank accounts. Then my mother lectures me that they want me to be responsible and how could I spend that much money, messaging me the exact payments I made to my credit card. I point out that I have not spent \"all that money\" and that putting money into my account does not give them permission to log in and go through my credit card statements.   Every time we have a fight about them being nosy and me having to justify my spending, it gets thrown in my face that they are so generous and how other people aren't as lucky as I am. I finally snapped and told them I'm going to open a new savings account that they do not have access to, and that I want the information for all my savings accounts.   My mother sent me a private message, stating that I'm overreacting, I should be greatful, and that they are so disappointed because they thought they raised me better, that they thought they raised a daughter who saved for her future and didn't spend her money on stupid things.   AITA?\n",
      "So I live in suburbia and my spouse and I are both working from home for the foreseeable future. Today as I was getting onto a conference call I started hearing drumming from somewhere outside while I was in my house with the windows closed. My spouse heard it too. Once my call was over the drumming was still going on 30 minutes later, so I popped outside to see where it was coming from.   Our neighbors 3 doors down had a drum kit out on their front porch which is where the drumming was coming from. There was an adult on the porch and two children under 10. I was standing on the other side of the street, but this wasn't one of the neighbors that I know. I asked how long the drumming would be going on for, and adult told me they were just wrapping up but he will be coming to give the kids drum lessons every Monday.... I said,  \"thanks for the heads up, just so you know I could hear it in my office\" and went home.  I understand that this family might not want strangers in their house right now because of covid, but I don't think it's fair that they are subjecting the everyone else to a weekly outdoor drum lesson for these kids. Today was apparently the first day of lessons, so I'm not sure if it's bothering any other neighbors yet.  AITA if I say something to these neighbors and tell them that they need to take their drums inside?\n",
      "I (22M) have a friend (21F) Emily. We became friends three years ago. Emily is an extrovert and has a good social circle. But last year, something happened and it completely changed her.   She suddenly became depressed and started talking about how her life has ended and she'd rather die. She'd talk about not being able to do anything. She got a really bad anxiety. It not only affected her social life but also her academic performance. Since I was her close friend, I'd listen to her everyday. I  thought I'd be able to help her.  A while later, it became extremely exhausting. Everyday, she'd talk about same shit. She'd constantly talk about how her life would have been different if she had done certain things differently. I'd constantly counsel her but it felt like talking to a wall cause she'd ignore any sort of advice I'd give her. It seemed like she just needed to talk. I know some times people just need a listening ear and not an advice. But it had been three months of her just constantly crying about same shit. It wasn't normal. She really needed therapy.  However, she refused to go to a therapist. I figured since she isn't in a mental state to help herself, her family might help her. I contacted her mother, and she shrugged it away like it wasn't a big deal.  At one point, Emily started blaming everyone around her. She'd talk about how if people around her had helped her, her depression and anxiety wouldn't have gotten worse. I felt truly hurt because I had already been carrying the guilt of not being able to help her.   It had been almost six months and her condition was just getting worse yet neither her nor her family had done anything to seek professional help. I felt like i'd go crazy at this point if I spent another minute with her. So I started to avoid her. She'd text me every now and then, complaining about how I had changed and was acting like an AH towards her. I told her I need space and she told me that it was just an excuse to get away from her. I told her she can think whatever she wants. I needed space to clear up my mind. Things had been quiet for a while between us. Until one day she showed up at my door in extreme anger.  She called me an insensitive AH and she was crying as she talked about how much I've hurt her with my behaviour and that she didn't deserve to be treated like this and everything she had went through was my fault.I had enough of it so I told her that she needs to stop acting like a victim. I am not responsible for her emotional healing and Im not her personal therapist and that it was shitty of her to constantly blame me. She was shocked for a minute and then she started crying even more and told me that I was indeed a pathetic person and I could have tried to be a little more empathetic towards her.  Now I feel really bad. Should I have not done it? Am I the AH here?\n",
      "For context. I (17F) dated my now ex boyfriend (18M) for about half of high school, from November of freshman year to September of junior year. We fought way too much and ultimately brought out the worst in each other, so we broke up in September 2018 after nearly 2 years together. My mom is the one who helped me the most throughout the breakup, as it was EXTREMELY hard on me and he was my first real love. I’ve had boyfriends since then, and I’m now dating a new guy who both my parents really like. However, in the past few weeks my mom has brought up my ex in conversation all the time. Just saying things like “does he still work at (place)?” Or “how are his college classes going?” (As if I’d know the answer to that). Last night she started talking about him again and ive asked her many times not to talk about him and she continues to do so. I blew up at her and told her to shut the fuck up because we broke up a year and a half ago nearly. She got extremely hurt and said that since she’s the one that helped me the most, she should be able to talk about it. She also thinks that I should be fine talking about it and hearing about him because I’m over him and in a new relationship. I am over him, but that doesn’t mean I want to rehash my past with him for fun. I’m also scared she will start talking about it in front of my new boyfriend. AITA for screaming at her/telling her to stop??  TLDR: my mom won’t stop talking about my ex over a year after we broke up and thinks she has a right to do so.\n",
      "Sorry in advance for any formatting issues, I’m on my mobile. Just for context, I work full time at a bank during the week and Friday and Saturday nights at a local sports bar. I really enjoy my weekends at the bar, I make decent money and work with an AMAZING group of people. Friday’s are usually a bit rough on me, as I work from 7:15am at the bank, then head straight to the bar and work until midnight, sometimes 1am depending on how crazy it is that night. Today I took the day off from the bank so that I could enjoy a four-day weekend, because Monday is a holiday. In the state I live in, alcohol sales are prohibited past 11pm (due to the pandemic), which means that last call is at 10:30 and we try to have our doors closed by 12. We have one regular in particular, “Brody” (who I genuinely believe is a nice guy; he’s stayed to walk us girls to our cars more than once, and will take out the trash if we ask him) who was shooting a game of pool with one of our bartenders and another server who got off early.  After my shift I waited for my GM to finish counting out her drawer. I had had the bright idea for us all to go to Denny’s (US 24 hour breakfast joint) after our shift, since I wasn’t completely exhausted for once.   Well midnight rolls around, and they’re starting another game of pool. Everyone was off the clock, everything was clean, and chairs were up. I waited about fifteen minutes, went to check on my manager, and then gave the guys a warning that we were almost done. One of the guys starts giving me lip about how he still has a full beer (seriously though, how?? Last call was two hours ago!) and I told him he had fifteen minutes to finish his beer as well as his game of pool. I went out to smoke a cigarette, and when I came back not only had he not touched his beer, but they were starting another game of pool.   I, still calm (I’m used to kicking people out, these just happened to be guys who were in every night), told him he had 4 minutes to finish his beer and his game. The guys got fed up with my nagging and decided to call it a night.  Well Brody became angry because I wanted to call it a night. I tried to reason with him, but he kept calling me dramatic and talking over me to the point where I got frustrated and walked out, telling him to “F*** off”. As I stormed away I heard one of the other guys’ comment sarcastically that “Denny’s was going to be SO fun”, which made me even more upset. On the way to Denny’s I made the decision that I didn’t really want to spend more time with those jerks, and called my manager to let her know that they’re welcome to go ahead without me, I just didn’t feel like going. Now the guys are calling me an AH and I’m dreading work tomorrow night...I wasn’t trying to be dramatic or anything, I just wanted to go have fun with some friends on the one night I wasn’t completed exhausted and it was already past closing time! So Reddit, AITA?\n",
      "I (20F) live with my toddler son at my grandma’s place. She divorced my grandpa when my mom was young, and they haven’t spoken since. My grandpa is currently in hospice care, and he’s not expected to make it more than a month or two. My mom and my grandpa are estranged, so he’s leaving his estate mostly to me.   I don’t pay rent to my grandma (but she does benefit, because she gets to spend time with my son) and I’m not working at the moment. Before my son was born, I worked in retail. My grandma wants me to get a job so I can pay rent to her, but I don’t see a reason to work for only a few months until I get the inheritance. The money will be more than $200k, and I won’t need to work for a long time after that. I just want to chill and soak up time with my son before he gets big.   AITA? You should note that my grandma is fairly well off, and I plan to buy her a new car when I get my money.  Edit: in case it wasn’t clear, I don’t just dick around all day. I don’t want to work now because I want to spend as much time as possible with my child. One he starts kindergarten, of course I will work! It’s just that I have the resources not to right now, and I think I will regret it if I don’t soak up my son while he’s little.\n",
      "After my mom gave birth to me and my brother (twins) she started to have a lot of health problems and got a hysterectomy. (This will be important later on.)  So my (14f) mom (46) has recently started talking to from her new job. The guy (J) is 34. They’ve known each other for about a month and a half now, but only started seeing each other about 3 weeks ago.   They were talking to each other and the topic of children came up. My mom has 3 kids while J has none. My mom asked him if he ever wanted kids and he said he didn’t have to have biological children.   My mom keeps saying that she wants to get a surrogate so that she and J can have a baby together. My brother and sister are happy about it, but I’m not. I’m perfectly fine with the two siblings I have and don’t want another. My mom asked me why I don’t want another sibling and I didn’t really say anything back.  Earlier today I was waiting in the car for my mom while she was on the phone and I decided to go in the house to get something to drink. When I walked through the door my mom was crying and she quickly ended the phone call when she saw me. I just looked at her and she said “ I just wanted to tell you that you hurt my feelings about what you said about me having another baby.” I ignored her and went to grab a bottle of water. She asked why I don’t want another sibling again and I said “ because I just don’t.” She asked me how having another sibling would negatively impact my life and I ignored her and just walked out the door.  I told my mom that I don’t want another sibling because I don’t want to babysit, which just some excuse I made up on the spot. She said I won’t have to babysit, which I know is a lie because she makes me babysit my cousins. The real reason I don’t want to have another sibling is because of the way she acts ( she’s homophobic and kinda racist) and how she treats me and my siblings now. She’s not a bad mom, she just treats my brother differently than she treats me and my sister. She always wanted sons because she says they’re easier to raise. She babies my brother and treats me and my sister like maids and if the baby is a girl I don’t want her to grow up and find out that she wasn’t wanted. I also think it’s weird that her and J have only been on 2 dates (they’re not even dating they’re just “friends”) and she already wants to have a baby with him.  I feel kind of bad because my mom has said that if she could have another baby she would, even before she met J. She has also said that she feels bad because she can’t give him a baby due to her hysterectomy.   Her and my sister have been trying to guilt trip me into wanting another sibling but it’s not really working.   So aita for not wanting another sibling?  Edit: I wanted to make it clear that J and my mom aren’t dating. They’re still in the “talking” phase.  Also my mom is openly homophobic and she’s very racist towards Hispanic people. She has told me many times that i’m not allowed to date anyone that’s Hispanic. My mom has said and done many homophobic things and I wouldn’t want my future sibling to get kicked out if they happen to be gay.  Edit 2: My mom and J are 13 years apart. The age-gap is weird to me, but my mom said J doesn’t care about the age difference so she doesn’t either.\n",
      "Recently, due to money constrictions, I've decided to start commuting from school instead of living on campus. I drive to school every Monday morning, and then stay in hotels or local AirBnb's for two nights, and then go home Wednesday night because I have no classes Thursday or Friday. I've told everyone around me that I will be gone for 3 days, and will not return until Wednesday night, including my work. Technically, I am free Tuesday's, but I use Tuesdays to work on schoolwork, involve myself on campus, and just hang out with friends. However, recently, my dad asked me to drive all the way home on Tuesday and sign for a package he ordered. Now, I use roughly a half tank of gas every week driving up, to and from class and my hotel, and then driving back home. The drive home is roughly 45 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Instead of asking my Mother, who works 10 minutes from home, to take two hours from her day to sign for the package, he asks me. I also offered to pay my mom the money she will lose from leaving work, because it was cheaper and less time consuming then me driving all the way home. After refusing to drive all the way home to just sign for a package, my dad then proceeded to blame me for his loss of income, because the package is in relation to his work. He then refused to help me fix my car, and not even allow me to use his garage to fix my car myself. After saying no again, He told me that may be I should just \"stay up there\", in which I took it as him not wanting me to comeback home, ever. AITA for not wasting my time and money when there are simpler and more available people?\n",
      "Me (40F) and husband (45F) both work construction. We have two children 11M and 4M.   Long term AITA lurker here!   As you may know construction hours can be long and all over the place.   I used to pay for before and after school care but as I got older I wanted to be more present for my kids. I am supervisor so I can play with my schedule a bit. I will take my kids to school, work 9-3 with no breaks, no lunch so I can get my work done. Then I pick my children up.  If I ever have early meetings or late meetings I will arrange a babysitter for drop off/pick up.  My husband on the other hand leaves for work and comes back whenever he wants with no regards to my schedule or the children’s schedule.  My only request from him is to inform me when he will be home so I can arrange dinner or extra activities for the children. He is always saying well it’s construction it is unpredictable and I can never know really when I can leave. Also claims too busy working to send a text.   This is something that we fight about a lot. I mean I think I know the answer but please I would like the advise from Reddit.  AITA for wanting to know when my husband comes home from work?\n",
      "My fiancée and I live in my parents house, currently they're gone for work. We've been sleeping in the living room cause the futon in there is bigger/ more comfortable than my bed. My friend comes over one night to visit. My fiancée usually sleep in a very skimpy night gown you can see most of her breasts in. As my fiancée is getting ready for bed I ask her if she wants me to ask my friend to leave so she can get to sleep, or if she wants to sleep in our regular bed, or if she wants to wear my robe since it'smuch less revealing. She says she's okay with sleeping in the living room even though we're still hanging out in there. I say okay, and ask her to wear my robe since he's there. A few minutes later she comes into the living room in just the nightgown, lays on the futon, and her entire boob comes out. Thankfully my friend didn't see (he happened to be looking the other way), but I politely ask him to go outside. We spend the rest of the night outside. The next day when she's on her way to work she sends me a screed saying I try to make her feel bad. Am I the asshole for wanting my fiancée to cover herself around my friend?\n",
      "So me and my mum are surprising my dad for his 50th birthday. Iam 21 and just started working. I paid for the accommodation and flight tickets roughly £1100. Is it wrong of me to expect my mum will cover half the costs. Mainly because its quite a lot of money for me. I will also have to do something big this year for their anniversary which will come out of my pocket. But I don't want to ask her to send money, mainly because I have never asked my parents for money in the last 5years. I also live with my parents and help with groceries every now and then but have no other expenses.\n",
      "Hello Everyone  Me and my two friends are having a \"spirited\" debate regarding my actions last weekend. I am a middle-aged male that is often mistaken for a college kid. Last Saturday Night, me and my two friends went to IHOP at about 11PM to hang out and eat some pancakes. I don't frequent this particular store but from what I understand it is a popular place for college kids after clubbing. Me and my friends were dressed very casually (hoodie and sweatpants) and could have easily been mistaken for college kids despite being three well-earning professionals. When we arrived, there were about 4 other tables and two servers. We ended up with a middle-aged female server. As a former server myself (ironically at IHOP), I am generally sympathetic and polite especially when restaurants are busy. Despite the restaurant not being busy, the service was extremely subpar. The waitress had a passive aggressive attitude and it took 50 minutes for our orders to arrive (all breakfast items which are easy to make). This makes me think she put them in late.  The event in question happened when it came time to pay. I was paying for the meals (no split checks) and had put my credit card into the card holder with the check. At this time there were about 6 tables split between two servers. Instead of taking it, the server told us in a dismissive tone \"You can go wait by the register and I will cash you out in a minute\". Me and my friends gathered our things and I told them to wait outside. After sitting up front for 5 minutes, I tried got the attention of other server who told me \"I can't cash you out and you have to wait for X\". The server walked by the register a few times without cashing me out as she was putting orders in and serving drinks. At the 10 minute mark, my patience had run out and I was pretty tired it was after midnight. The next time she passed, I stopped her and told her \"either you cash me out now or you can explain to your boss why you decided to give us a free meal tonight.\" She was visibly upset but immediately cashed me out. When I told my friends what had happened they told me I could have handled it better. Honestly, as a former server she treated us like we were college kids who wouldn't give her a big tip. Yes she provided service (although shitty) but we clearly weren't a priority. Had the service not been as bad before, I would have been a little more patient.  So AITA?\n",
      "My youngest 2 kids (9 and 10) were playing madden when one of them accused the other of cheating.  (side note:How do you even chew on madden?)  Anyways I walked in when they were yelling at each other and I calmed them down and scolded them for fighting and to prove that neither was cheating I would play a game with them cause they were on the verge of crying cause they were accusing the other.   So we boot up a game and they look directly at my controller for plays and such and I don't want to brag but I schooled them lol.  Like 54-3 was the final.  I told them \"see no one was cheating\" they got confused that their theory that the other one was cheating got debunked.  My wife says I should have went easy on them and either made it closer or let them win.  I kinda agree with what she's saying but I thought that if they see that you can't cheat and I beat them then maybe looking at the other's controller doesn't work.  AITA?\n",
      "I moved in to this apartment about 2 months ago and before I got here, based on the smell (They wouldn't let me tour due to Covid) it had been vacant for a while. There's some neighborhood children which isn't unusual, but there's some that are getting on my nerves for a variety of reasons. The main 3 being;   When they play soccer (my building is at the end of the complex so I have an open lawn next to my apartment) they use the exterior wall as the goal. So they are constantly kicking a soccer ball as hard as they can up against this wall, which has my bedroom and bathroom on the other side. Once they hit the wall so hard it knocked a picture off the wall. It didn't break, but ever since then I get super angry when I hear them slam the ball against the wall.  I'm on the ground floor and for some reason a bunch of kids love to walk their dogs not through the little park they have (my complex is huge) but behind the buildings. Which means I constantly have children walking their dogs through my back yard, and if my blinds are open they peep in my windows. God forbid I want some natural light without being watched.  There are bushes out in front of my front window. Now, my apartment is partially underground because the complex was built on a hill. So while indoors, the window starts at my chest (I'm 5'5\") outside, it starts at your feet. Which means if you are the children in my complex playing hide and seek, when they hide behind these bushes they have a perfect vantage point for peeping in my apartment.    Now, I haven't said anything because I don't have any particular  problem  with them looking in my windows. I don't roam around naked, and I live alone so I don't have to worry about traumatizing them if they decide to look in. And I realize they're children. They're looking in due to curiosity, not malicious intent. But constantly being peeped on makes me uncomfortable.   But I also realize that I'm the one that picked the ground floor apartment, and they've been allowed to play in that yard and around those bushes for longer than I've been here and I don't want to be the grumpy old \"get off my lawn\" geezer, but I'm tired of being peeped on. I bought some window screens that blur the windows so I can get some natural light without feeling too uncomfortable, but they're still constantly walking their dogs through my yard and kicking their ball against the outer wall.  So, Would I be the asshole if I asked those kids not to play near my apartment any more?\n",
      "I have to make a disclaimer that no mater how long this is, i cant completely and accurately portray this situation  My girlfriend and i have been dating for almost four years and this is our first year living together in a student apartment. We argue very often and have a very rough patches, but i do love her and our lives revolve around each other. I try to help her when shes upset but she often pushes me away, not letting me touch her and saying nothing is wrong when something clearly is. When i eventually pry it out of her its often not the whole truth or just \"what i want to hear\". This annoys me to an extent I can't describe  I am stupid and sometimes I i sound meaner than i want to when im trying to find out what's wrong, or just tell her straight up how i feel/what i think needs to be done. Shes lately been saying that it makes her feel like I don't care. Allthough in my mind, me trying to get the bottom of the problem so i can help is showing i care  I can only help her to a certain extent and in my opinion if she doesn't want to help me understand what's wrong then i cant help her properly. For 4 years i have been asking her to see a councilor (for this and other reasons) but she refuses saying it wont help and that it doesn't matter. It does matter to me, i think she needs to let everything out and come to terms with our relationship/her personal problems.  So reddit, am i the asshole for telling her to see one, and Telling her i can only help so much?\n",
      "My mom and her BF live together and retired a few years ago. Before retirement she would talk about traveling, hiking and running more after she retires. A few years ago, he injured his knee and needs to lose 15 lbs before he can get it fixed. He can walk a few hundred yards on paved surfaces, but no stairs, hikes, or traveling. During the family gatherings he will say \"he's trying to lose some weight so he can have the surgery.\" However he has only gained weight since we've known him.  Recently she started to show signs of severe depression. Waking up crying, staying in bed for hours, sometimes not leaving her room until noon. When I heard this I went and stayed with her for a few weeks and tried to help. When I got there, that's what I see. She cried every morning, he leaves her to go make coffee and walk the dog. When he gets back he watches TV. I go in and comfort her. Get her out of bed, walk with her to get coffee, talk about her feelings, goals, and take her to a yoga class. We end up having a great day. When we get back the BF is watching TV, waiting for her to get back so they can eat pizza.  This cycle repeats for several days. I wake up, check on her, she's crying in bed, he's walking the dog. I comfort her and eventually convince her to get out of bed, and walk to get coffee. When I ask her about traveling, 5ks, hiking etc, she says her BF can't do them and she feels weird doing them alone. But after he has the surgery she would love to. When I ask if she thinks he is trying to lose weight she tells me \"he says he is\", but its obvious he's not. From our conversations I realize for the last year or so this has been their routine, eat unhealthy food and watch TV. No hobbies, very little activity, no goals. And because he's \"injured\" she waits around on him.  I decide to have a conversation with the BF. I start with \"what can we do to help my mom get better?\" He gets defensive and says hes tried everything. \"what can YOU do to help your mom get better?\" I tell him getting her up, out of the house to get coffee is better than her laying in bed and crying. I've been doing that.  I bring up her wanting to eat healthier and I support that, but do not get the impression he does. Things get a bit tense and he asks me again \"what are you going to do to help your mom get better? When was your flight home again?\" I fire back with \"when are you going to lose the weight you keep talking about? My mom would like travel, go hiking, explore the world but she's waiting on you to lose the weight. I think eating shitty food, sitting on couch watching TV all day is a major cause of her depression.\" That didn't go over well, and he's convinced her that I humiliated him and now she wants me to apologize because he feels humiliated.  Was I out of line asking him those questions? Do I owe him an apology?  &#x200B;  **Edit** I appreciate all the concern about what my mom should do for her depression. She is on medication, is in therapy and is doing much better now. We also do not think that her BF losing weight will fix her depression.\n",
      "I recently got into a fight with my parents. I'm at an unhealthy weight, but I've tried to cut off fast food. I haven't ordered from a while, but my brother has a few days ago.  My parents assumed it was me that ordered, and brought it up the next day (today). Now, one thing that really annoys me about my parents is that once they come to a conclusion, they run with it, even if corrected.  In this situation, they were acting as if I had ordered fast food. They started talking about it in what seemed like a mocking tone, and I explained to them that I did not order fast food. My mother then began fabricating events about how she saw me eating fast food a few days ago  (I can understand 1 situation in which she thought I did, but I do not recall anything else happening.)  &#x200B;  Eventually, my father got pissed and asked to \"stop treating them as if they were kids\" and then my mother began talking about how she fears that I wouldn't care for her when she grows old.  Now, please assume that I have been as rude as possible in our conversation, as I do tend to get heated when it comes to arguing with my parents.\n",
      "Me, B (F25) and my two friends W (F23) and L (F23) have been having issues with our friend M (F24). These issues have been ongoing and frequent for the last couple years. To put a long story short, she likes to create a lot of unnecessary drama and constantly does things to make us upset. For instance, she continued to talk to W’s abusive ex for about a month after they broke up, and she treats L like she is made of glass and is lesser than because of her disability. As for me, she always brings up and makes fun of personal topics, like sex. We have all been friends since high school and M’s maturity has not changed since then. She’s always apologizing and telling us that she’ll change… and then just doesn’t.  We are in kind of a weird dilemma. L lives about 2,000 miles away and we want to plan a trip to visit her this summer. At the moment, none of us are speaking to M. We had a big blow-up a couple weeks ago and M hasn’t really messaged us or talked to us since. However, we need to plan this trip soon, which means that we need to figure out how many people we’re travelling with.   We don’t really want M to come along, even though we know she would want to. She would bring the whole trip down with her attitude, like she did last time we visited L. We haven’t confronted her about this yet, nor have we told her that we are planing this trip.   Are we TA for not telling her, and planning this trip without her?\n",
      "recently my (19f) boyfriend (21m) of seven months asked me if we wanted to get dinner, but wanted some gas money since he’s been driving back and forth between our houses and work a lot and has been low on money lately after the holidays and due to his narcissist mother who is living off of him (he pays her car insurance, utilities, other bills). We both live at home and make about the same amount and live 15 minutes away from each other and his work is about 25 minutes away. I’m usually happy to split things financially with him because I don’t expect the man to pay for everything and he has extra expenses that I don’t such as a car that takes premium gas and his mother. I agreed in the moment to give him money since I figured he’d want to go out to eat. I then suggested to just make dinner at home since I know he’s worried about money and he agreed. After I made dinner for us and he was leaving he told me he was getting gas on his way home and asked again for the gas money. I felt weird and wrong about it since I just made a very nice night for us and we didn’t go anywhere or spend any money but I still said yes because it was cold and late. I didn’t send him the money and he texted me when he was home saying he didn’t need it anymore and that he’d, “really appreciate it when I ask for something that is kind of important like that that it be done sooner rather than later.” like I said i’m usually happy to give him money but this made me feel really disrespected as I just made a nice night for us and it felt like i was paying to see him. I brought this up over text as well as sent him the money and he sent it back and said he wished i’d brought it up sooner and that unfortunately “things costs money” and i’ll admit I should have brought it up before he left but i didn’t think he would be unable to get gas without my money, which he wasn’t. I’m very generous with him and already pay for a lot of stuff like food when we go out. he just took his mom out to dinner tonight when we were supposed to hang out and I don’t know if i’m crazy for being upset. I love buying him gifts and stuff but i don’t wanna be taken advantage of. I know he feels bad asking for money and i’m happy to oblige but the way he did it this time really upset me.  EDIT: he does all the driving as I do not drive due to car related trauma. and I know he’s not asking for money out of maliciousness he’s doing it out of survival. his mom is really crazy and controlling and his situation leaves him unable to leave her like the rest of his siblings did. so i’m fine with putting up with his mom in this situation because if he left her she’s be homeless and on the outside she’s a very nice woman and she likes me a lot. she’s just draining my bf and it’s starting to affect our relationship. I am not mad at him for asking for money and i never will be, I was upset about his being so adamant about it after I worked hard to make a nice night for us for cheap.\n",
      "I(18 F) and my boyfriend(18 M) just had an argument, we were hanging out with a group of school friends and we were playing a card game, my boyfriend was sitting with another friend a little far away. He was putting his head on the door acting “emo” and another classmate started recording him using a tik tok audio about something stupid regarding emo people. I laughed and said “okay stop that’s mean”, I guess they recorded him again using the same audio and he got upset and left for the bathroom.  I thought it was weird since he usually doesn’t get this upset at these types of jokes. When he gets back I ask him if he’s okay and he said yes. At the end of our game he started leaving and when I followed after him and asked if he was okay he got mad at me and started yelling at me saying he doesn’t want to talk to me and how I should have defended him and told them to stop. I said I can’t control other peoples actions and I did say to stop.  He got even more mad at me bringing up how I thought he was ugly. I’m still shocked and upset about it because the only time I’ve ever really even called him ugly was in the cute and playful way that I joke around with him (he does the same to me). So, am I the asshole?\n",
      "We’ve been together for about 10 months now and things started going downhill at about 6. I’m still pretty young (high school) and I don’t believe there are “serious relationships” at my age  So a quick backstory. The night before of this I was going through a really bad breakdown so I decided to text him. He skipped over my texts and said he really tired and wanted to sleep. I felt a little bit hurt that he didn’t seem to care so I talked to my friend who I call my brother ( this is important later). He made me feel better enough to get it together and calm down.   Anyway the next day my bf apologizes for falling asleep. I was still a bit mad at him so I brushed him off for a while but finally caved in and talked to him. He asked me if I was ok and I told him I was fine and that I talked it out with my brother. He got really mad at me for calling my friend that. He said something about my friend that was just messed up so I snapped. I broke up with him on the spot and left to go home. He later texted me apologizing and sending me pity texts so I just ignored him.  Now he’s just threatening both of us and accusing me of cheating (which I didn’t do). Am I the asshole for dumping him?\n",
      "This is more of my husband’s (43M) dilemma but we are in this together so sharing it here. My husband Chris is in car club and owns a daily drive car and a show car. This post is about his show car.  Early 2020, Chris’s car got a flat tire while driving and it broke the bottom carbon fiber (sorry, car people, i don’t know the name of the parts). It was custom made, so needed someone who can make the same front carbon fiber pieces. He dropped it off at this guy’s shop (Raul). Chris knew Raul from word of mouth from the car club, so he did get a good price. Chris paid a deposit of $1k at drop off, then a month later paid an extra $3k when Raul had to outsource something and was really going to work on the pieces.   Then Covid hits, no one was working, no outsourcing available. Since it’s a show car and there was no car shows happening, and we all simply have more important things to be worried about than fixing a car, Chris and Raul agreed to put the project to the side for a bit.   Sadly, Raul got covid and passed away December 2020. Chris found out about it when he called the shop in early 2021 asking if we can jumpstart the project again, and it was his wife who answered and told us the bad news. Obviously a sad situation, Chris said his condolences and hung up. Called again a week later to schedule a time to tow our car to our place. We have since fixed the car from someone else, it was more expensive and took a few months but at least it’s done now.  We decided to reach out to the wife last week with our receipts and paperwork for the $4000 we paid for. We were going to let go the $1k deposit, but the $3k work was untouched, no outsourcing labor or material was ordered yet. She was VERY upset that we had asked for our money back. Not so much of business talk, but more about “can’t believe my husband is gone and I have to deal with all this money he owes people”.  We both feel really really really bad, trust me. It’s just that, we had to pay the towing out of the shop, also paid to get it fixed at a different shop. $3k is not little for us, though we are probably in a better financial situation than her atm. We did want to give her time to figure things out, which is why we didn’t reach out till now. So WIBTA if I keep pursuing this money?   Side note: Raul was the guy who does the work, but his wife works the backend stuff. So it is their shop, and the shop is still around. As far as I know, they still have staff there.\n",
      "Some background: my (f24) friend (f23) is now 4 months pregnant with her first child. She lives with her boyfriend (m26) at his parents house and they have 2 indoor cats and also take care of some neighborhood cats. One of the indoor cats got out and came back pregnant and my friend and her boyfriend decided to keep one of the kittens as their own (this was pre-pregnancy). This cat (f) is now about a year old now.   This is where I might be TA: one of my friends pregnancy symptoms is intense jealousy and because of this she has come to HATE the cat. She called me crying one day because she said she couldn’t stand the way the cat was looking at her bf and that she’s been getting bad vibes from the cat. She said she’s been resisting the urge to go dump the cat somewhere bc she understands that it’s the pregnancy hormones that are making her feel like that, but she can’t stand being in the same room with it anymore. She’s even banned her bf from playing with the cat in her presence. She told me she wanted me to come take the cat behind her bf’s back bc she knows how attached he is to the cat. I myself have 2 cats and absolutely love them and would hate if I had them taken away, but I also don’t want her to end up dumping the cat somewhere either. Because of this, I told her I would take the cat, but now I’m regretting it because I know how gut wrenching it is to lose a pet and I don’t want her bf to feel that way.   If my friends symptoms go away I am more than willing to take the cat back. Also, she doesn’t want her bf to know that I’m taking it because she knows he wouldn’t accept that so she wants to make it look like the cat ran away. So AITA for taking the cat behind her boyfriend’s back?\n",
      "This is literally so stupid but alas here we are. So I (13f) love reading and by doing that I have quite an extensive vocabulary. (If it matters I am autistic.) I love using the complex words for just about any reason cause I love how they sound. For example blasphemy, and futile are my favorite words. I love hearing them and writing them because it makes everything look fancy.  Well today in class one of my bullies (John if you have read my previous post) tried talking to me. I was appalled and shot him down immediately. He tried several more times throughout class and I was sick of it. So I told him, “If I wanted to natter (means talk to someone casually) off to someone it wouldn’t be you.” He looked at me with the weirdest look and said, “Shut up you retard! No one wants to fear you fancy talk!” (For people who didn’t see my last post this is not the first time he has called me a retard)   After class people gave me the weirdest looks and started mocking me.   So Reddit am I the asshole?\n",
      "I (24F) met this guy (44M) on a dating app about a month ago. He lives in a different state.  He’s come to visit me and this past week I went to see him.  We’ve had a few issues. My main issues are the fact that I have pretty bad anxiety and I tend to “run away” at conflict. I was in a emotional abusive relationship a few years ago and if I see certain behaviors l usually just dip.   Every time I tell him how I feel, he gets really defensive and dismissive. I tend to disengage after.  He usually makes me breakfast and I try to wait for him to eat, he hates that. This time I ask him why he doesn’t like eating with me. I figured cold eggs isn’t the only reason. He says that’s ungrateful. I tell him I don’t mean to be ungrateful. He goes on about that’s how he was raised and when he visits his mother or grandmother that’s how they treat him (Italian). They cook things for him and he eats as they cook. I tell him that in my home we don’t do that (African). Regardless of if it’s a big meal, we wait for whoever finished cooking to start eating. I try to explain again where I’m coming from, not to convince him that he’s wrong. I say “I just feel like I’m being rude…” and he cuts me off and says “I already told you it was fine” in a really dismissive tone. So I get really quiet and disengage. He tries to ask me a few questions and I answer them but I’m not really there. He asks me what’s wrong, if I want to talk, but at this point I don’t even want to try. I tell him why I’m quiet and he has a negative reaction to that. We had plans & he says why would I take you out and put all this effort into showing you my city if you don’t even care. I tell him that’s not the case. I was really excited to see the area but at the moment my feelings were really hurt. He now decides that he doesn’t want to go on the bike ride and he wants to stay at home and be miserable. He asks me if I want to get an earlier flight.. I’m taking this as a suggestion so I’m like sure and I go and start packing my stuff. He asks me if this is what I really want to do and I say no but I can’t imagine being with someone that makes me feel bad every time I tell them how I feel. He loses it. He says “fuck you ___” multiple times. Goes off about how ungrateful and selfish I am. How he’s done so much for me and treated me so well. How he’s made me feel really good a lot of times. More fuck you’s and at this point I’m trying to get tf out of there.   So I pack all of my stuff, and as I’m walking to the door he starts throwing my anxiety and “self-sabotaging ways” in my face, says some stuff about me being immature and just giving up and I just walk out.   TDLR: He says that I’m wrong for leaving and that I was being irrational by leaving. I would like to know if I am the asshole and if maybe I did overreact to this situation. Maybe it wasn’t that big of a deal.\n",
      "So this is my first post here and I just need an outside opinion to make sure I am doing the right thing or being a dick.  Earlier this year I started a theater class to help me with my overall shyness and public speaking. The course turned out amazing, I love my classmates, we worked on a play for 6 months and later today we are going to premiere it to the public. We are all very excited and planned to go for a few drinks after it.  I, of course, invited my parents and closest family to come and watch it. I wanted to share this big moment with them. But then my mother had other plans.  She decided to have a big family dinner after my play. I told her I already had plans but I would try to make it to both. She took offense to that. “The idea of having a family dinner is to have EVERYONE there”  We had lunch together, I helped with groceries, I helped with cooking, but I never said my plans changed. They are both being very possessive about my schedule and take every opportunity to tell me they expect me to go with them to the dinner. Im seriously considering not showing up to dinner altogether. WIBTA if a just dont show up?\n",
      "So background: My MiL and I have always bad some issues. She's divorced, single, lives alone, and recently moved across the state to be closer to my husband and our 8 month old daughter.   Now onto the story. Yesterday we went out to lunch with my mother in law, my husband, and my daughter. Lunch was fine, food was great, we talked and got along just fine. I even hugged her goodbye (I'm not a touchy person so hugging her is compromising and really affectionate for me) I thought all was well. Then I get home and see she posted on social media a picture of her, my husband, and my daughter, with a message about what a nice lunch she had with just the 2 of them. I went to the bathroom during lunch, where she quickly took the picture of the three of them. (I totally understand wanting some pictures without me and wouldve taken the picture had she asked) I didn't even know about the picture until I saw it on social media. And it honestly kind of upset me that she went out of her way to make it look like I wasn't there. I didnt mind the picture, just the sneakiness of taking it while I was in the bathroom and then not tagging me in the post about lunch like I wasnt there. (Yes I know its dumb that I'm upset about social media. It's just it seemed like our relationship was on the up and the post makes it seem like she still has beef with me)   So when I saw the post I requested to tag myself in her \"check in\" to the restaurant we were at  and commented \"Lunch was great! I'm so glad the 4 of us could get together! :)\" admittedly it was pretty passive aggressively addressing that she intentionally excluded me, but I think to anyone else it just looks like I enjoyed lunch with my family. She got so upset that I \"attacked\" her on social media that she deleted her whole profile.   So Reddit, AITA for commenting on her post?\n",
      "I have a pretty good friend (Adam) who will sometimes talk over me after asking me a question/while I talk or will fully admit they weren't paying attention (something I pointed out to Adam last night and he apologized). Last night we were chilling in a voice chat with another friend (V) and Adam is showing us stuff but is super quiet. Another person joins us (Z) and it's a complete 180 change in tone, enthusiasm and they go from 20% interacting with us to 85% fully engaging new person and taking charge. I ask Adam privately if they were upset because before the new person came in, he was all quiet and it seemed odd.   I have a good relationship with the two other people there - they're both like little brothers to me and I've told them that they are adopted (jokingly/affectionately) in private conversations before. While we talk as a group, I called out how both my adopted ones are here and Adam asks what is he to me a few times. First two times, make a reference to an anime we both love (which is essentially calling him my family).  I stop trying to answer after the third time he asks.   Today he tells me that when I asked why he was so quiet with me and person 1 yesterday, he said that he felt left out when I was talking about the others. I pointed out that I answered him, and he's technically closer and I said it twice. He mentioned he heard what I said but just didn't really pay attention to what I said. I pointed out that this goes back to when he ignores what I say at times and that I already considered him so \"high\" on this \"list\" what else can I say? And on top of that, the answer seemed odd to me because I was asking if he felt bad before that last person (Z) came in to the call, and if this caused his quiet mood originally, how could it have happened if the 4th person(Z) wasn't even in the call yet, so I hadn't said the words that would have made him feel bad???  AITA - he's a good dude, so I'm bummed that I accidentally made him feel bad but I'm also confused because I did include him, he just didn't pay attention to what I said\n",
      "I (24f) have a 6 month old baby with my now ex fiancé (33m). He’s not really in the picture anymore due to him starting to do drugs. He would do them with me and the baby in the apartment so we left about 2 months ago. Since then we’ve been living with my parents. My mil comes over once a week or so to see her grandchild which I am fine with. I’ve always had personal issues with her bc she would criticize me to her son and I feel like she has no boundaries. She came over the other day and told my mom (not me) that she would like to take my baby to her house for a couple of hours to watch without me. I just feel uncomfortable with that. She’s never really been alone with the baby and I see how she is with her other grandchild, she spoils them and talks shit about their mother all the time. I said okay to be nice but then I saw a text she sent to my own mother talking shit about me and blaming me for her sons drug problem. Now I really don’t feel comfortable and want to say no if she asks. Would that make me an ahole?\n",
      "I (18F) am in a long distance relationship with my fiancee (21M) and he is going to come visit for the holidays. We have been planning this trip for months and have not seen each other in half a year. Needless to say we are both extremely excited for this and have had all the details worked out far in advance. Well it turns out my extended family ( whom I am not close to) decided to plan a surprise party for our grandmother on the same day my fiancee is supposed to fly in and I am supposed to pick him. My sister (30F) thought it rude of me to not show up at my grandma's party. She attempted to guilt trip me about his calling me flaky, and saying I was abandoning my family for a boy. She then suggested that I let my fiancee get a rental car and drive himself to our place. For context he has never been here before. I told her no and that I would never do something so rude to someone who is flying form 3000 miles away to see me. My sister still insists I am being a disrespectful and rude to our grandmother. Thoughts?\n",
      "Hi! I wrote this a while ago, but it didn't let me post it. Just keep in mind that I wrote this a couple of months ago, during the major virus outbreak. Also, her attitude has gotten way worse now.  My sister (17 F) and I (19 F) live in Spain. Right now, because of that famous virus, we're in strict quarantine. We can't go out unless it's for grocery shopping. They're giving tickets if you get caught skipping isolation. My mother's coworker has been tested positive for the disease, so everyone at her work is in even more strickt quarantine.  My sister has always been a bit entitled. This last year she's been a total asshole to me. Everytime I make a mistake, there she is, reminding me how useless I am. Body shaming me, food shamimg me. I'm not even that bad, I think, she's thinner than me, more sporty, vegetarian. But I'm not fat, and I eat healthy.  Today, after a long morning of her being a jerk, my mother told us we had to go grocery shopping, and we also had to get food for our grandma. As we were leaving, I noticed she had a book. I thought maybe she was planning on not helping me out with the shopping and just staying in the car, so I asked her what was the book for, and she just said casually: \"oh, yeah, I'm gonna ask you a favour\". I saw it coming, and I said no. She started complaining. \"But listen!\"  I did. She proceeded to explain exactly what I thought: she wanted me to drive her to her boyfiend's place, leave her there for the afternoon, and then come back to pick her up when I was done with groceries+delivering. Not only she wanted to skip quarantine, but she also wanted me to do the stuff alone. She also asked me to give her some money- she already owes me like 17 €.  If we weren't in quarantine, maybe I'd let her. But our mother is pretty scared with all the virus stuff, and if she found out, she would have freaked out, and would be legitimately angry at us (especially at me). I said that to my sister.  She insisted a lot, telling me that mom wouldn't know, that she was sorry for not helping me with the groceries, but it was going to be okay. I struggle a lot on standing for myself or for stuff that I think is correct, but this time I was firm, and drove to the supermarket, away from her bf's place. She started to cry and scream. I tried to calm her down, apologised, but there's nothing I could do in this situation. She then shouted that she didn't want to listen to my ugly voice, and that I was gonna shut up and drive her to her bf. When I didn't change my mind, she just kept crying and ignoring me. She didn't help at all, she just kept insulting me every chance she had. She made the trip significantly harder than it should've been.  I know quarantine sucks but it has to be done. Also, she knew she didn't have my mother's permission to see her bf. It's not fair for anyone, but seeing her throwing a tantrum all afternoon, and that she's my sister, am I the asshole?\n",
      "Context: This summer my parents have signed me up for an SAT prep class. Its a pretty heavy workload but I'm able to deal with it, and have done so for the past two weeks (roughly five rounds of assignments give or take). My parents recently got a new router after almost a month of internet troubles and now my father is restricting my internet access to end at 11pm (has been threatened for 10, not sure when the exact time is now), as well as the websites I can visit (posting this from an opera vpn). My father is doing this because he is concerned about the amount of time I sleep, me using my laptop in my room, and also because of arguments pertaining as to when and how I do my assignments. My father is of the opinion that you should get everything done first and then do whatever later, but seeing as the assignments for the SAT class take upwards of 4 hours or more, this does not happen for me (I get distracted and bored and go do something else). He is understandably concerned about the completion of assignments and how I do in it, as my parents are the ones paying for the class.  I took my laptop into my room last week at night and made the stupid mistake of allowing him to see that (hence the now 11/10pm internet cutoff). The weekend after I underestimated the amount of time I would take to complete the assignment, and requested for an extension on the amount of internet time I had to be able to go past 11pm. He freaked out a bit after.  This caused a cascade of events, starting with him demanding that I finish the work before 6pm. I did not finish before 6, and I take full responsibility for that. He freaked out some more and this eventually culminated in the threatened 10pm internet cutoff, and blockage of websites after search history checking.  I have successfully completed every assignment that the SAT class has given me, I just do them a bit later than my father would prefer. I have a tendency to procrastinate on work, but I do always get it done and turned in. My father wants my top priority to be the SAT class, and I feel like he is overreacting to the situation.  I will be entering junior year of high school come fall, as well as turning 16 in a couple of months, and I feel that it is an overreach for my father to do such things at a point in time where I should be reasonably expected to know how to take care of my own business. I feel that getting 7-8 hours of sleep is a perfectly reasonable amount of time and I should be able to manage things like my sleep schedule without parental intervention. I want to be able to do things in privacy, on my own time basically. My father feels like I am not responsible enough to manage it all on my own, which has resulted in what the situation is now.  AITA?\n",
      "The camp I’ve attended my whole life is always looking for youth counselors I had some pretty awful ones as a youth and I always said when I was older I’d be one to make sure no one else had the experience me and my friends had with terrible judgmental counselors.

      "Okay so I'm currently 33 weeks pregnant with our 2nd son. Our first is turning 2 this week, and we both work 45 to 50 hours minimum a week right now, so both of us are already a little stressed, just for some background. Last week my husband and I were at his parents house, I got there about 6 and my husband had been there since about 3 (She usually babysits for us while I work during the day) when I got there my MIL brought our son outside to me since I hadn't made it in the house yet. As I'm walking around the yard with him and letting him play for a few minutes I realize hes pooped. No big deal, take him in and go to change him and his butts red, I look into the other room as I'm changing him and ask my husband when he was changed last and if he was red when he was changed (I wasnt super concerned, it wasnt like bad bad, kinda just like a sweat rash, I just wanted to know how long it had been that way) well MIL (who I wasnt even talking to) butted in and said she just gave him a bath and he was fine. I said okay cool, well hes red now so I need some diaper rash cream (I probably did come off as a smart aleck because as I mentioned I'm stressed) she storms into the other room to get it, throws the cream on the bed and stormed out. So whatever shes in a mood, so we left. My husband stayed for a little bit after I left and he said that when I left she was saying she isnt going to babysit anymore (which is fine I can change around my schedule so she doesnt have to) because she says I dont think she changes him like shes supposed to (which 1) I never said and 2) I wasnt even talking to her to begin with) then when my husband went to leave she said \"so I guess she isnt going to apologize\" after she'd spent the rest of the time ignoring him as well. He just said \"I guess not, see you later\" and when he got home he agreed that she was being unreasonable and blew it way out of proportion. My thing is I always ask questions when she keeps him like \"what all has he ate today?\" And \"did he nap and for how long?\" And it's never been an issue before. My husband thinks I should apologize and talk it out with her even though I didnt say anything out of the way because \"you know how she is\" but shes been like this the whole 7 years weve been together and I'm at the point in this pregnancy where I dont care anymore and I'm just tired. And I also dont think it's okay for her to just decide she wants to uproot my sons whole routine because shes mad at me, that's not fair to him. But on the flipside maybe I am wrong because I DO KNOW how she is.  TLDR; made MIL mad by asking when my son was changed last, she took it like I said she wasnt changing him, wants to stop babysitting because shes mad at me, husband thinks I should keep the peace and apologize first.\n",
      "I work at a Cannabis growing facility. A common task we have is defoliating the leaves from the plants before harvest. This is done by plucking the leaves off I individually by hand.   One coworker (we'll call him Sid) blows through tables so fast its ridiculous. He works easily 4 times as fast as I, and most other employees, do. He also creates a huge mess of leaves on the ground and tables as he frantically trips through the plants.   I've always known that he knocks buds of the plants at higher rates than other people. Today I got to see it up close. We were up against a deadline and he finished his table early. I asked him to help me get the last section of my table done. He went through a section that would have taken me 40 minutes to do in 10 to 15 munutes and then left to go clean up his section.  So I took the opportunity to look through his debris field and bucket of waste. Well over a dozen buds. For referendum in the previous hour and a half I had knocked of 4 buds and he knocked off like 15 in 10 minutes. This is about 70ish dollars worth of product retail, about a quarter...every 10 minutes.. we spend 8ish hours every 2 weeks doing this job.   He saved maybe 10 to 15 dollars worth of wages and ruined 70 dollars worth of product just in that one short time span  WIBTA if I brought that up to my boss... Because it pisses me off  Edit:  I did mention to him as I saw of Bud fall to the ground that he needed to be more careful. He packed up and left right after that period I've also mentioned to him that he was being wasteful on a completely different task once before.  Tl;dr comerker works fast but destroys more product than he saves in time and I want to tell my boss\n",
      "We’re coworkers. We don’t see each other often at work (thank god, I’m mortified). She moved to my city like 2 months ago and we started hanging out. We’d basically do stuff my boyfriend didn’t want to do like go to the local theatre, wine and paint, roller skate, etc. She knows I have a boyfriend. She doesn’t know we’re open as I don’t go around advertising that we’re poly. Especially to people I don’t plan on sleeping with.  We’ve been “flirting” but honestly I thought we were gal-pal flirting because she’d never let it get too far (never physical or overly sexual). I didn’t even know she was bi. Like as a bi women, I realize we exist, she’s just never talked about women like that. We’d comment on hot men together but when I brought up attractive women she didn’t say anything.   Last night, I was at her house and she kissed me. I kissed her back. She felt me up. I pulled away and asked “is this okay?” She said yes. We continued. I went home once we were done. She kinda hurried me out the door and I didn’t get a chance to talk.   I texted her first thing this morning explaining my boyfriend and my situation. I added that it’s okay if this is a one off, and that we’re not looking for a “unicorn”.   She went off. She said this is why bi women suck that we use each other. That she wanted me be with her only (I guess leave my boyfriend?). She said she thought we “had something”   I dont know.  Did I lead her on?  AITA?\n",
      "I (30F) teach middle school special ed. A coworker asked me if I would be willing to help out an acquaintance of his with one of his college assignments. The guy asked me for some basic information about a student and asked to do an observation, and I said yes. He then said he needed to come in literally the next day to do it because his professor didn’t give him enough time to complete the assignment since he doesn’t work in a school and most of his classmates do. I was annoyed but made it work for him. I figured that was the end of it, but he emailed me a couple days later saying he needed more information and he needed to record himself teaching a student, again he said his timeline was short. It was a busy day and I missed my prep so I hadn’t responded by the end of the day, turns out he texted my coworker and was freaking out. He needed the info right away and felt like I was ignoring him, even though it had been less than a day since he emailed me. I sent him the info needed and told him he needs documentation before he can come in and record anything.   Two weeks go by and today I hear from him again. He needs more info, and wants to record sometime next week, and apparently has documentation that I haven’t seen yet. It’s a lot of work to move a kid around so that this guy can work with him 1:1 for TWO days AND I have to be in the room while he’s doing it since he’s not a certified staff member in our district, or any district for that matter. Would I be TA if I told him no, he can’t record and will have to find somewhere else? I have a lot going on as it is, and I wanted to help, but he keeps doing this on short notice and he always seems to need more and more info from me, but I don’t want him to possibly fail this assignment because I said no. WIBTA?\n",
      "I'm engaged to my fiance (Sam/41) and we're getting married soon. I will say that he was married before and had a 13 year old son who passed away 4 years ago. Let me tell you he is still pretty much grieving, not judging him for that but his grieving can and will cloud his thinking sometimes.  We're currently in the wedding planning phase, he asked that we \"reserve\" a chair at the venue for his deceased son. I was dumbfounded when I heard this but he said that he knows his son will be there for him spriritually and he'd like to reserve a seat for him out of respect and to make him feel \"included\", I tried to be gentle because this seemed insane and told him we can't do that because guests will be asking questions and will think he's mentally unstable. I asked him to let go of this idea but he offered a compromise by leaving the last chair (in the very back) empty so no one will notice. I felt uneasy and asked him to just let it go but he kept bringing it up saying he gets a say since it's his wedding and his son was and will always be family, I had a fight with him telling him it's my wedding too and I don't people to laugh at us. he said I have nothing to lose if I say yes and that I'm being selfish. I snapped and told him to get over himself and he got quiet suddenly and stopped arguing then shut down completely. I then heard him sob while he was smoking outside and refused to speak to me, didn't even let me sit with him. he has been like this eversince the fight and has been avoiding me. I could have blown this out of propotion but I thought his request will weird out many guests and make our wedding a laughing stock.   editing to add that I didn't think that such thing was common. I admit that I should've handled the conversation better but the guests I was referring to are my male cousin, they're terrible and make fun of everything and take every opportunity to turn an event into a laughing stock. I can't keep them from attending because they're family but at the same time don't want to give them a chance to hurt Sam's feelings or make rude comments. I love Sam and sympathize with his struggle but I feel like he's being dismissive of my feelings and thoughts.\n",
      "My daughter (20) works for a large retailer.   A little history:  she is a beautiful and funny girl, but she’s immature and spent most of her teen years under psychiatric care.   She has a personality of always being a victim and can never stand for anyone to have any attention besides herself.   She turns every family function into a dramatic performance of how everyone (her siblings and cousins) all reap the benefits of our praises and she’s just a loser.   As I said: she’s 20. High school dropout.   Is supposed to be taking Prozac daily but always skips doses.  She doesn’t drive and doesn’t want to.   No schooling and whines and complains about how life is not fair.   She technically lives at home but stays at her boyfriend’s (good guy) house most nights.   We require her to deposit money into a savings account we have for her in lieu of rent. I love her and she is every breath I breathe, but sometimes those breaths can feel like asthma attacks.   She’s always had this mouth that has little respect for superiors (teachers, managers and even myself).   According to her, everyone hates her and is always on HER case.   I just can’t figure out how I could have gone wrong with her.  Her other siblings are not like this.   They are doing well in school and haven’t had any issues socially or educationally. Today she called me crying because she got reprimanded at work for something small.   The problem is that her attitude and mouth make smaller situations worse.   They basically told her, after being there for 2 years, that she could quit or get back to work.   I listened for a while without saying much until she asked my opinion on the issue.   And I was honest with her.   The problem with that is that she started yelling at me and screaming that she called me for support and not to be further criticized.    I feel like an asshole.   My husband believes I did the right thing, but she’s angry with me and I’m angry with myself.   I know she has mental issues, and I can tell when she’s off her meds.  I just don’t know what I can do for her anymore.     I love her with every beat of my heart, but as I type this my heart hurts.    I know it could be worse.   She could be a criminal or a drug addict or worse.    But she’s never going to get anywhere if she doesn’t learn to control her temper with managers and people with authority.   She knows I’ll always have her back when she’s not in the wrong, but she also knows I don’t stand for bullshit.  Tl;dr: My daughter almost got fired at work and instead of being sympathetic, I pointed out to her that she handled the situation immaturely.  Update: as is frequently the case, she texted me with the following: “I know now that I’ve calmed down I’m in the wrong. I don’t want to talk about it , I already feel bad enough as it is. I’m sorry for the way I talked to you.  I love you.“\n",
      "While we weren't close before, after divorcing my mom i can't really stand him. He wasn't the worst person ever, he would provide(my mom did too) and be kind of present. I didnt really realized how manipulative he until i moved out When i went to college we found out he always lied to us about how much money he made, was very manipulative with my mom, and maybe to me too. That he cheated on my mom i could forgive, but we weren't allowed to buy nice things or to go out to eat, because he said he didnt make that much money. When i went to college i worked but they helped me too, but it turned our to be only mom was sending me that money and when he went to deposit he kept a part of that and used it to go to spas, hotels, dinners and expensive gifts for his mistress. After everything blew up when we found that he tried to do the same he always did, that my should forgive him because he would change blah blah. He came back to the house didnt work for a month because HE was sad, and then we found out he was still with the other relationship he refused to go away so my mom caved and she moved but he didnt give her anything from the house because \"she left\" when i visit my hometown i dont really feel like visiting him because he still does this kind of things. He' always manipulative and invasive and always knows how to guiltrip me. But when im in college he doesnt even asks how i am for months. I tried giving him a second chance (and a third) but he always behaves the same way.  AITA for not wanting to see him?  (Sorry for my english)\n",
      "Today my dad made Lentils' stew and he was so proud of his plate because he wanted to make it for such a long time (It has lentils, meat, red chorizo; a recipe form my country that it takes time), but we, me and my sister, don't like Lentils. I'm not usually a picky eater, but there's a few things like lentils that i don't like, but my sister is a strong picky eater. Since my dad was very happy with his plate and it took him a lot of time, I ate it for him mostly altough i didn't enjoy it, but my sister strongly refused to even try it, and that made my dad a little bit sad, but he knew her so he resigned. I started to telling her that at least she can try it or something to make dad happy, but she keept telling me no. I got mad because i ate a little bit of it, even if i don't like it but she can't do something like that for our dad. We fight a little bit in the middle of the table, and she even cry a little bit, so finally i gave up.  What it gets me mad, is that she always do what she wants to do; I keept telling her that she need to be a little bit of  permissive in the things that she doesn't want to do because sometimes we need to do it in order to keep a certain peace in the house, but  she always refuses.  ^(Sorry for any  grammar mistake  in my post)\n",
      "Here it goes.   On Friday morning our puppy escaped from our back yard (an 8 month French bulldog). He was left alone for approximately 30 minutes. We’ve had him for about 2 months and never had any issues with him escaping. He loved to dig holes, and we discovered this is how he made his escape. But up until that point, they weren’t along the fence line.  Anyway, I notice he is gone and immediately begin walking the neighborhood looking for him. The wife took the car and started going through other neighborhoods. We had no luck.  Fast forward to yesterday (Sunday). We receive a call from an vet office that someone had turned in our dog on Saturday morning (he is microchipped).   Fantastic news, so me and the wife jump in the car (still Sunday morning) and go pick up our pup.   We get to the vet clinic and they tell us that he is okay and that they’re getting him from the back now. The worker then sits down at the desk and prints off a bill.  The lady hands me a bill for $60. I look at it, and ask “is something wrong with him?”  She replied something like “well typically we don’t charge if they pick up the animal same day, but since we boarded him overnight, we charged you $60 for that, as well as food.”  And that did NOT go well. I was very pissed. They received our pup on Saturday, but we didn’t get the call until Sunday morning. We live 10 minutes from this clinic.   I told her that there was no way in hell I’m paying a bill when they chose to wait a day to call us.   By this this time, there were multiple workers at the desk who had walked up. The senior worker jumped in and said that they can’t return the pup to us until we pay the bill.   I told her that if they did not give us back our dog that I would call the police right then and there for holding my animal hostage for a bogus charge. I am not going to be conned into paying $60 when you waited to call us an entire day.  We got our pup back, but my wife says we should have just paid the bill.   Reddit, AITA?  Edit: to add more info, because a lot of people are asking fair questions.    the chip company we use has a 24 hour hotline number. They advertise a turn around of 15-20 minutes.    the dog was brought in Saturday a little before lunch but we did not receive a call until Sunday at around 10:00 am. The clinic is 24 hours.     we have been working on the holes. We have been taking him to a trainer and doing everything she said to try to stop it. We have not been shrugging it off.\n",
      "This was awhile back, but is still on my mind.... I called my friend \"X\" a few weeks ago to hang out. He said sure, why not, and said that a few other friends would be over to hang out for the afternoon. I showed up, we waited for the others, and we sat around talking for a bit.  Well, one of our buddies decides to call a girl over...and uh, let's just say they're all thirsty for her, so they're alllll over her. I have 0 interest in her, but I remained respectful of her, granted my opinion of her isn't all that high...  So, we walked to her place. The entire walk consisted of them talking to her, basically. I tried telling a joke about a remark one of our friends made, and he tells me, in a \"joking\" manner to shut up, because \"you're not funny.\"   ...Yeah. ok. Sure.  Then we get to her place. Which, surprisingly, consists of them surrounding her and talking to her about cool shit they've done..... all while ignoring me. I really didn't know what to say at this point.   It was about 20 minutes after this that I started leaving. Well, they started to slowly leave too...oddly enough (thought they would have stayed longer). By the time they all left I was wayyyyy ahead of them, because alllll they could talk about was her ass. No joke.  Then friend X decides to ask me the next day why \"I was an asshole about leaving/ why I was impatient.\"   .....\n",
      "Please read the entire post before saying im the asshole.  Backstory: I (28f) and Lilly (28f) have been best friends since we were 10 years old. Im married and shes in a serious long-term relationship for 5 years. Lillys bf Phil works at a used car dealership. I asked lilly and phil about 2 weeks ago if they knew of a reliable vehicle that i could buy for about 2500-3000. They told me yes, and proceeded to tell me about a 2008 buick enclave for $3000. Phil said he was buying it from his boss and still owed on it and that i could pay off what he owed and give him the rest of money and the car would be mine. I agreed to this deal.  Flash forward to Friday. I go out to the dealership to buy this car off of Phil. I wait for over an hour and phil and his boss decide to just let me buy the car from the dealership for the full price that phil was going to buy it for (3669) which is higher than what Phil and Lilly originally told me. I tried to talk to phil and told him if he just took the cash and paid it off, i would pay for his sales tax and the title fee and he could keep the rest of the money like we originally agreed to. He told me no and went with me buying it from the dealership. I said okay, paid for it, signed all the paperwork, and drove the car home. I spent over 3 hours out there and not once did anyone mention having cold feet about selling it or anything.   Yesterday, i get a text from lilly wanting me to take the car back and she said they would buy the car back from me. I told her im sorry but i really like this car and im keeping it. That the time to change your mind about selling me this car was before i paid for it not afterwards.  She then told me that his boss said they arent going to give phil anymore deals unless the car i paid for goes back. I again apologized and said no.   Today, i get a text from lilly still wanting me to take the car back. Again, i told her im sorry but i really like the car and im keeping it.   Am i the asshole for not taking my car back? I really dont want to loose my friendship and wanna make sure im not in the wrong.\n",
      "I 28F am childfree and through the years I've been told the same BS and then some.   \"You'll change your mind when you meet the right man\"  \"Who'll care for you when you're older?\"  \"You'll change your mind when you're older/the right man comes along\"  And so many more, and TBH it gets on my nerves.   So now I just say \"Well, we'll see\", or I just stopped saying I was childfree and say \"Who knows\" when I'm asked why I'm single and have no children. There's no way to dodge these phrases which just makes for an awkward moment. So I basically smile and wave.   If you wanna have kids, go for it. I personally don't believe in bringing a child into this world if I know I'm not gonna care for them as they deserve. That and I have mental health issues I'm not burdening a kid with, so why risk it.  I was talking on the phone with my guy friend Max, the conversation turned to kids and when he asked me why I didn't have any I mentioned that my dad has been hounding me for the past 8 years or so that he wants a grandchild from me cause I'm his youngest daughter. My family knows I'm childfree, and I embrace my maternal side through my nibblings. To me being childfree means I don't want any of my own, but I don't actively hate kids.   I've told dad on many occasions, \"If you want a grandchild so bad I'll go make one and bring it back home to you, so you can do as you please with the baby\"   He says no, that it's a big responsibility he's not gonna take, he just wants a grandkid. Meaning that he wants to play grandpa on Sunday afternoons while I'm frankly, stuck with a child I don't want  I told my friend this and as if on cue, he gave me the whole speech mentioned above.   I told him that if I took dad on his word of having a kid, it'd technically be a bastard because I'm not getting married just so my dad can live out his happy grandpa fantasy, especially when he has 8 grandkids and one great grandson already.   My friend said something like \"That's effing messed up, how anyone can express themselves like that of their own child, you don't deserve the privilege of being a mother, there's something wrong with your way of thinking. Not to mention you'll end up alone with no one to care for you\"   I replied \"I've been literally saying for years I don't want to be a mother and the child in question doesn't even exist and won't exist, so why are you giving me crap for it? Also, if they're being born out of wedlock, they're technically a bastard\". I didn't mean it as an insult, and I've given this reasoning before. This does not mean I go around calling every child a bastard, it's not my business, I only use it for \"myself\" to bring my point across.   The conversation turned sour, now I'm an AH by calling a nonplanned, nonexistant child a bastard.   I let him go shortly after but the air was still tense.   I now feel bad.\n",
      "Mobile  So I’m on spring break with my girlfriend and her dad, and we drove by an ice cream place where my girlfriend said she wanted some ice cream. Her dad said maybe later, and the subject was dropped. Later at dinner she asked about the ice cream, and her dad responded with “ive paid for everything this week, we’re going home after this, no ice cream.” My girlfriend responded with “but you said later,” an her dad turned to me and said, “did I say that?” I simply said I didn’t remember, not wanting to choose sides or whatever, but my girlfriend hasn’t spoken to me since. AITA?\n",
      "I know this is a petty one but I feel like it’s justified. just want to know if I’m an asshole for it.  So my father and mother have fallen in love with Yeti brand cups. If you don’t know what they are, they’re insulated cups that have clear lids, and are INCREDIBLE at keeping your drink scalding hot or keeping your ice alive for two days straight. I’ll refrain from turning this into an ad but more or less everyone in my house has one, now that I was given one for Christmas. They aren’t cheap cups. All our cups take the same lids and here where the asshole part may come in.  My cup and lid are the newest. I really like it so I’ve been making sure to take really good care of it. Washing it between every drink, not letting it sit unless it’s just water inside, keeping my lid with my cup, making sure the lid is clean, which is important. The lids have a rubber strip around the edges that keeps it close to airtight. All of the other lids in the house have some kind of mold or some other damage to the strip because everyone has a tendency to wash their dishes later on or just not wash their lid for a while if they have the same drink over and over.  Like I said, I’ve been keeping good care of mine because the the idea of having mold in my drink from the lid makes he want to barf and never drink from a yeti again. I ALWAYS use and clean my own lid for that reason and I’ve yet to have a problem.  Last night I mistakenly left my clean lid on the counter after getting some water, but since it’s water and I wasn’t headed to my room, I figured I’d grab it when I washed my cup, but forgot to.   This morning, I go to make my tea but my lid is nowhere to be found. I am NOT using a moldy lid so I looked around before asking my brother (who keeps his lids dirty and on his cup for weeks mind you, to give you an idea on how they get treated in our house) and father if they had my lid.   My dad affirmed that he had mine, but told me to go use a different one. I explained that no, I want my lid for my cup. He looked at me like I was asking for a million dollars, and told me no, that I could use one that was in the drawer. I said “No, id like mine please. All the others have mold on the edges and I really don’t want to use them.”  My dad proceeded to loudly go “WOOOOOW” and hand me my lid and act like I was a horrible person for asking for mine back or like i was trying to force feed him his moldy lid instead of letting him use mine. My mother agreed and told me I could have just used one of theirs. I explained that my lid is the only ones that isnt moldy or gross (I even showed her the mold on the other lids) because Ive actually been taking care of it well. She said I was being ridiculous and petty and should have used one of theirs.  Everyone aside from my brother is mad at me now for being petty, but honestly I feel like it’s a justified pettiness because I truly cannot stomach the idea of using a moldy lid.\n",
      "My (24F) sister (39F) has two children who are 4 and 7, I myself have an 8 month old baby.  My sister, Lucy (fake name) is going through a difficult time with her husband as he lost his job and she’s working a bunch of hours, she couldn’t look after the children and her husband wouldn’t, I’ve suggested a divorce but she won’t listen to me.  I’ve had the children for 4 months now, she visits them at the weekends.  This is where the problem arises; I’ve been taking them zoo, playground, shopping, I’ve even got them Santa and Christmas presents sorted since I’m meant to have them till March (even if I don’t have them Christmas they’re sorted since she didn’t show up on Halloween)  I got them some clothes, shoes, a slide and swing set for outside, a trampoline, an art set each, some books, a dollhouse, a few stuffed toys, a new tablet, a little bracelet and a little pretend DIY set and a lot more other things that I can’t list right now   So I sent a picture of what I got them to my sister who I expected to be pleased that her children are sorted for Christmas since I’ve already bought some presents from her as a just in case.  This has led to a  huge  argument that has carried on till today.  She accused me of spoiling them and pretending to be their mother  I’ve asked my boyfriend who agrees with her that I shouldn’t spoil them as much and that I am acting like their mother which is TA move because my sister probably feels guilty about not having as much money as I do and not being able to look after them since she has to work   AITA?\n",
      "So I (22) live with my parents. We have always lived next to the same people my entire life and never had any issues. The eldest boy (33) has recently moved back next door and is always playing loud music and in turn the youngest one (19/20) is too. I am always messaging them and knocking on the door asking them to turn down the music. They do for a little while and turn it up or put it back to the same volume next time. Its getting so frustrating. We've never had this issue before. I've tried to ignore them and wear headphones but unless I want to destroy my ears I can still hear it. Their mum doesn't live with them at the moment.   Wibta for contacting their landlord or even police over this matter?  Edit: I'm in the UK, anti social hours are 11pm till 7am and they've only played music past 11 a couple times. I'm not sure if it's loud enough to be classed as a disturbance but it is a disturbance to us.\n",
      "My birthday is one day before my half-brother's. He was born on the 24th, I was born on the 23rd. We have the same dad but not the same mom.  Ever since I was a child, we had to celebrate our birthdays together. The entire family was invited. But honestly, it never felt like my birthday. My grandma loved him more than any other of her grandchildren. Ditto with my dad : he was his firstborn and they had a lot of things in common. He had the best gifts, the best cakes, all the attention was directed towards him. I never said anything. I'm the lastborn of my family so I had to suck it up. Plus, my half-brother was a really good guy so I knew it wasn't his fault. He loved me a lot too, like I was his real sister.  Sadly, my half-brother passed 3 years ago in a tragic way. His death was traumatic for everyone in my family, and especially for me. However, I had to grieve alone. Everyone was focused on their own pain, especially my dad, my mom, my half-brother's mom and his girlfriend. So I never cried in front of them. Never said anything. I listened to their complains and tried to do my best to help everyone.  Here's where I might be considered TA by my family : since he passed away, my birthday became a way for everyone to celebrate HIS birthday. and remember him They invite his mom, his GF, and all they do is talk about how great he was. Sometimes we have cake. But that's it. I loved my half-brother but I cannot do this anymore. I'm 24. I never liked having to share my birthday as a kid. I don't want to have to share my birthday with a ghost. But I know it matters to my family to be able to keep this tradition and to celebrate him.  WIBTA for not wanting to celebrate my birthday anymore?\n",
      "I (14f) have lived exclusively with my mom since I was born. My dad has never really been in my life, aside from occasional visits (once every few months.) When I tell my friends that I live with my mom only and that he’s not in my life they usually think that means that he walked out when I was younger, which isn’t the case. My parents were never married and I’m not sure they ever dated. All I know about their relationship is that they agreed that they’d have a baby, and that my mom would have full custody, be my main provider, and basically be my only parent. Basically my dad got to cum n run without having to provide for his new kid. He’s only been in about 1% of my life overall, and he’s missed a lot. He’s never lived with my mom and I and I’ve never even been to his house or work. Needless to say he’s missed a lot of my life. All of my birthdays, performances, concerts, even my Bat Mitzvah. Now he hasn’t been completely distant though. He still calls my mom every once in a while In hopes of seeing me. He tries to meet up with me when he’s off work, which I appreciate, but all the conversations we have seem so fake, since my mom is always there hovering over us. (It’s probably worth mentioning that they despise each other) I guess I should cut to the chase. I know that he’s trying, but I can’t get over the fact that he’s missed so much of my life. And seeing each other makes my mom and dad unhappy, and I don’t want either of them to be unhappy because I forced them to see each other. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "So I (32M) have been married to my wife Allie (33F) for 5 years. Her dad was a restaurant/business owner and her mom was SAHM. Both of Allie’s sisters got married to very successful guys and had kids. At the beginning of our relationship I was starting my own construction business. I wasn’t making a ton of money and Allie’s parents hated it. Her sisters always tried to set Allie up with their husbands friends. Her father disapproved of our wedding and forced Allie to ask for a prenup if she wanted help with the wedding. Allie also asked for us to have separate finances. We have had a loving marriage so far even with the rocky start. But whenever she visits her family I tend to not go.   So Allies dad made some bad investments, got screwed by his partner and his business took big losses. Due to this him and his wife are struggling to retire like they hoped. Allie sisters came up with a surprise for their parents on their 40 wedding anniversary. They would pay off their house and send them on a vacation to celebrate retirement. Whole thing would cost about 30K. Each sister would be responsible for 10K. Allie has always paid for things regarding her family and I pay for mine. She gets along with my parents however and will buy things for them sometimes. So Allie is a school teacher and when she found out the plan she asked me for 8k. I literally laughed. I said her parents were awful to me, thought I was a broke loser and you asked for a prenup. That our finances were separate because she asked for it and I don’t plan on changing it. Allie said she didn’t have the money right now but would pay me back. Which I know is BS and isn’t something I’d consider anyway. As I intend to not help her family out in anyway.   Allie and her sisters got on a zoom call to talk about it. I was called into the meeting and asked by the sisters to have some empathy. I told them I made my decision and then was berated. Her sisters went off how I’m holding a grudge still, how I should be willing to help my wife and how it’s just money. I said how neither of them have worked a day in their life (ones a STAM and one divorced their doctor husband and gets alimony). How neither of them gave me a chance 6 years ago. How neither of them are using their money either, just using their husbands like they always do. That Allie asked for a prenup because their dad thought I was a loser and now he needs my help. That Allie should managed her money better. I told them both never to ask me for a favor again.   After we got off the call Allie said she feels like I’m being unfair and petty. That I’ve helped my parents out before. (Which is true I bought my dad a new 30K truck about a year ago). I said that’s because my “silly” business took off and I can afford to do those things. And that her parents are her responsibility and I don’t owe them a thing. My parents think while I’m not in the wrong, laughing at my wife’s request was kinda an AH move. AITA?  Edit: Yes her parents tried apologizing. But I have a feeling this is only because my business took off. They try to invite me to come to holidays and stuff but I don’t respond.\n",
      "Edit to add kids age  I work from home and my cousin (36f) lives a five minute drive away. During the pandemic my cousin's business had to downsize and while she kept her job, she lost a big chunk of her paycheck.  I volunteered to take care of her kids (9f and 5m) at no pay during their loose hours. Before school for two hrs and after until she arrives. As she's gotten busier this and has escalated to them spending nights over. I've attended PT meetings, gone for bake sales etc. Which I've enjoyed so far.  A week ago she got off work early and joined me and the kids on a trip to a supermarket. The daughter had previously insisted she skip lunch despite asking her several times. I decided not to force her but said I wouldn't buy any snacks for her and she would eat when we got back home, a round trip of maybe 45 minutes to an hour.   When we got to the supermarket, my niece saw a chips with a Pikachu package and said she wanted it. I reminded her what we'd said and she went postal. Shrieking in the aisle, threw herself on the ground but I said no. My cousin who'd been in a different aisle rushed over picked her up and stormed out with the kids.  She called me later, saying that I'm cheap. I'm terrorizing her kids coz I'm jealous I can't have any (after two miscarriages and a still birth I had a hysterectomy) I don't know how to care for kids that's why I don't have any. My aunt and her have hunted down anyone in the family who'll support them and called a family meeting which I don't want to attend because I don't think my actions deserve this.  This situation seemed like such a no brainer but I'm catching so much flack for it and my family and friends are saying the most hurtful things that I'm doubting my actions that day. So Reddit AITA?\n",
      "I’ve known this person sense high school. Her father is a part of the cult I grew up in, and she suffers from a lot of the same mental illnesses that I do. I guess those things brought us together.  (What is said in this post is only the most recent of the issues, but I’m not going into the others for her privacy.)  Recently she made a big deal about me not messaging or calling her first. I don’t do that for anyone I talk to, not even my romantic partners. My anxiety takes over and I think I’m going to be bothering that person, even when they say I’m not, so in order to stop my anxiety from fucking with me I’ve made it clear to everyone I talk to that they have to message/call first and it hasn’t been that much of an issue.  Well after I explained, again, that my anxiety won’t let me message first a lot, she said okay and that was that. After she made suck a big deal about it, I tried my best to override my anxiety and message her first. I did that for a few weeks with little to no response.   Then she comes out of no where and sends me a Snapchat that says “we need to call soon”. I’ve been trying to, but you haven’t had time, or you haven’t responded to me for days on end. But now that all your other friends are busy, you want to call.   I’ve told her before that I feel like her filler friend because she would only call or text me when someone else wasn’t responding, or if she needed to ask me to look at screenshots and tell her if her other friend is mad at her. She didn’t like me saying that and disagreed but didn’t do anything at all to make me feel like it wasn’t true. Even now, a year-ish after that ‘filler friend’ conversation, I feel like shit hasn’t changed.   So I ask, AITA for thinking I need to break off this friendship?\n",
      "We were in a small-ish town in Virginia the other day (we’re from Georgia but we’re visiting family).  We were driving back home with our parents, and we stopped at a small store to like get some food because we were hungry. It wasn’t like a gas station store or like a QuikTrip or anything, more like a mom-and-pop type store.  Anyhow, my brother and I went into the store,  got some food, and went to pay. The person in front of us seemed to know the person behind the counter, and they chatted for a few minutes pretty familiarly. She happened to be short a few dollars but he let her go because he knew that she was ‘good for it’.  My brother and I had cash, but we didn’t have cash for everything, so he asked if we could go to the car and ask our parents to get the extra few dollars. The guy behind the counter said no because we might run off.   My brother got upset, and once we were back in the car he said that guy was probably racist and that’s why he let someone else off but not us (the person he let off was white, we’re Asian). I pointed out they seemed to know each other, and obviously the cashier didn’t know us, so he can trust someone he knows but not somebody he doesn’t. It could just as easily be that, not the fact that that woman was white.   He got mad at this because I was ‘invalidating’ his experiences. I was just offering another perspective on what happened.   AITA?\n",
      "My friend literally bugs me to hang out every weekend and can not take no for an answer. Last weekend I told him he couldn’t come to my house because I already had too many people over before we were going to head to a school event, which he would also be at. This was completely true. After the school event, he proceeded to show up to my house without an invite. This weekend, on Friday, I explained to him my mom wasn’t letting me go out this weekend because of my tremendous workload. I told him I’d ask my mom anyway. I asked her in front of him and she Point blank said no. Literally the day after he asked if I still wasn’t allowed out. I said yes, sorry I’m still not allowed out. He continues to call me and text me, asking me why I can’t go out, and what I’m doing, after I’ve already explained to him all of it. He asks me to hang out every weekend, and while I do enjoy his company, it’s got to the point where it is making me really annoyed. I feel like at this point I HAVE TO say something or else he’ll never stop and potentially ruin our friendship. Am I the asshole for saying something like this?\n",
      "Whenever a specific event I'm interested in comes out, I am one to purchase a ticket for the very first showing available; it is kinda my thing. This was no exception, however I would be in a different country visiting a friend. Said friend was invited when the ticket was purchased and they declined saying they don't like said events. I purchased the solo ticket and that was that.   About a week ago, friend said they needed to travel 5 hours to a nearby city for work and would not be back until the next evening. You guessed it! Same day as the event. They asked if I wanted to travel with them, and I said I would consider it but not likely. I looked for another ticket but was having no luck as most showings were already sold. I told them I would see them when they got back in town, since I had no luck finding another ticket. Friend seemed indifferent at the moment so no hard feelings were had.  Event was fantastic! No regrets on going when I did. However, after the event let out I offered to fly out and meet up with friend so we could spend the evening together and then drive back together the next day. Now friend wants to have feelings after the fact and refuses to tell me where they are staying so I don't show up and surprise them. I felt it was a decent compromise and both of us weren't missing out on much, but apparently I've got terrible priorities and the damage is done. Friend states they are pissed off and annoyed with me, and I'm finding it hard to understand since everything seemed cool prior. I understand where they are coming from but I'm willing to pay heaps to meet in the middle and make things right, but that just isn't good enough and I'm still the asshole?\n",
      "I have a friend (G). Partner and I have helped her with a lot - financially and emotionally (made doctor's appts, paid vet bills, paid her electric bill, bought her food, etc).   &#x200B;  Back in March, G started talking to a man, P, who was going to buy a house in our area, and rent it for $750/month (3 bed, 2 bath house in California, mind you) to G. Two weeks ago, P sent G a standard rental lease, which included: a cleaning deposit, a note that rent might increase by 10% for each year she lives there after the first year, a hard limit to no more animals, the requirement that any other adults (18+ years old) must be added to the rental contract if they move in with her, and that there would be inspections of the property.  &#x200B;  G called P on speakerphone while I was sitting next to her. She yelled(!!) at P that his rules were shit, and went off. P tried to tell her this was a standard rental lease, she yelled at him again, told him to go fuck himself, and she didn't want the house and he could rent it to whoever he wanted. She hung up on him, and when he called back, she answered the phone with \"Fuck you, P, I don't want anything to do with you again. Don't ever contact me.\"  &#x200B;  My partner and I are looking for a new place to rent, too (under hard deadline). We reached out to P last Tuesday. I asked if he was renting the house he'd bought to G. P said he never would. I asked him to reconsider, letting him know she was under a lot of stress. P said that the way she spoke to & treated him was unacceptable & that he wasn't going to rent to her. We asked P if he would rent to us. He said he would, at fair market value for the place. I tried to talk to G every day, but she never responded to anything.  &#x200B;  After a week of ignoring P, G called P up and asked when she could plan on moving into the house. P told her that he was going to rent to us instead, as he didn't want her as a tenant  .  G got upset with me, and began yelling at me for being such a bad friend. She said that P would never have rented to us if I hadn't \"stolen it\" out from under her . She told me I was a shitty person and an asshole, and that she couldn't believe I was going to make her and her children homeless etc.   &#x200B;  I told G that friends don't talk to each other like that. She said, \"Well I guess I'm not your friend, cause I'll say whatever the fuck I want and if you don't like it, we ain't friends.\" I told G, \"We don't have to be friends. But since you're no longer my friend, I need to know when you'll be making payments on the car we've been letting you drive since March.\" G hasn't said a thing to me since.  &#x200B;    AITA for taking a rental that she took herself out of the running for?    AITA for telling her that friends don't scream at each other, call them bitches and two faced, and that we couldn't maintain a friendship if this is how she chose to treat me?    AITA for telling her that if she does not begin to make payments on the car, we will be repossessing it?\n",
      "I could not think of a good title for this.   so a few years ago I was being abused by someone, I decided to take it to the counselor and get help and so me and the counselor could get some evidence so we could take my abuser down.   I decided to ask my friends if they had ever seen this guy be abusive and one friend suddenly came out and said that he groped her a few weeks back and was scared to tell someone, I automatically started helping her and me and my friends helped her through this. we would go to counseling together and we worked a good case against him and presented it to the dean.   all was ok until a few days later it comes out that she lied for attention and all the evidence we had could not be used. even my stuff was thrown out as they thought I also lied.   I refused to talk to her after that because she made it easier for my abuser to hurt me and I suffered for her attention seeking.   it's been a few years and some people in the friend group want to invite her out, I explained why I'm against it and they used the \"she changed\" line.  a few friends are calling me a asshole for not giving her a second chance.  I now feel like garbage and now feel I should?  aita?\n",
      "Background- I play quite a few dynasty leagues, 2-3 of which are comprised of pieces of the same group of guys from college. They are all paid leagues, so money is on the line.  The last year or so our commissioner of the league in question has gotten lazy to say the least. Last off season our league voted by majority to move to a new platform; he said he would not be moving the league, someone else would have to do it. Because I was part of the group wanting to move I set up the league on the new platform and moved all the rosters over. It wasn’t the end of the world, but it was several hours of work moving 300+ players and 3-4 years worth of draft picks over to a new platform as well as getting all of the settings correct.  Each of the last 3 off seasons we have gotten all of our off season activities (draft lottery, end of year “banquet”, and voting on rules changes) done my Feb or early March at the latest. All of these things should be done earlyish in the offseason to give everyone time to prepare for the draft and next season.  This year several of us in the league asked about scheduling these events throughout Jan/Feb/March with no effort or real response (aside from “yea let’s do it”) from the commissioner. I posted a poll to find out what dates worked for people to get things done, sent that info in the group chat for commish to schedule it and nothing got done. Me and a few others sent messages ever week or two trying to start voting or at least figure out the draft order so guys could start making trades, but commish would always say he was too busy. One day a guy in the league said he would take care of the draft lottery, so at least we knew who was picking when, but that was yet another thing commish was too busy for. Finally the other day (3 months late) when we asked again to vote and set the draft up in the app we use he said “no it’s a bit at this point that I’m not doing anything”. So now we all know it’s not just scheduling conflicts, he is purposefully putting off his responsibilities because he was amused. A couple of us pushed back at him and I called him out.   He finally caved and begrudgingly set the draft order and time, but still has not set up polls for rule changes. He has been petty and passive aggressive about doing the 5 min of work it took him to set these things up and has taken shots at me over wanting to get things done. (In our other leagues this stuff has all been done for months) The draft was scheduled to start over 2 hours ago and is still set up incorrectly, but commish has not started it and will not respond to anyone.   I love this guy, he was my best man at my wedding but I’m strongly considering leaving the league at this point. AITA?\n",
      "I'm M18.  I was adopted by an couple who separated shortly after my adoption, and I eventually taken away from them and placed into foster care when I was 3. That's where I grew up.  Recently I've acquitted details about my biological parents from a family friend who helped connect them to my adoptive parents all those years ago. I looked them up online, they have three kids, a M15 and twin F13. The son has the same name as mine.   A few weeks ago I went to the church they go and saw them from a distance, didn't introduce myself, just wanted to see them before they knew who I am. Also figured out where they live, where the kids go to school, where they work, and some other general information.  About two weeks ago I finally sent a message to my mom, explaining who I am and telling her that I would like to meet them. She saw the message that day but didn't reply for a whole week, and then just sent a very short message telling me they're not interested to know more about me or to have me in their lives, to not contact her or her family ever again.  I sent a message to my dad then and he said we can have a phone call. We had that call last week. He didn't even let me tell him anything about myself, he explained that they had me when they were 22 and didn't want a child back then so they gave me to another couple and there's really is nothing for us to discuss. He said he doesn't want to know more about me and doesn't want to hear from me again.   I'm not going to lie this was difficult for me to hear and I had a few days to process it. But I get it. They didn't want me then and they don't want me now. I'm trying my best to get over it, but I still have three siblings. Maybe they would want to get to know me?  So I sent another message to my dad, thanked him for taking the time to speak with me and being frank about what he wants. I explained that I respect the fact that he and my mom don't want me in their lives and that's their choice and I will respect that, however I have three siblings and I would like to meet and get to know them. So I said I'm happy for them to tell the   He called me an hour later, this time he was angry and told me that he made it clear that I have no place in their family and I should stay away from all 5 of them forever. He said the kids don't know about me and it will stay that way. I wasn't expecting him to call me or the aggression so I was kind of shocked but I was like \"but that should be their choice\" and he said he's not going to discuss his family with me. Ended the call with saying \"do not contact any of us ever again.\"  WIBTA if I went to talk to my siblings, introduce myself and let them know they have an older brother? I'm obviously not trying to be an asshole here, but I don't think the parents get to make this decision about the children. I do want a relationship with my siblings (of course only if they want that too). If my siblings don't want to get to know me, I'll stay away from all of them.\n",
      "I (F24) got a text from my nephew (11) a couple months ago asking if I have tiktok and if I would add him on there.  I told him that no, I do not have tiktok, but to send me his tiktoks in the chat as I like seeing what he’s doing. (He makes tiktoks about building things from cardboard and making his own boardgames. I want to encourage his creativity).   I however do have tiktok. I made my account anonymous: it doesn’t mention my name, doesn’t show my face or voice.  I enjoy having a platform that isn’t a social media in the sense that friends and family watch what you like/share/make. It makes me feel safe and free to do whatever I want on there.   I especially follow body positive content and bisexual content. The bi thing is something that I’m figuring out for myself, and I’m in no way, shape or form ready to share anything about that with others yet. I also don’t want the algorithm to think I like watching kids stuff, so i didn’t want to follow for that reason as well. Tiktok is my safe space. I did not know how to properly explain that to my nephew as he is autistic and doesn’t really understand when you explain your feelings to him, and he gets upset easily when he feels he is being left out.  My parents know i have tiktok, because I sometimes show them funny videos I encounter. I told them what I told nephew and to not mention that I do have tiktok. They agreed.   Yesterday my aunt, uncle and nephew visited my hometown and came by me for lunch, and continued to my parents for dinner. Everything was fine, until my aunt called me, angry.   My mother had a slip of the tongue (no i do not blame her one bit) and said something like ‘oh OP watches tiktoks as well’. My nephew is understandably upset about me lying. I explained to my aunt why i didnt want to tell him ‘yes I do have tiktok but I don’t want to follow you’ so I opted to lie to spare his feelings and still have him share his content with me.   She hung up, still angry and yelling and i feel like such a douche.  Am I the asshole?\n",
      "For the people who want to see the ring and are interested in finding more about what will happen to my brothers wedding DM me and I will tell you my real reddit username. I will also send you a picture of the ring which is soooo pretty. My boyfriend better buy me the same ring when he proposes to me. Anyways, the story:  In case age is needed I am 18.  My brother told me he is planning to propose to his girl friend and wants me to come with him and choose a ring for her. This made me so happy because his girl friend is perfect for him and I get a long very well with her. I am sure they will both live so happily and build a great family. We found a really nice ring and I made a picture of it to show it to my mother. I was honestly just so excited about this that I felt the need to share it with everyone. I posted on Facebook about how happy I am that he is going to propose and also showed them the ring. My brother didn’t see the post but ended up finding out when his girl friend called him. He ended up having to propose on the phone. I felt awful for this. My brother was so mad at me. I have never seen him so upset. I got criticized by relatives as well for this. My brother told me that I ruined his plans and now refuses to tell me any future plannings he has in mind. I broke down and started crying.  My parents also shamed me for what I did. I know I made a mistake but I think my family is overreacting (his girl friend did end up saying yes in case anyone is wondering). The only one who understood me is his girl friend. She promised she will talk to him about it. I don’t think I deserve this much hate. What do you guys think?  &#x200B;  EDIT: For the people who Dm’d me to tell me I’m a narcissist piece of shit that should die and hoped I wouldn’t be invited to their wedding just because I was really happy my brother is getting married, I want you to know that you are what is wrong with todays society.

      "Last night, my older sister and I (we’re roommates/house together) got into a disagreement. The thing is- she yells at me during arguments. She has a habitual pattern of doing this (we grew up in a screaming household) and I have already spoken to her about how it’s unhealthy for our relationship and how it makes me feel bad on multiple occasions in the past. The argument was about the smallest thing (ordering sauce at the drive-thru) but she blew up over it anyways within seconds. Now, to be fair- at a certain point I started covering my ears. I normally don’t have a habit of doing this. This is the 2nd time I’ve done it and I know it’s immature. Emotionally, I just can’t handle the yelling anymore. I know I shouldn’t take it personal as she’s been struggling with depression and other life things recently, but I still did not like how she handled the situation.  Our nephew from our eldest sister was just born last night and our mother is taking care of our eldest sisters daughter in the mean time. We’re supposed to go over there so we can watch her while our mom gets ready so we can go see our sister at the hospital. We each have our own cars and I’m finding it difficult to be in the same space as my sister right now. I want to drive over there by myself, because even though my nephew being born is fantastic, I’m still upset with her for yelling at me yet again. I told her I was going to go by myself. She told me “Please wait- please don’t go. I’m almost done. Please don’t leave.” I said “I just need space.” She told me “Wow- I thought when I woke you up this morning you were going to be the bigger person. We can just drive in silence. Our nephew was just born. I thought you’d be more mature.”  This statement did not make me feel better, to say the least. Even more now, I didn’t want to be in the car with her because I felt so tense and certain the car ride wouldn’t be silent. I’d rather just hold it till later when I’m able to discuss the yelling with her at a better time. I want to celebrate my nephew being born instead.  AITA for personally still being upset and holding onto my position (she’s wrong, I’m right) if we both we’re wrong about how we handled the argument?  Upd: We talked about it after seeing our nephew. She brought up last night, and from her side, she got triggered because a past bf would constantly blame her when anything would go wrong for him and knows that was why she was being defensive. Regardless, she didn’t use that as an excuse, just as a reason, and proceeded to own up to her response. Thank you all for taking the time to read/respond\n",
      "I've worked at a Dairy Queen for a year and recently put in my 2 weeks. The manager, Chris, yells at everyone because he feels they dont fit his OCD and germaphobic lifestyle.

He makes mistakes and seems to have no joy in his job.\"  I am a 16 yo Junior in high school working at his first job. He pays me way too little ($8.50/hr) and works me way too much.

      "I'm 28f and due to this drama, I feel like I've traveled back in time to HS. I dont necessarily feel like the AH in this equation but I've gotten some mixed opinions on it (I reached out on another social media forum under anonymous to get some unbiased feedback) and well, here I am.  So, I used to be friends with this kid in HS. His name was Alex and he was a grade below me. He dated my best friend for a good majority of our school years and there was nothing aside from a platonic friendship between the both of us. After I graduated in 2010 we lost touch but continued to have eachother as friends on FB and Instagram.  The last time I spoke to Alex was back in 2015 when my baby brother was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Alex was one of the few individuals who donated to my brothers GoFundMe page and it was, if I remember correctly, a pretty large amount of money that he selflessly handed over for a boy he didnt know. Our last conversation was me thanking him for his generous donation and we spoke for maybe 5 minutes following the thank yous.   In the beginning of this year Alex started dating a girl named Heather. Keep in mind please that I have been in a steady and stable relationship for going on 4 years at this point. I was respectful, as I know a lot of people become jealous over nothing. So I didnt like any of his posts or reach out to him or anything of the sort. He doesnt like any of my shit either on FB. However, his girlfriend reached out to me about a week ago and said \"I dont feel comfortable with you being on Alex's FB. Delete him, please.\" When I asked her why, she stated \"Its personal. I dont need to share why. Please just delete him so I can have a piece of mind.\" I told her if she didnt have a good reason than no, I wouldnt delete him, as hes always been a good friend and as I said above, he helped my brother out tremendously with his donation which makes me have a huge amount of respect for him. She was livid. Called me a slut. Said that I was deliberately making her uncomfortable because I'm nothing but an AH who \"feeds off of people's insecurities.\" I blocked her.   So the people I got feedback from are basically split 50/50. Some of them think I'm an AH and should just delete the guy off my FB to spare this girls feelings. Others however think that I shouldnt because this guy and myself have never had anything to do with eachother aside from a friendship basis and taken into consideration his donation, it would make me look bad.   AITA?  Update: Hey all! Sorry, I was at work and didnt have time to respond to most of you. I did take your advice though and sent Alex screen shots of Heather's messages. I have asked him to kindly speak to Heather about the matter, which he was more than happy to do as he appeared to be mortified. Thus far I have not heard anything back.\n",
      "So about a month ago my stepmom started refusing to let my dad see her phone, was leaving the house way more often than she ever did, and straight up just treating my dad like complete trash; yelling at him for nothing, not being thankful for him cooking dinner, not even sleeping in the same bed as him.   He's been understandably torn up and angry about it, and confided in me about it all. Since then I've ignored her texts, Facebook posts she tags me in, everything.   Today is my birthday and I didn't respond to her birthday wish to me and she angrily texted me asking why the hell I'm ignoring her all the time. I have no intention to talk to her, because if I do, I won't be saying anything nice. Am I the asshole?\n",

When it was around 2 my dad comes around and tells me that I need to be picked up now (or 2:30) or he won’t be able to until 6-7 and that he can’t come back in fourth from town to town.  Let’s say me and Diana don’t have the best relationship. I don’t do anything wrong I just do things that she doesn’t like (like grabbing a few bags instead of a whole box to fill up a 1 of the 2 fry hopper) so she’s constantly on my butt for it and all I can do is smile along when my other bosses don’t care and as-long as I do my job and do it right it’s ok.   So back to the story I need to get off at 2:30 Becuase that’s my only way home and when I tell Diana about it she gets mad and tells me that I can’t leave (only for her to say I can leave now) so I feel bad but I can’t do anything about it   Now I’m at home and I do think IATA\n",
      "I (32f) have been married to my husband (34m) for about 4 months.  We were in a long distance relationship for 2 years before we got married. We got married in my home country and after 3 weeks moved back to where he is from.  We have both been working on a visa to get me to his country prior to getting married, but there are still a few things to get done. Lately I have been delaying my requirements because a month after we got married my mother got hospitalized and got diagnosed with cancer. She has  had 2 operations since and the doctor told me that for one she was 6 hours away from dying. He doesn't understand why I can't just move on with the requirements for the visa, I told him I would do it after the holidays. So reddit AITA for wanting to just atleast spend this holiday with my family? I'm not sure if my mother will have any more of them.\n",
      "So that sounds ridiculous, hence why using a throwaway account.  So, my partner and I have a tendency to order from a certain kebab shop. They do the best cheese sauce I've ever had in my life. However, you have to pay to add it to any part of your order. It costs about 80 cents to a dollar, depending on if the order is for collection or delivery. As this cheese sauce is absolutely gorgeous, we add it to the kebabs and fries as an extra. We tried to find alternatives in the shops but nothing compares to it.  So over the past few orders, the shop didn't add the cheese sauce at all, and we were still charged for it. I ended up complaining since it happened more than a few times in a row, and they still offer to add it as a payable extra on the website. The company apologised and offered a discount. However, some of our friends and family members called me a Karen and an asshole for complaining since it's only a cheese sauce, ignoring the fact that the cheese sauce was paid for. If the company didn't have it and just refunded the difference, I wouldn't have complained, but they proceeded to charge us.   AITA?\n",
      "Hi,   So some context here. My bf (25)M and I (21)F got together in the start of Jan and we have known and been together almost everyday from the end of October last year. I really do like him a lot but I’ve noticed he has irresponsible tendencies and have tried to talk to him about it but he gets easily offended so I try to tell him more subtly until I just end up being a complete bitch. In December, I’ve developed really severe cramping and my period hasn’t stopped for two months. The cramps became so unbearable I had to go to ER where they told me I have IBS (irritable bowl syndrome) and that I’ve been stressing a lot and need to take it easy.  Additionally I also found out I have chlamydia and I’m not sure when I got it because I get tested yearly but just didn’t have time at the end of the year last year. I make sure I always have very safe sex and I tell my partners if I have anything. So, instantly I’m like “oh shit” and i tell him right away and that he needs to get tested. I’m quite panicky because it seems sus as fuck that I got it and it was weirder knowing that I had him get tested in November and he came back clean or so he says. Maybe I had it all along and didn’t know? Or.. It’s currently snowing where we live and weather conditions got extremely bad and I have been persisting that he got get tested and take antibiotics right away because I felt so much better after being treated. He’s very nonchalant and says things such as “who cares” and “life moves on”. By the end of the week I’ve completely finished my antibiotics and I rebook another test and he still hasn’t done it and uses the weather as an excuse. So I do it for him.  He had kept saying the past week how he would do it on Saturday but he actually had all the time before our shit weather conditions to do so but he never did. However, his friend asked us to double date and he was excited and booked our FOOD RESERVATION almost instantaneously. He tells me has anxiety booking apps and uses some sort of analogy like “you know how when you’re in hs and you get anxious retaking tests” to which I ask “at what point are you going to let this keep controlling you? Is your health and well being, and safety like not important?”  Also, I called him out and asked if he even wanted to have sex with me at all because I haven’t seen him for a bit since I work everyday and I wanted to have sex right away. Now I’m questioning if he even likes me and is attracted to me.  In the end he said he didn’t want to fight, called me mean and hung up. It’s been a while and he decided to sleep instead of even trying to communicate with me.   TL; DR : I went to ER for cramps, found out I had IBS and also chlamydia. My bf wouldn’t make an app over the phone or use an online website even to book an app to get tested but booked a food app right away for a double date instead. Which resulted in me calling him irresponsible and him retaliating saying the weather was bad and I’m mean. He’s now avoiding me instead of talking to me.   Additional info : I’m not the perfect gf I will try my very best. I take care of him, clean for him, support him, help support him when he loses his video game tournaments and give him head almost whenever LOL because it’s something I enjoy doing for him. I really wanted to cuddle and have sex when I was done but am I really less worth than chinese food. I’m not gonna say I’m ugly. Humble brag here but i have a really nice body? Or so a lot of people like to tell me and my ass is pretty nice too. I send him lewds as well. And not too much of a reaction. I don’t expect change overnight but he says my attitude stinks whenever I call him out especially on racist jokes because who tf thinks “Chinese people eating cat jokes” are funny??? I sure as hell don’t. He does the bare minimum for me and expects mad praise and if I make a joke about that he gets upset too.\n",
      "I (23f) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (25m) for 9 months now. My bf and I live together but he still spends a night by his parents once a week. He says it's to spend time with his little sister Anika (16). Anyways their relationship is really weird to put it. His sister will call once a day and they'll spend about an hour on facetime talking, her mom might not buy her something then she asks my bf and he'll buy it for her, he'll call her bubs, etc. But I think the weirdest parts are how they act with each other and i'm only seeing it now that I go with my bf whenever he stays over at his parents. Anika steals whatever of his she can get her hands on, & practices makeup on him. My bf will just allowed it and he turns so childish with her, it's embarrassing. They toss insults back and forth and play fight too often. He also has a bad habit of cursing that he seemed to pass onto Anika which is just sad. One time she asked him to grabbed her a kitkat as he was going to the kitchen to get something for himself. He ends up returning with one of those small sand pales filled with kitkats and dumped it over her head and her making it worst by throwing some at him in retaliation.  Well earlier, Anika had posted a bad pic of my bf for her friends to see and when she showed my bf, he threw a pillow at her. The pillow knocked her phone out her hand and fell on her face. My bf just snickered while Anika gave him the middle finger. I followed my bf to the kitchen after that and finally called him out on it. Basically I asked him if he didn't think what he was doing was weird for a grown ass adult. I told him he was childish to still be acting the way he does with his sister and that it was embarrassing to watch him bully someone 9 years younger than him. He got really upset about it and called me an asshole for trying to make him feel bad for his relationship with his little sister. That isn't true and I told him as much and that I just want him to act his age. He's ignoring me now but I don't think what I did was wrong. Aita?\n",
      "So two years ago my friend (I’ll call her Grace) gave me her two American dolls from her childhood. Even as kids she was never huge on them, but I was and still am. She figured they’d get more love at my house than they would sitting in a box in storage at hers. Her mom had no issue with her giving them to me. But now she’s demanding them back so Grace’s future kids can have them. I’m willing to give 1/2 back. I’ve gotten extremely attached to the other one, I don’t want to give it back. Her mother bought these for her over 10 years ago now, and while yes she bought them, they were Grace’s possessions. Grace is an adult now, and was also an adult when she gave them to me. So I think it’s fair to say she knew giving someone something meant you don’t get it back, and that she was able to make that choice. I’m willing to give back the one that was her ‘look alike’ doll, and all the clothes and accessories she gave me. But I don’t want to give up the other one. It was my dream doll as a kid and I was always jealous of Grace for having it. I understand her mom wants the future kids to have these, but they were given to me instead. Grace has even said she doesn’t care, she only wants them returned so her mom will get off her back. I offered to give all but one doll, but she said that won’t be acceptable. WIBTA for standing my ground and refusing to give her mom the doll I’m attached to?  Edited to add: Grace refers to my friend (fake name) not the doll. I just called the doll ‘it’ in this post\n",
      "I haven't spoken to my parents in over a decade. I got pregnant at 18 (I'm 29 now) and they disowned me. Within a month they reached out over facebook, apologising through private messaging, but it was their normal apology, which was a combination of \"we're sorry you felt but that wasn't our intention so maybe you're being oversensitive\" and \"we await your apology to us.\", which is about the way all of their apologies go. I responded with a long message about how hard that month was for me, how scared I was about my situation, and how it made me feel for them to turn their backs on me when all I wanted was for them to tell me it would be okay. Their response was basically telling me that they weren't going to give me sympathy for something that could have been prevented by me keeping my legs closed. They sent other messages after that but I didn't respond and eventually blocked them. They reached out again, also via facebook, after a few years had passed, and I ignored that, too, because it was another of their typical apologies with extra comments about me ignoring them, coupled with a demand (not a request but a demand) to meet my son.  In the last decade all 3 of my siblings have gotten back in touch. My oldest brother tried to force a reunion with my parents so I no longer speak to him, but I'm on good terms with my other 2 siblings. I'm engaged. We've started wedding planning and we have reserved a date next autumn, but we're nowhere near the inviting people stage. My oldest brother is still linked to my other 2 siblings on social media, and one of them shared the engagement announcement (nothing flashy just a post saying \"I'M ENGAGED!!!\"), he saw it, and he told our parents. They've reached out again with the same old \"we're sorry you felt\" apology, plus a request to be invited to the wedding. While them asking if I'll invite them suggest progress (as previously they would have just asked when/where to be, the lack of apology, to me at least, shows they've not changed at all.  I've been debating what to do next. I asked my fiance, who is the captain of team \"we don't need anyone in our lives who makes us feel bad\" (he's also cut off most of his family for his own reasons) but says if I decide to get back in touch he'll support me 100%, while my siblings (aside from the brother I don't speak to) are encouraging me to get back in touch, saying my parents have missed me a lot and want to see me, they'll be on their best behaviour and I can set boundaries and if those boundaries are crossed they'll side with me, it's my wedding so it's pretty important as far as life events go, my son is still their only grandchild, and if anything goes wrong then I can just go back to not speaking to them, especially as the venue we booked has security on hand so in a worst case scenario I can kick them out.  AITA for still not wanting to invite them?\n",
      "I was the new kid last year and I became friends with the other new kid. The thing is that he is an attention seeker and embarrassing. We are 18 and he acts like a little baby. I became friends with anyone last year because I was new but now I've been in the school for the year and made good friends I want out from this one friendship  Yesterday he told everyone in our school that he started to \"jerk off\" - how fucking childish can you be to tell everyone that at the age of 18? Who cares if you do that or not. We are not children or 12. I'm going to just straight up distance myself for him. I don't have time for that in this stressful year\n",
      "Background, my partner has a cousin who has heart problems and is mildly disabled. He just got his own apartment and we helped him move in as well as get house stuff and clean and junk. He lives almost 40 minutes away. Today my SIL and I wanted to pay him a visit and go with him to get some groceries. I used to work for a cleaning company and offered to help clean up his apartment while they go shopping. I wanted to 🍃bake🍃 on the way there so I said \"hey let's use my car\" but since we were in a hurry to get going and I admittedly didn't feel like scrounging around my things to find my main key, I grabbed my backup. Its always worked tho admittedly busted and being held together by a hairtie. But that's why it's the backup, it has to stay open and it's hard to fit in your pocket so I never use it unless I have to but that being said it has never not worked until today. I got and angry call from SIL and cousin saying that my car wasn't starting and the key wasn't working. Now all of my relatives including SIL and my partner are calling me up and blamong me for grabbing the wrong key when I had \"plenty of time to prepare to leave\" I was mid workout when SIL asked if I wanted to go and I wanted to finish before getting dressed and going. I had a solid hour but again I didn't feel like burrowing through my belongings to find my main key. I think it was a simple mistake that is being blown out of proportion. Its called the backup for a reason right? It's not like she's stranded in some dangerous neighborhood dyring a storm or anything she's in front of the grocery store and I called an Uber for them to get back. I think they had other plans that I wasn't informed about and the car not working understandable foiled them but since I was unaware that the key would malfunction I don't think I'm at fault here, it was an honest mistake AITA? TLDR: I grabbed the wrong key, not knowing that It didn't work and ended up accidentally getting my relatives stranded at the supermarket AITA?\n",
      "Not long ago my boyfriend took me to see one of my favorite bands. The band we went to see is alternative so it is expected to have tons of crowd surfers. At the concert my boyfriend and I made our way up towards the front of the stage. During the concert there was a girl who must have been around 275 pounds crowd surfing. Not only did she try once, but twice. The second time she crowd surfed, she fell on my boyfriend and I as well as many people around us. She must have knocked out about 25 people as the venue was very small but very very packed. She ended up falling on my neck; I was very sore but I was okay.  Later on in the night my boyfriend found her sitting with a friend and decided to confront her about what happened and told her that she shouldn’t be crowd surfing and that someone could have been seriously injured.   I was talking about the situation to some friends after the concert and they said he was “fat shaming” the girl and using his masculinity in a toxic way. I, being an overweight female support my boyfriend’s decision, but I wonder if we were actually wrong in this situation. Are we the assholes??  Edit: The whole confrontation went like this:   We had decided to get away from the stage right after it happened and go to the bar where we could find water. He spotted her by the bar and asked her what she was thinking. He told her I’d been hurt and my glasses had fallen. He basically expressed his feelings and she had apologized. She seemed very sorry and introduced herself to us and we left after shaking hands. I would also like to add the band was State Champs, which is more of a boyband that has a very energetic crowd\n",
      "My ex-wife and I buried the hatchet years ago. She invited me to go to her wedding yesterday. I said I would go. However, I ultimately decided to ditch without notifying her. I had diarrhea and don’t want to make an ass of myself. I couldn’t find a good excuse that’s not embarrassing to bail. I don’t like to lie. She called me today and asked me why I ditched. I said it’s probably for the best for her husband since I don’t want him to be worried. She said I need to let her now before I ditch because my presence still means a lot to her and it would have been the ultimate sign to show that we both have moved on for me to watch her kiss her husband and applaud. I told her I ain’t no bitch boy and hung up on her. She sent me some angry texts calling me a wimp still because I can’t move on and face things that are difficult to deal with.\n",
      "So I was talking with my friends today and my one friends sent there siblings artwork, one of the characters names was Ricardo... So naturally I photoshopped Ricardo Milos' face onto that character and sent it to both them and their siblings' dm's. My friend got mad at me because they weren't supposed to send the art to me (Which I didn't know)  I'm really don't know AITA\n",
      "So me (20F) and this guy “Dave” (21M) were together for about a year and broke up a few weeks ago. Very recently before the breakup, I had saved money to buy him an XBOX as he mentioned he wanted one so for a while but didn’t think it was necessary to buy. I saved up for a while and bought one. I play games too and I bought it so we can play on it together, and he really only played it when I was around even though it was technically his. Few weeks later, he broke up with me because he said he just didn’t think we were right for each other, and I was pretty shocked by it but couldn do anything about it.  Last week, I mailed him back the stuff he’s left at my house such as clothes and some other things. I left him a text to ask him to return the XBOX because he wasn’t using it much and I felt rather betrayed since I only bought such a expensive item for him under the impression that the relationship was serious enough and it would last. He replied saying im being ridiculous and I have no rights to take it back.   I’m under the impression that when you break up, you give back whatever stuff they’ve given you and he’s never really given me much things anyway, I helped him pay for stuff sometimes and told him it was fine that he didn’t pay me back for those as they were just small amounts, but we’re both students and I could use the money for it as I’d just sell it. Also the fact that he doesn’t even play on it and broke up with me so soon after I gave it to him made me just think it’s a waste of money, so I texted again with the above reasons and asked for either the item back or the amount I paid for it with some depreciation. He read my text and proceeded to block me. AITA?\n",
      "So first off, I feel the need to start off by saying that I’m a Christian. Now before you jump to conclusions, please just hear me out.  I’m not like the “Christians” who claim to be for God but then go around telling people they’re going to go to hell or judge them for getting abortions, being gay, altering the way they naturally look, etc.  That’s not what being a true Christian is, Christianity is all about peace, love, and acceptance. We do not have the right to judge anyone and people’s decisions are between them and God.   Now, my friend came out to me a few months ago as a lesbian.  She seemed pretty nervous to tell me and when she did, all I said was “Oh, okay.” and I asked her about when she knew, about others who she may have told, of her parents knew.. You know, the usual things you should know so you don’t unknowingly say the wrong things around certain people because I know sexuality is a serious thing. Anyways, the conversation about her sexuality went pretty well overall, I didn’t think anything of it. She told me that she was nervous because she assumed I’d be judgmental about it since I believe being gay is a sin. I told her that while I do believe it’s a sin, it’s also a part of who she is & that to me, it’s no different from someone who is a very short tempered person (since I believe this is also a sin) & these are just traits that make a person who they are. No judgement, of course. By telling her all of this, I thought she’d understand where I was coming from but apparently not because now it is pride month and she intends to partake in it.  She texted me last night asking if I wanted to go with her and some friends to the parade. I politely declined since it would be disrespectful towards my religion; Celebrating sin. She sounded hurt and asked why, I told her my reasoning. She suddenly went off on me in a long paragraph about how she knew she couldn’t trust me, how I’m not accepting, that “all Christians are all assholes who think they’re all God”, and that I lied about how I didn’t judge her for being a lesbian. Of course I was extremely hurt and angry because 1.) I accept that she’s a lesbian & I’m not doing anything to try and change that. 2.) I will  never  go against God and go to an event that celebrates sin. Never. I am not judging the people partaking in it, I actually post on my social media to all my friends and followers who are a part of the LGBTQ+ community to stay safe during pride. And 3.) why do I have to come along when she has other friends who are already planning on attending??  Should I just spend a few moments at the parade?  But I don’t know. Am I the asshole for not supporting her being a lesbian? (Edit: not that I’m against it either. I am just neutral) I’m actually really curious to know if I’m in the wrong at all here because I don’t think I am at all but she’s blocked me on everything and I’m now a bit worried.  Edit: I think I deserve to have a religion that I live by. I think I should be able to live religiously to what I believe is right. Also, I get that this means a lot to her but like I said, she has other friends who are attending with her. There are 7 others in fact. I want her to have a good time, I do. But I think trying to force someone/getting mad at someone/guilt tripping someone to go against their religion is pretty AH behavior. In the past I’ve asked her if she wanted to go to church with me and she said some pretty rude stuff to my beliefs so I just took that as a no and never asked her again. I didn’t try to force her into anything she was against but I feel like that’s what she was trying to do to me with the whole pride parade thing??  Final edit: Take away the fact that I am a Christian and that she’s a lesbian for a second; I respected her choice when she (rudely) decline to participate in an event that celebrates what I stand for. But then when she asked me to participate in an event that celebrates what she stands for (but I disagree with and wanted no part of), she lashed out because she didn’t get her way by me (politely) declining her invite. I was not rude about it. I first told her it was because I simply did not want to attend (which isn’t technically a lie) but when she persisted I tell her why, I told her it’s because I’m not going to go against my religion. A person responded saying it’s like asking a Muslim to attend a barbecue. & this is exactly like that. Even if it is a bbq to celebrate, for example, your friends’ marriage, getting mad at someone for not complying with your wants because of their religion is unacceptable. Because religion isn’t just going to a temple and praying; Religion is a way of life. And getting angry at someone for not changing their way of life (because it doesn’t align with yours or it doesn’t work out in your favor) is, again, unacceptable. So therefore, I realize I am not the AH. Good day folks.   Also, a lot of you need to reread this entire post because your comments either 1.) have nothing to with the topic at hand, and 2.) you jumped to conclusions about her and I’s past friendship.\n",
      "I (28f) went out on a few dates with a guy (27m) in April. Then one day when we were hanging out, he starts flirting with some other girl. I pulled him aside and told him that while we weren't an official couple, I was uncomfortable with him flirting with other girls right in front of me. In the following argument, he revealed that he's poly. I have no problem with polyamorous people, but that's not me. If he had told me that before, I wouldn't have dated him. I put an end to it there and we've barely spoken since, though I've run into him at some social events.  A few days ago, I saw him being really touchy with some other girl. Later I saw her heading for the ladies' room and I followed her. I asked her if he had told her that he's poly, and she said no. Apparently, that was not her type of relationship either, and she ended whatever was going on with them.  Now he's furious with me, saying I had no right to go behind his back, that it's none of my business, and that he was going to tell her when the time was right, and that he learned from his experience with me. I don't believe him, because she clearly had no idea, though I have no idea how long he'd been seeing her. He's claiming that I'm jealous and petty and just trying to get him back. I think she had the right to know. I'm definitely not trying to \"get him back\"- I feel used by him, tbh.  So, am I the asshole?  EDIT: Since someone has somehow concluded from my post that I was stalking this guy when I spoke to the new girl, I'm going to clarify. I was at a bar with my friends. I've been going to this bar for years. I suggested it for one of the dates I went on with that guy. To my knowledge, I'm the one who introduced him to this place. I was already there on the night he came in with this new girl. There was no stalking.\n",
      "I moved out of my parents' house about a month ago. I freely admit that did not leave my room with connected bathroom in the best shape, cleanliness-wise. As I was leaving I told my dad I would pay for a professional to clean it. I can't remember if I told him, but at the time I was thinking around $300. Cut to this morning when he informed me they wanted my unemployed younger brother to do the cleaning and that they expected $500 for it. I explained to him that I had only really budgeted $300.   Then I started googling the cost of a deep-clean or move-out cleaning.  What I found was that the internet thought it should cost me about $75 - $150 for a pro to come clean one room and one bathroom. I passed that info along to my dad and he expressed doubt as to the veracity, so I requested some quotes. The quotes I get back are all in the $150 range. He now says he wants to split the difference and is asking me to pay $400. But I feel like I'm already splitting the difference by offering $300. AITA?  ETA: As I was leaving I told my dad I was prepared to hire a pro to do the cleaning within a week of me being out of there but my dad said he wanted my brother to do it and that we would discuss payment later.\n",
      "So I (28M) had this internal dilemma today as noted in the title.   I study at this coffee shop at least once a week for at least 3+ hours. There’s outdoor- socially distant seating. I choose to wear my mask during my visit. I always see a group of older gentlemen and they seem generally friendly although I’ve never spoken to them.  Today when I arrived at the coffee shop, they had a group of three already there and they had two guitars, an amplifier for the guitars, a cajon (percussion box thing) and some bongos. I’ve never seen them play music here before and it was around 3pm. There wasn’t an open mic night or planned performance or anything of the sort per the shop employees. They were just playing with each other having a swell time.  They’re talented, playing some catchy blues, but I personally found it to be too loud, especially the guitar that was connected to the amp. I was seated at least 20 ft away around a corner, and I could still hear the music over my airpods that were at 75% volume. I was trying to listen to my pre-recorded lectures but had trouble hearing due to the music.  They jammed out for at least 1.5 hours when I was there (I had no idea how long they’ve been there) before they packed up. I decided not to say anything since I’m nonconfrontational and I usually internalize my stress.  WIBTA if I had asked them to stop playing? I think I would’ve been the TA because they got to the shop first, and they’re allowed to play music wherever they choose(?). I also think it’s my fault for not having noise cancelling headphones and choosing to study there. Also my fault for being unable to focus I guess.  But a part of me thinks I wouldn’t be TA because it was an unsolicited performance that seemed over the top for the ambiance. I think the amplifier was overkill and they had no consideration for other guests.\n",
      "I planned a vacation to go on a road trip across the country for the next few weeks. I went on a similar one last summer, and since then a few of my friends have had some interest in doing something similar, along with asking me to bring them along for the next one. Now I’m apart of two groups of friends, and one of my friends from the first group along with myself have been planning said road trip. We invited another friend from our group, along with a mutual friend. Now I didn’t really tell anyone from my other friend group about this trip, mainly because I didn’t know how to bring it up in conversation (I feel weird talking about myself sometimes), I didn’t feel it was necessary at the time, and  I mainly just wanted to be low-key about the whole thing in general, as I don’t really talk about it with anyone other than the people I’m traveling with. But now that the trip draws closer (we leave in a couple days) I feel pretty shitty about not telling everyone I’m friends with what I’m up to. AITA?\n",
      "I have a feeling I know the answer to this one but...  I have a friend who started uni a few years after me. She started a degree in something she's had an interest in for a few years. She had to do a foundation year and re-sat a year in college, hence why she was a few years behind me.  Then suddenly two years into her course she switched to study the same course that I was doing. I thought it was a bit odd because she'd never really shown an interest in that field. Then a year goes by and she is now doing the exact same specialisation I also did. Again I thought it was a bit coincidental since there are lots of routes to pick from.  I went on to do a masters degree in the specific subject area and have recently got an amazing job which I love.  Now my friend told me she has applied for the exact same role I have in my department ( the company is very large and there are many other areas to work in and there are other companies in the area doing similar things).  AITA for hoping she doesn't get the job? I feel I have worked really hard and spent years studying for a role I love, and I want to keep my work and friends separate.   Am I over reacting and being selfish or is this a reasonable reaction ?\n",
      "I(20F) am finding it extremely hard to have emotional connections, which I found out because my mother had a go at me a few days ago. Her and my father split a few years ago, but only in the past year I've started living with her as she didn't have her own place prior. She asked why I don't talk to him more. I told her I just don't really care about him. She asked me to explain I shrugged my shoulders. She ended up forcing me to talk about it, but all I basically said was that I don't think I love him, or care about him, and that if he died I would not care. I said it fairly casually because I thought she already knew about how I felt, but I proceeded to get yelled at, which I dissociated while she did. I scratched my palm so much that it was bleeding. Once she was done she said \"You're broken, I need to fix you.\" This is the one thing I vividly remember because I rolled my eyes as she left.   This sounds harsh but given my life context I think it makes a lot of sense. My father is emotionally distant, he's an alcoholic. He's been a good father, besides when he called me names, a female dog for example, and more. But I just cannot find it within myself to care about most people, let alone him.  Thing is my problem is deeper then just not caring about my father, her talking to me realised that I've become emotionally detached from almost everything. I have a dog and a cat that are mine, and I love very much, but the thing is I've started to get almost annoyed by their presence. We have more animals, but these ones are mine. Lately I've found them more annoying then good, and I've very much decided that when they die I will no longer be having pets of my own, as I cannot look after them.  The only person I care about is my best friend. But I care about them so much to the point I think I'd call it codependency. My whole day depends on talking to them. When can't talk I worry about them dying in many very detailed ways. They don't even have to be outside of their house if they go for more then 10 minutes my brain will start to imagine every way they could die. This actually scares me and gives me panic attacks. I'm constantly worried about them dying because when they do die I'll have no body like them left and probably end up offing myself.  I think my mother is starting to figure out I'm like this with everyone, and is treating me different because of it. My sister's visited and my mother asked if I cared about them and I shrugged. I'd rather not lie, at least about caring about my sisters as how can I care about someone that I don't speak to? She's acting as if I'm a sociopath or something.  Was I the ass for saying that to her? I've been very vocal about not liking my father and siblings since I was 14. Before anyone suggests therapy for myself I've already been when I was 18-19 but for reasons stopped going. It did nothing for me, besides finding out I may be autistic.\n",
      "Okay. I know the title question is a little loaded but, hear me out.  A while ago, me, a friend ( lets call him Zack), and another friend (lets call them Riley) were in a friend group with two other guys. Suddenly, Zack tells the rest of us to stay away from Riley. I oblige and don’t think much of it. A few weeks later and Riley sends a message through the group chat, expressing the fact that we hadn’t talked in a while. I reply with something simple and go on with my day. I get into a voice chat with the guys and Zack asks me why I responded. I told him that I was being polite and he didn’t like that. He told me, again, to stay away from Riley.   Some time passed and Riley messages me, clearly distressed, and says that they don’t know why Zack is ignoring them. I message back and we get to talking and reforming a mutual respect. I eventually have to hide the fact that I’m talking to Riley.   Behind the scenes, Riley had been trying to talk to Zack about what happened, to no avail. Zack is being stubborn and will not tell me why they broke it off.   From what I can gather, Riley did or said something to Zack that made him think they were unstable. They were going through something with their mental health but they’re out of the woods, so to speak.  This all culminated tonight. I forced the three of us into a chat room in hopes to get them to talk and make up. I tried to make them talk to each other but, Zack was being stubborn and didn’t talk. He instead messages me in private and tells me to, basically, fuck off. There was a back and forth about just wanting to know why he ran from that friendship. It ended with him telling me to ream myself and I told him that he is an uptight, passive-aggressive a**hole and blocked him.  I know that some of you will call me out about how I handled the situation with Zack and I’ll admit, I could have been nicer than I was but, I was just so fed up with his BS.  Was I in the wrong?\n",
      "My husband and I have been planning to vacation to Hawaii this June and today he comes home from work and say he purchased the tickets.  Its a red-eye and we are traveling with our soon to be 3 year old. Its 9 hours of travel time with a 3-hour layover ( at 4am) I sat down and started looking for other flights and he got pissed off because I was complaining after \"he spent 6 grand on airline tickets\" and cancelled the trip. We just got home from Florida late last night and it was miserable because our daughter wasn't able to sleep at all (wasn't a red eye just late flight) AITA for not wanting to put her and myself through that? ( he would be across the aisle from us not dealing with her at all)  edited read eye to red eye sorry\n",
      "My MIL moved in \"until she can find a place\" recently.  My husband and I have been on the verge of divorce for almost 3 years. We're trying hard in individual therapy to make it work for our kid, but marriage counseling is shelved because my husband gets too overwhelmed in sessions to make them worthwhile.  We need privacy.   My MIL decided a few years ago she wanted to move down here. His stepdad died and she's alienated herself from my BIL's family, so she was alone. It took her 2 years to overcome her disaster mindset and work up the courage to sell her house. It sold easily within a month.  At first, she was supposed to sell her house and buy one here. Then it was she'd have an apartment ready for her to move into. Then it was she'd stay with us until her already-signed lease started. And then my husband agreed to let her stay with us with no signed lease and no spoken timeframe of when she needs to be in her own place. He insists I said it was okay and I did not.  I tried to get him to set expectations upfront (ex: she needs a signed lease within a month, to help with housekeeping, to contribute to groceries). He refused and was mad I'd question his handling of his mother. ETA: I allowed her into the house with an agreement from my husband that he would make sure she had a signed lease by the end of the first month. The goalposts on that have now moved because he's \"busy and has to do this all for her.\"  She's been here almost three weeks and she's made ONE phone call to apartments which was never returned. At my insistence, she did go look at two complexes yesterday (which were both perfectly fine) but she didn't like either of them for silly reasons.  She silently judges our parenting (and my kid is stressed AF with her here and she's acting out), she leaves messes, and she is teaching our kid bad manners. She burps loudly all the time due to her indigestion and my kid is doing it now. She also uses nasty words that my kid is now repeating.  I'm afraid this whole thing is just a play to move in with us and my husband is going to fall for it OR he wants her here if we divorce. I'm afraid they're trying to push me out, which would be fine if they'd just be  honest  about it. She can buy me out of my half of the equity and I'll take our daughter and get a condo.  I'm ready to tell her (gently) it's not our job to house her and accommodate her for as long as it takes to her to find her own place. This is my house, too. That could be months or years.  I want to be clear that she needs to find her own place and have a signed lease by the end of this month and be in that place by the middle of next month. My husband insists that would be an asshole move because he's \"handling it\" and would actually slow her down because she'll become overwhelmed and stuck in paralysis-of-analysis. I think that's not our problem.   WIBTA to tell my MIL to get a move on and it's not my problem she's \"overwhelmed\"? Both my husband's dad and stepdad died recently and it might be an asshole move because he's sad and she's lonely.   TL;DR MIL moved in with no end date without my permission. She's negatively affecting our household and I want her out ASAP. My husband insists he's handling it and is telling me to back off, even though he's a pushover with her.\n",
      "Quick background:  I do the majority of the shopping for the house. I go during my lunch breaks about 3-4 times a week so myself and my boyfriend can have something to eat for the next couple days. I enjoy the walk there, so I don’t necessarily mind. This has cut down on mine and bf’s Monday night shopping which has been nice.   I come home from my very stressful job (I work with federal Supreme Court matters and it’s mentally and emotionally exhausting) and cook supper and usually do the cleanup, but he helps out sometimes. It’s mostly just me bringing him food while he watches hockey.  Recent stress factor: We just adopted a nine week old puppy, he is adorable but oh my god I forgot how little they sleep and how much they cry if they can’t see you! I have been teleworking since we adopted him and again, am more exhausted than ever.  What happened tonight: Since BF is going away for trade school for eight weeks, we decided to go shopping for me tonight since I’ll be teleworking next week. First thing that got to me was that he grabbed a small basket and not a cart, I told him I didn’t think that would be sufficient as some stuff I want may be heavy - like cauliflower and milk - no sir, the basket will have to do. I tell him I also want some east frozen food as I will be tired and it would be nice to just throw a pre-made meal in the oven.  We grab the vegetables, milk, eggs and a pack of frozen wings for him to have for supper tomorrow (not the main frozen aisle) and then we keep walking to the actual frozen aisle. I just keep walking, aiming for the cauliflower pizza and vegetable lasagna when I hear his voice calling behind me: “What are you going down here for? We don’t need anything down here!” I guess he forgot what I said earlier, like a whole two minutes earlier.  I tell him I want pizza, and yes we do need to go down here - my blood pressure already raising as I remember all the times I went to the store asking him if he wanted anything special. He asks again, saying no we do not actually need anything here. I admit I could have communicated better... but I told him he can head over to the other food aisle if he couldn’t be bothered to accompany me on a grocery trip just for me. He huffed as he didn’t hear me say I wanted pizza, and I just said “Okay let’s just leave then” and started walking toward the cash registers.  He started mumbling under his breath that I could have  just tooold him  I needed to go down that aisle.  Was it really so hard for him to go down that aisle or did I overreact, like he’s saying?\n",
      "So I go to a highschool in the USA and last year we made a rule that all the doors will be locked during class time because people were scared of a shooting or something.  So everyone is used to knocking and someone getting up and answering the door.  Well I guess they decided that rule was dumb and they could just lock the doors if we go into lockdown.  They never really advertised this change.  Well in my first period the door is always unlocked and if we are all doing a test or reading sometimes people will walk up to the door and knock on it without trying the handle at all.  They will knock once and then twice and then just walk away and no one in the class moves not even the teacher.  I know it’s simple to just get up and open the door but it’s annoying because if we are in the middle of a deep thought getting up can interrupt it.  I’d be pissed if I knocked twice and no one answered but like how easy is it to just try to fucking open it.\n",
      "Previous Post  After my last post, MIL called me and asked if we could sit down over coffee and talk about what’s been going on.  I said how awful it is hearing her belittle me and Husband for not having kids, especially when it isn’t possible and that our decision won’t change. I explained that her attacking my marriage was uncalled for. Especially in my own home to my face.   She gave a non-apology by apologizing for how I felt and said she would make the effort to not say rude things about my marriage or stance on children, so that we could have a relationship with her. She followed this apology up with “You need to understand that I just want what’s best for my son.”  A few days later, Pregnant SIL called and told me that MIL called one SIL, saying if my husband didn’t marry me, she’s have a grandchild from him and she still didn’t agree with us not having kids.  I was hoping she’d be able to change but she didn’t last two weeks. I was angry but I sat with it and read over what some of you said. This is a losing battle with her, there’s no forcing her to like me or finding that solid footing. Plus, some of you mentioned that this isn’t my battle to fight with MIL. That’s on my husband. And you’re right. They’re not my parents, they’re his.   I talked to Husband about it and he talked to his parents and had a firm conversation with them. I wasn’t there for it, but FIL showed up the next morning to see us.  He apologized for his behavior on Father’s Day and his part in it. He went on to say that MIL feels strongly that her son should be having children, that everyone should have children, but that it’s not any of her business what we do nor is it his. It was a genuine apology. He said she made me feel unwanted in a family where I was very much wanted. We cried a lot during our talk.   As for my MIL, she has not reached out to me at all, and I don’t expect her to. Husband and I decided we will be No Contact with her. We will talk to FIL, have him over sometimes, but we won’t be speaking to MIL. We’re going NC with her, including not going to gatherings that she’s attending and excluding her from those that we host.  I felt awful even having this convo with Husband about NC, not wanting to alienate him from his parents, but he brought it up first which shocked me. A few of you suggested that it was because he was so used to the treatment and he agrees. It’s been second nature to him for so long that he just brushed it off. He sees this now and he’s firmly on my side which I’m grateful for.  As for the sisters, one of them is still firmly on MIL’s side but the rest of them, on varying levels understand why we’re going NC.  I think having a third party here give some insight helped me see that this isn’t a situation where I need to just roll with the punches. And I appreciate those of you who helped us on this!\n",
      "I have a friend group it 6. We are pretty much all relatively busy in workloads, me a little less than others.  We have an upcoming school event (a dance) today, and my friend decided a few weeks ago we weren’t going to go but will still have a hangout.  Around 5 days ago I started asking my friends what we were going to do, and a slowly got answers—yet the plans were not solidified until today.  Of the 6, one was not able to go, and 3 of us were set on a place. We finally were good. We kinda had to say a place and everyone was agreeing on it as me and another friend had enough of no one really responding to the event.  My “busiest” friend, we’ll call N, has not responded barely at all to our event, but had been invited to another party and she was only talking about this. The thing is, she said it was only a 30 minute thing and she would see us afterwards.  By the way, I want to say N isn’t “too” busy because she literally went to the mall for hours with one of friends yesterday and posted a few days ago of her hanging out with her other friends.  Fast forward today, 3 hours to the event, N says she does not want to go to the place we agreed on and also wasn’t going to the party. We were obviously slightly ticked off, and I have had enough.  I told her how she has been silent for the last 5 days, and a friend asked why it mad and I told her that she has said absolutely nothing for the last week but now, 3 hours from the event, she says she doesn’t like our plans.  Knowing my friend she will be pissed when she reads what I said, but I had enough that she could spend hours hanging out with her friends and our friends after school, but couldn’t even spend 5-10 minutes at most to say anything about our plans.  So AITA for my reaction?  Edit: A quick note that the event was going to be outside (going to the town center) but now where we are the area is a little wet, that might be the reason she did not want to go, but the rain is over now and even still we would be inside so it isn’t that bad.\n",
      "I feel bad for getting annoyed by this, but one of our friends constantly invites our server to voice chat with him, but then doesn't actually talk to  us . He usually plays apex when chatting and only talks to his teammates, but won't really respond to us in the voice chat he invited use. A lot of times im the only one available to vc with him, so ill be there trying to talk, and he just either ignores it or gives short responses and stops the convo. I don't want to say anything because it might be mean, but it just seems pointless. And if nobody joins he will message us again. When we do join he talks to us like once every 10 minutes. And when i ask for other people to join because i want someone to talk to and hang with, he always joins, but he doesn't talk to me or anyone else, he usually talks to himself or to teammates on a separate game. And he never wants to join anyone else in their game, he plays his own games and just stays there not engaging with us. And i wanna talk to him because he is my friend, but he doesn't continue convos i start or start convos himself. When he does rarely start convos there is nothing to build off of because he doesn't ask actual questions or comments, it usually just random humor. Sometimes ill tell everyone in the server ive been having a bad day and i want a friend to either comfort or distract me, and he will join, but again, he will just ignore me and chat with teammates. Am i getting annoyed over nothing?\n",
      "Background: ever since the beginning of time my paternal grandma and my mom never had the best relationship to the point that my mom would never go to my grandmas place until one day my grandpa died. My grandma basically cannot handle all the papers on her own so my parents had to handle all the papers whilst I stayed at my grandmas place for a month. Before the day of the funeral my grandmom hard accused my mom of stealing for no reason and of course my mom lashed out on her all of her days off not only that but she even had to absent on 2 days just to finish the papers relating to my grandpas death not only that she made sure that there was always fresh flowers on the wake. Not I'm put into a dillemma in which I follow my mom or my grandma and I chose my mom and left that place. I'm more of saddened that my dad was caught in between this as he doesn't know which side to pick so she stayed with her mom. Take note: after my aunt and uncle leave and go abroad(they returned home just to comfort my grandmom) she'll be all alone. Im stuck in a dillemma now pls help\n",
      "Ok, so I was in rehab a few months ago and in my free time, I wrote letters to my family members while I was in there. My sister's was all positive, I told her how sorry I was and how much I loved her. My Mom's was positive too, I told her that I was sorry and that I understood the choices she made and didn't begrudge her any of her missteps; she's only human and none of this was really her fault. Parents fuck up; that's life. My brother's was not really positive but the anger was directed at myself and not him,  I told him to get away from me if I relapse again because I know that I drain him of his money and mental health and drag him right down into that hole with me if he gets too close, and I don't want that to happen.   But then I got to my dad and I just couldn't feel anything but anger. I'm working on that. But just some back story; my dad is an alcoholic and my mother has been enabling him for years.  Before I went into rehab; he brought up the fact that he drinks every day and is just fine and couldn't understand why I went to hard drugs (meth) and couldn't just keep it together. I told him that I could've \"held it together\" if I had a wife that held it together for me like he does.  But anyway, in my letter to him I just let him have it. I talked about how addiction is a family disease and that I learned my unhealthy coping mechanisms from him and my uncle,  talked about the fact that he belittles the rest of us because he feels inadequate because we're all smarter than him. And on and on and on. Almost every resentment I had been harboring for 25 years.   When it was all said and done. He burned the letter and then told the rest of my family that I blamed him for everything. Which I didn't say that, but if I'm honest, I do see how he couldn've gotten that impression. Told me that I was never allowed to move back into his house again and that if my mother allowed it he'd leave. When he needs to tell me something; he has my siblings do it.   The rest of my family has just put their hands up in exasperation at the whole thing. Trying not to side with anyone. My Mom even told me that she wished I could have spread the resentment out more evenly and not gone in so hard on my dad while being so nice to her; reminding me that she co-signed a lot of his bullshit. And this made me even angrier; because before this my mom loved her letter and I know that the second he got his, he immediately burned it and then set out to ruin hers for her. Because he can only feel ok, if everyone else feels shitty. And that's why his was the way it was in the first place.  That being said. He still came and got me from rehab. Has bailed me out several times at this point. And I know that part of the reason he's such a dick is that he suffers from literally the same disease that made me such a dick.  EDIT: When I say \"bailed me out\", I meant figuratively. As in helped me out when I was in a jam. Not bailed me out of jail. I've never been to jail.\n",
      "So lately, things between me and a friend have been rocky. To put it bluntly I'm starting to doubt all the things he has supposedly gone through. We met online on a platform site and it's our only means of communication. I've never seen his face, we know each other on a surname basis, and we are both minors. It's hard for me now to believe all the things he told me, everything just seems a little too unrealistic.  Around a year ago he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, I was told it was pretty bad so we both prepared for the worst. He had told me that he went to the doctors a few times, but he never mentioned anything about treatment. At the time I believed pretty much all of it, stayed up late almost every night to see him and just chat. After a while he was supposedly better.  Which goes into another thing, I won't leak any specifics, but he told me he had a bad childhood. Everything from family, addiction and gangs, he told me he had trouble with. Again, I ate it up when he first told me. Part of me believes maybe he did have a poor childhood, just not in the way he says.  Fast-forward to about 8 months later and we start talking again. During the time we weren't speaking to each other he claimed that an immediate family member passed. That's when I started to get sceptical. I still talked to him though. A little after that he told me that the illness he had prior had relapsed, I've heard of this stuff before but I feel like it is far too soon. Still, stuck with him. Then, a few weeks ago, he had told me his twin died. Didn't tell me when, or how.   That's pretty much all of it, to me, it seems like he's lying to me for attention or pity. I've had a bad encounters with attention seeking like this before, so this may just be me trying to play cautious. On one side, this all seems fake to me like he ripped it from a soap opera. On the other, I've lived an uneventful life, so I'm probably ignorant. From my point of view he seems to have some sort of tragic hero complex, he's a good guy at heart but pushes way too much onto himself.  Sorry if this post is too long, new to Reddit.\n",
      "Me (30m) and my gf (27f) have been together for a little under a year. She’s never been a great cook, veggies aren’t cut small enough, everything is always under cooked, she doesn’t have patience with cooking, she throws all the ingredients in from the start instead of adding things according to their time it takes to cook, and she doesn’t use the correct spices if she uses any at all. I’m not the only one who notices, when I first met her roommate one of the first things she asked is “what do you think of her cooking?” And we have discussed her cooking in the past that she needs to be more patient with things. Aside from that I notice my criticisms hurt her feelings so I often lie saying I enjoy her meals, and offer to help her so I can enjoy them too.   Well last night it came to a head, as I’m driving home she texts me saying to let her know when I’m on the way so she can start dinner, I say to wait for me so I can help. Well I get home and she didn’t wait, she has raw hashbrowns and cheese in the pan, no spices also, anyone who cooks knows potatoes take a while and cheese should be added at the end, I point this out and she is immediately hurt, saying I don’t appreciate the effort she put into cooking. Then eventually I say I usually don’t enjoy her cooking which is why I offer to help, so she is upset that I lied to her saying I’ve enjoyed her cooking in the past.   Eventually things cooled down. I apologized for lying and not expressing my appreciation, but I stood firm in saying I think she could improve her cooking with a few tips. She’s not having this and says I can cook for myself from now on. I know this is a dumb thing to fight over, I want to spend the rest of my life with this girl, I would continue to tell her I enjoy it and just eat the stuff but if I’m going to be eating her meals all the time I think I should have some input. Am I the asshole here? How do I go about addressing this? I feel like not having her cook because I don’t like it isn’t a good solution for our relationship.  UPDATE: So I didn’t make it clear before, but I know how to cook well and offer to cook 100% of the time that’s no problem for me. But we talked about it and we agreed that I will do a better job being appreciative of her efforts, and she will start to do a better job at receiving my critiques. All is good in the world again.\n",
      "I have an old car that I bought for 2000 dollars when I was 16. I'm 26 now. In the time I've had it, I've learned a lot about car maintenance, I fix it up with junkyard parts and it's pretty cheap to keep running. It's dented and rusty as all hell but it goes and it's cheap.  So anyway, my neighbor parks in his driveway and I park on the street. And he's gotten mad at me for parking in the street because he finds it harder to navigate his big truck around my car. I asked him if he wants me to move my car ahead a bit or behind a bit on the street, because I'm happy to, but I have to park somewhere on the street because I don't have a driveway or garage space.   He didn't like that, he doesn't want me parking on the street at all. But I'm not about to park on a whole different street then I live at.  Anyway, this week I was sitting on my fire escape reading a book and I saw my neighbor drive out his driveway right into my car's side. I grabbed my phone and started filming asap.  I walked out to the car still filming and got a good video of the damage to the door panel. It was dented and scratched.  Now my car was already pretty beat; it's got body panels from 3 different cars, dents and dings all over, it's got damage to the convertible soft top that I've fixed up with glue and patches, etc. It's a tough old girl.  So the new damage didn't bother me much, I didn't plan on fixing it. But it did bother me that my neighbor hit and run my car. Especially because he knew it belonged to me.  So after a few days of thinking on it, I decided to file an insurance claim. I sent the company the video which had gotten my neighbors license plate in it. I thought they could find his insurance and settle.  The insurance company said that for a hit and run the policy was that I needed to file a police report so I did.   I wasn't expecting that much but I got a $1600 dollar payout from my neighbors insurance. I guess they appraised my car based on its estimated value based on model and year and didn't pay attention to the fact that it's an absolute beater with a lot of diy fixes.   Anyway my neighbor is mad at me and came to my house after three insurance thing had paid out and he was looking to yell at me. But my landlord was there in the hallway doing some repairs and when he came looking for which door was mine, my landlord told him that if he wasn't invited to get the hell off his property. Guess he could tell this guy was angry and probably wasn't a good idea to send him up to my room.  I feel a little bad that I hid lol. Feels cowardly. But it was also cowardly he did a hit and run  AITA for taking a huge insurance payout on my beater car, because my neighbor hit it?\n",
      "I was out on a hiking trip a few days ago - I struggle with depression, and nature helps immensely to clear my head -- when a text message from my mom came through: \"Remind me your middle name? Melody, right?\" The phone signal was bad, so I waited to get back to camp to reply to her. In the meantime, stomping around in the quiet woods, my mind was filling with feelings twisting around the question, \"What does it mean for the very person who gave you your name --- to forget that name?\"  My mom does not have dementia. This is the first time she has asked me that question.  Yes, my middle name is Melody. She could have easily checked my birth certificate, that she has stored in her safe, but she chose to ask me out of the blue in the middle of my trip in the Middle of Nowhere. Honestly, I felt a little sad at the thought, a mother forgetting the name she gave her daughter. I was also concerned if, at 65, she was starting to have memory loss. When I got back into signal later in the day, I asked her, \"Did you remember my name?\" No reply. After an hour, I wrote back, giving my full name, my birthdate, as well as my brother's full name, my dad's full name, and, why not, her full name. I also threw in my place of birth and \"My social security number is .... kidding! :P\"  No reply from her, only crickets. The next day, she writes me: \"Have a safe drive.\" She clearly does not want to talk about it. My mom is the type of person who never apologizes for her actions. She can do no wrong, because, in her toxic positivity mind, as long as her intentions are \"good\", she is not responsible for other people's feelings. Her apologies come in the form of \"I am sorry you feel that way\" and \"Happiness is a choice\".  By now, I know better than to tell her something she did made me sad. I am trying not to take it personally, trying to have compassion for her, imagining the shame and self-judgement she might feel about her ability to confidently remember.  Would I Be The Asshole (WIBTA) if I brought this \"Name forgetting\" incident up, a few days later, out of concern for memory loss/aging/dementia? Or should I just let this go?  Update: Grateful to everyone for your input, it helped me get a better perspective. Brains are funny things, latching on to specific things that you are running away from while completely letting go of others that you are grasping for. :)  Yes, we all forget things. When we hang out, my mom and I often playfully try to figure out \"words that escape her\", sometimes for hours. It's zero pressure, zero shame, usually a delighted \"AHA! THERE it is!\" My dad, who lives with her, has shared with me concerns in the past about her \"memory problems\" (that I have not observed, personally). My grandma had severe dementia (which my mom told me \"was her choice\" - whatever that means.)  I guess it just hit me hard that, in the future, my mom's memory blips could, and would, include me.   Thanks for all your humbling and hilarious anecdotes.\n",
      "Throwaway account. WIBTA if I stole a lady's dog?   I know, it sounds bad. Let me explain.  At my job, every few days, this little dog gets away from his house and comes across a very busy street to our building. We'll call the dog Rover.   Rover is a young, little 7 pound terrier mix that is as cute as can be. He has no chip (owner told us). He sometimes has his tags on, sometimes he does not. He has a chunk of hair missing above his tail that he bites at, and he has a lot of fleas. Rover is very friendly though and he really likes me. He's a good boy. I put him in the office with me and he runs around happy. I give him some water and we play fetch until the owner comes to pick him up.  The owner is this woman that lives across the street about a 1-minute walking distance away. Rover has gotten out so many times and came over here that the office lady has her number written down and calls her. She always says she'll \"be right over\". She comes in always about 30-45 minutes later, with 4 small and unruly children every time. She has never once thanked us for keeping Rover safe.  Rover has come over to our building and this entire scenario has played out 20+ times.   A couple of weeks ago, someone in our building noticed an animal control truck was outside, and saw Rover. The person knows I like this dog and they called me. I was able to talk to the animal control guy and let him know that I knew who the owner was. He said he was called because there was a \"loose dog running around\". He reluctantly let me have Rover and said that he was otherwise headed to the pound (that kills dogs) downtown.  Rover had no tags this time. We called the woman. She came in to get him 30 minutes later with her children running around. The office lady told Rover's owner that a person here would be willing to keep Rover if she didn't want the dog since it looks like he's being neglected. She also told her that we essentially saved Rover from going to the pound, and with no tags, no chip, and no information, she likely would have never seen him again. The woman called our office lady a bitch and left.   Rover got out AGAIN today. We called her. She came and took Rover.   I love dogs. I really do not want to see Rover get hit and killed by one of the many, many cars that come on the busy street. There is even a Corvette shop around the corner that regularly \"tests\" (illegally) out their cars on this busy street and flies by at 60+ mph. The office lady told me that the next time he gets out and comes over here, we should just not call the woman and I should just keep Rover.  I would essentially be stealing a dog, but I would be giving him a much better home. I'm not sure of the legality of this. I told a few friends what is going on, and a few said they have my support. Another told me I would be a thief and a major POS.   So, Reddit, WIBTA if I stole this lady's dog?   Thank you.  Edit: Video of Rover  Edit2: It's 1:30 PM Eastern. Rover did not come to our building today.\n",
      "18f) reside with my dad (70M) and my little brother (13M), my mother passed away four years ago making me the only female in my household so alot of caretaking of the house is done by me, my brother has issues with helping around the house and taking care of himself, he doesn't clean up after himself, he does not do any of his chores and when he does do them he does it completely half-assed and leaves it worse than what it originally looked like. He'll come home from school, and lounge around in his uniform all day and video gaming, then proceeds to say that he's tired and can't do any of his chores. This has left him a complete mess and any attempt to talk to him about his behavior results in him throwing tantrums and screaming about how we don't care about him. This morning it got completely out of hand when, after a 5 day long weekend, he refused to go to school Tuesday morning, we dragged him out of bed to the bathroom only for him to stand idle in protest while screaming that he's tired as he was playing video games last night. After hearing that in frustration, I took the conse and hid it in my dad's room and told him that until he takes care of himself he cant use it, now he's giving the silent treatment and my dad keeps telling me to give it back as it was unecessary. So AITA?\n",
      "i'm going straight to the point.  four family members on my mom's side died because of cancer: my mom herself, her dad, her brother and her brother's son. my sister also had cancer 2-3 years ago, but she survived.  i've been with my boyfriend, J, for almost six years now. he was aware of all of my family members' passing, although he didn't really know the cause of death cause i thought it unnecessary.  this is a topic my family hates talking about and i myself don't know about it much since they shut the conversation down every time without fail. my mom died when i was barely nine years old and all of the other members died way before i was even born or shortly after. it is also a topic i don't like telling people in general cause they always react like i'm a wounded puppy (which i understand it is to show empathy and compassion but it is as if i'm very pitiful) and they also always have a million questions about it (\"what type of cancer?\", \"did it take long for them to die?\", \"how was it, going through that?\", etc).  a long, long time ago, me and my two sisters decided we were not to have children, so as to preserve our hypothetical kids of having hypothetical cancer and because all of us weren't the biggest fans of kids anyway.  it was all going according to plan until i got pregnant in my early 30s. it wasn't planned, me and J were always careful so it took us by surprise. J was happy about it, and although he was indifferent about us having kids, he saw this \"accidental pregnancy as a blessing\". to \"celebrate\", we decided to throw a small party, family members only (we all live in the same yard and are quarantined together) and it was all going okay until my aunt decided to make a toast and jokingly said: \"to the cursed child!\". this doesn't sound as bad or as heavy in my language (i'm not from an english speaking country) and everybody laughed, but my boyfriend was visibly confused so he took me aside and asked me about it. straightforwardly and in a rush so i could go back to the party, i told him four family members died because of cancer and my sister also had it in the past, but she survived.  he reacted poorly. he said i was deceitful, i should've told him long ago, i was in the wrong for not telling him any of this, etc. he raised his voice a bit so it attracted my family's attention and they intervened by basically trying to shut the topic down, like they do each time. J went upstairs, locked himself in his office and still hasn't gotten out (it's been more than ten hours since then). everyone but my sisters left shortly after J went upstairs. my sisters sat me down and said i should've talked to him about it but i told them i thought i didn't have to, we were NOT planning on having kids EVER. also what can i do about it now? it's literally out of my control. plus, it's not like it's a guarantee my kid's gonna have cancer, it is a possibility.  two of my cousins have texted me saying the same: i should've told him before, i am in the wrong. so i'm starting to think i'm TA here. am i?\n",
      "Not in the US. Some countries work different.  Context: My(24f) brother(28m) owns a 4 bedroom apartment. He rents out the rooms and as I have more free time and flexible schedule I took over the ground work (visits, contacts, etc) to find tenants and he okays it according to my opinion and his financial assessment.  Some relevant rental conditions. We:   Take a 250€ deposit to returned after we get the keys and check for damages. It is NOT the last months rent.  Ask for 1 month notice to move out, but will take 2 weeks min. although the written rule in 1 month min.  Always clean the room and linens before someone moves in, even so we do warn that the room should be left in good condition and relatively clean, but like to do our own cleaning as some people have lower cleaning standards than others.   We rented a room to \"Dana\" (30's, divorced, 2 kids living w/ her ex) in march 2021.  When she moved in she was told that when she leaves she needs to leave the room in the same way she found it, aside from normal wear.  Last Saturday she called me saying her ex had moved away and she'd already found a new room and wanted to move out at the end of the month (2 days later). I told her that per our agreement when she moved in I could keep the deposit due to the lack of notice but offered that she could stay and pay for March and if I found someone to move in she'd get the deposit and the rest of the rent back. She said okay. Monday I messaged her asking IF I found someone when would she be able to leave, so I could organize the cleaning and give the person coming in a date to move in. She says she's moving out the next day, but keeps the key as she still had some stuff there. I'm thinking I'll just bite the bullet and let her move out anyway and if all well I'll give her the deposit back, cause she's struggling. Wednesday I go do the room check. It's bad. The floor's disgusting, the walls are stained, the bed linens (included in the rental) are so stained they had to be thrown away, there are nail polish stains on the floor and desk and some unknown very sticky residue on the closet drawers. I barely managed to get the room semi-presentable (i.e. clean the floor a move the furniture around to hide most of the stains) before I had to show it, but it still needs a paint job.  Today, she came to get the rest of her stuff, gave the keys back and asked for her deposit. I told her she had to talk to my brother as he's the financial guy, but we'd have to deduce the damage to the walls and stain cleaning, since she hadn't fixed anything. She says I'd told her I'd give her her deposit back (which I did if the room was in good condition), that I'd said I'd clean it (which I'd take if it was just overly dirty), I should have told her there where damages so she could fix them (the damage was pretty obvious) and she only left because I said she had to move out as I had someone for the room. Now the only message I sent was the one above which definitely didn't tell her to leave and although we do clean-up it doesn't include ruined linens and stained walls and floors. She also says that if she'd known she'd stay the rest of the month, but I informed her that she hadn't paid this months rent, to which she says that that's what the deposits for. I remind her that the deposit is not considered as rent but as a guarantee for any damages and all rents must be paid and the deposit is always returned upon exit and a room in good condition. She calls someone and says I won't give her the deposit back. A bit later guy shows up and starts screaming at me that I'm trying to steal her money, I'm scum, blah blah. Honestly he's far from the scariest dude I've had to deal with so I hold my ground, try to ignore him and keep trying to calmly clarify the issues and offer that she can fix the issues on an agreed day and get the deposit back without the linens unless she replaced those too. But since she had no plans on paying anymore rent I'd be keeping the keys. All the while the guys calling me a fraud, liar and whatnot and at some point I say sternly \"Why are you yelling? We're just talking\" and he bubbles a little and then leaves with her in toe mid conversation, saying it's not woth it and just cursing at me.  She texts that without the deposit she can't afford the new room, near her kids. I offered again to find a day for her to tidy up and resolve the issues in the room so I could give her back more money. She just replied to send her what was left from the deposit after the damages were covered, which was confusing for someone who had just said she had no money.  The deposit wouldn't even cover all the expenses, let alone the month we're owed do to the no notice, but I'm thrifty and have some skill overlay from my actual job and if I \"DIY\" everything I can save around 100€.  My brother says screw it, keep the deposit as we're entitled to it anyway.   My mom has suggested I could give her some of the money, because we do feel sorry for her situation and I'd be the bigger person.  I feel a bit guilty it will probably cost her being closer to her kids but also like I gave her every out I could and it would also be at my expense. So WIBTA?  Edits: 1.Due to the character limit some things weren't as clear as they should be so clarification on some things 2.Though I'd add the reason I can save the 100€ is because I'm not charging for my work. I work in restoration usually furniture, but am qualified for wooden floor repairs. I'm just charging for materials. If I asked someone to do just the paint job it would be most of the deposit if not all of it. 3. We also do have the condition that if you leave without giving us enough notice (2 weeks min) we can keep the deposit. So technically i wouldn't even need to give her the money. I'm just torn between not charging my work and giving it to her anyway so she stays near her kids and keeping it for the work and the no notice clause.\n",
      "So, a couple of years ago, I happened to come across a high street clothing shop in London that sold good quality cargo pants, jackets etc. They were not cheap but the material and stitching was very good and they felt great on me so I bought quite a few items. Cargo pants, a jacket, a few t shirts etc.  Been wearing them for a couple of years now and last night, a friend of mine looked at the brand and said \"Oh, Thor Steinar! You know that brand is banned in some German cities and other parts of Europe because of facist links?\" Needless to say, I was shocked and confused and asked more. My friend works regularly in Germany and its information he's just picked up along the way.  I did a Google search on the brand and the Wiki page https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Steinar and sure enough, there has been quite a bit of controversy about it but it seems like a lot of it has been media hyped. Nothing that we'd heard of in the UK as far as I know but obviously those aren't the circles I mix with.  So I was left with a dilemma. I'm not a Neo Nazi, i abhor the whole ideology and do not want to be labelled as such nor do I want to wave the flag of a brand that may or may not have links to facists but at the same time feel that it's an unknown controversy here, they're good clothes and I like wearing them.   Now that I am aware of the controversy, I could throw them away as a protest of principle or I could continue to wear them. I asked my wife her thoughts on it and she said that now that I know, I'd be complicit and should do the right thing but my feelings are that they are just clothes, I like them and I'm not a facist so what's the harm.  Based on how the comments are in this thread, I will change my opinion and do what the majority feel is best.\n",
      "One of my best friends who I’ve known for 2 years now and is in a friend group with a lot of my friends started being a douche at the start of the new school year for some unknown reason, I don’t know if somethings going on or what. It started a couple of days ago when he kept preventing me from completing missions in GTAV by killing me over and over and preventing me from playing with the rest of my friends. No matter what I say he disregards it. A couple days later with him doing that every day I told him when I was playing GTAV with him and 2 other friends that I’m going to try to get into AP English and he decided to say, “Your not cut out for that”, even though my grades are usually really good and my teacher thinks I can do it. He then started to make fun of me after me saying it’s not funny for him to make fun of me for trying to go outside my comfort zone and become a better student. And of course he decides put downs and generally just not allowing me to have fun with my other friends is funny and I’m being a baby. I am tired of his shit and go from being diplomatic to telling him he’s being an asshole, but he thinks since it was all “just a joke” that I’m the one in the wrong being a dick for not letting him trample over me, and he continues it until I told him he was “a fat fuck who’s inflated ego prevents him from maintaining friendships” and since how I thought it was funny it was a joke too. Of course I don’t really believe that but I was just done with his shit, he proceeded to ban me off of his discord which is how I communicate to my friends even though we all go to the same school.   TLDR: Friend makes me feel like shit and tells me I’m stupid for multiple days strait and it was just a joke since he was laughing, I made a joke about him being a fat fuck and now he’s pissed at me, even though I told him to stop.  I still regard him as a best friend and it’s really uncharacteristic for him to be like this. And yes I realize I let him get to me but I wouldn’t have if he hadn’t been one of my best friends.\n",
      "So I 13m cut fire wood every day for like 6 hours for the past 5 months and the past two times my older sister 29f comes over to my house for fires she is very contorting about taking my fire wood I cut throwing it on with asking me first and getting a stick a pushing the fire around  and starting back up when I was about to roast my masmelow. and last night she took it to a personae level by saying what do you know a a about fires boyscout drop out bc I droped out in webleos 1 bc I had not friends and I was being bullied. And she knew that bc I thought she knew how it felt to be bullied. She always told me not to bulied kids because she was bulied in the school. the awaited qustion am I the ass hole for not wanting my sister to come over for fires anymore  EDIT thank you guys for you’re feed back I will try to find a different way to. Resolve the problem and sorry about grammar and spelling I’m dlxlexic\n",
      "I have been neighbours of a couple with a small child for 3 years. Over the three years, these two have had some really explosive fights and I can often easily hear the woman screaming through the wall. At first, I was really sympathetic because I couldn't imagine being in a relationship like that. The husband moved out for a month even since I've moved in and came back (my not super informed guess is they can't afford to get divorced because the husband has told us about their money troubles).   For a while, I could deal with it but I have since started working at home much more and for some reason the fighting has gotten much worse, to the point where I have heard them fight all day several days in a row. The shared wall between our townhouse is like paper and it is really stressing me out while I am trying to work. I have tried moving rooms but the house isn't very big and they also move around while their fighting.   I want to ask them if they can stop but how can I do that? Also I think it would probably be really embarrassing to the woman (who is otherwise very nice) that I've been overhearing her scream at her husband for three years. I'm also not very close to her so I can't really talk to her about it under the guise of friendship. WIBTA?\n",
      "My Fiancee and I are getting married in November and after delays due last year, are finally getting to the nitty gritty details of planning. Within the last year my older brother \"Pete\" has gotten married to a woman with 2 kids, 6F and 8M. I met them a couple times, Im not exactly a kid person but they seem pretty normal so thats good I guess.  &#x200B;  This sunday my family had brunch at my parents house and Pete came with his wife and stepkids. He was asking me about my wedding and how planning was going and then asked if we had plans for the Flower Girl and Ring Bearer. I told him that we weren't having a flower girl but we've been training our German shepard mix Bubba to calmly walk down an \"aisle\" we set up to have him play a fake ring bearer role (Actual rings will be kept by Best man to be safe but guests wont realize that). Bubba is a service dog dropout so while he wasnt up to par for those standards he's still better trained than 90% of dogs.  Pete asked if his stepson could walk the dog down the aisle and stepdaughter be the flower girl. I told him I hadnt thought about that but we'll see. Well yesterday he calls me and asked if Ive given it any thought and I told him I actually just want to stick to my original plan. My Fiancee and I have been excited for our plan and to be totally honest, we just dont really want kids to have a part in our wedding. We're not going totally kid free since a couple of our friends who need to travel will be there and we realized it wasnt realistic to expect them to come without their kids, so they will be guests but not in the wedding.  &#x200B;  Pete got really mad at me, accused me of not accepting his new family into the larger family. Apparently his wife doesnt feel accepted by my parents and now us, I guess my sister made a comment about her infant son being the \"only grandchild\" so far and that really rubbed them the wrong way... Im staying out of that whole thing.  Pete texted me again this morning and honestly Im just getting annoyed at him and told him basically if he wanted to showcase his new family he shouldve waited to have a traditional wedding, not tried to force them into mine. I feel like that might have been to harsh now and Im feeling a little guilty...  Edits:  Forgot to mention Pete had a small courthouse wedding in the last year, so no large wedding.  My Sister's comment was offhand and not meant to be a dig at my brother's wife or her kids. When she realized how it was perceived she apologized, but everyone knew what she meant. Nobody has been mean to the kids.  &#x200B;  Im done replying to comments now. Thank you to most of you who were reasonable even if we didnt agree.  But I want to say that everyone who has suggested an alternative role for them is totally ignoring the fact that I said my fiancée and I don't want kids to play a role in our wedding. We would have preferred a completely childfree wedding. We are already compromising by letting them attend as guests.\n",
      "I have a strange relationship with my parents. On one hand, my therapists have described their actions as neglectful and abusive, and they're right. On the other hand we communicate often and they support me in ways many better parents do not do to their own children. Details aren't important but that context is.  I'll be graduating university next year, and graduating from one of my majors next term. It has been made very clear to me, multiple times, that my parents will not be proud of or happy with me when I graduate, and that graduating a four year university is just an expectation, not a special achievement. I'm not paraphrasing, those were the exact words.  My mom has begun to mention inviting certain family members to my graduation. Next term I'll also be completing a large presentation for one of my majors that many students have friends and family attend. I don't want them there at all. I never wanted to walk at graduation anyway, but after hearing multiple times that it's not am achievement to be particularly proud of, I'm pretty adamant that they aren't invited to any event related to my academic achievements. I don't want to go, they talk like it's no big deal. The issue is that I know telling them this would cause a huge fight, and my mother at least claims she wants to come. The other complicating factor is that I've spent 6 years in university and transferred three times, something that was necessary but regardless wouldn't have been possible without their financial support. I'm worried I might be the asshole because I wouldn't be in this position anyway if they hadn't backed me financially, and I don't want to look like I'm taking their money and leaving, and bringing this up could cause a major, major fight. But on the other hand, they both have been truly awful to me in many ways throughout my life and I don't feel I owe them doing something I don't like, and having them around (which will just stress me out).  So would I be the asshole?. Do I stand my ground and tell them they aren't invited? Or do I just suck it up?  Edit for clarification: while the university education I am getting would not have been possible without their financial support, they did not pay for my entire university and at this point I'm paying for everything. Not sure that makes a difference or not, just for clarification.\n",
      "Am i the asshole for wanting my boyfriend to find new friends. I am mixed and my boyfriend is white. I’m not the one to be controlling but i think this is fair. my boyfriend has racist friends. They are very ignorant towards me and they don’t respect me. They have shown this in front of my boyfriend many times but he’s a follower so he doesn’t stand up for me as he should, so they don’t stop. I’ve tried to ignore it and act like it was ok but it bothers me. i’ve talked to him many times about it and he just said, “do you not want me to have any friends, like what do you want me to do”, and tells me they’re getting better at not being fricken racist!? I don’t want him to be friend less i just think he should find 2 new different friends that aren’t racist? I don’t understand why he can’t do it for me when he has told me multiple times to drop all kinds of people, and block different people because he told me it didn’t make him feel comfortable. I had to find a whole new friend group because he wanted me to, but I did not blame this on him because I didn’t want people to talk bad on him. why is it so hard to drop 2 of your friends without making me seem like i’m the reason/problem ? Again am I the asshole?!\n",
      "So I've been living for about two years with a close friend of mine. Our apartment is alright, not wonderful not horrible, it's a pretty solid living space. In addition to the usual deadbolt lock I can open with a key, there is a small sliding lock near the top of the door that can only be opened from the inside. Think like one of the locks you see on a stall in a public bathroom. I don't know if that lock was installed by the property manager, or by the last tenant but it was there when we rented the place.   For whatever reason my roommate has insisted on not only locking the regular locks (the one I can open with my key) but engaging the sliding lock as well when she locks up after coming inside. This isn't really a problem when we're both at home, but if I'm out and she engages the sliding lock, then I have to knock on the door until she comes to open it because I can't.   My roommate is also hard of hearing, she wears hearing aids in public but often takes them out when we're at home. This means she occasionally has trouble hearing me knock, so I've had to text her to come let me in. Overall I would say I've been \"locked out\" of my apartment 4 or 5 times in the past two years. Not a lot but enough to be frustrating. Each time it happens we have a talk about her not using the sliding lock if she's the only one in the house. She'll do better for a while but then starts using it again.   The last straw was a couple nights ago. My parents live about 2 hours away, I'd been visiting them over the weekend and left for home later than I'd meant to. I wound up getting in at around 12 AM, go to open the door, and find the sliding lock is preventing me from getting in. My roommate is asleep and can't hear my knocking or see my texts. I wound up having to find a motel.  So the next morning after I manage to get back in, and she's left for work, I just decide to remove the problem. Get a drill and take out the screws keeping the sliding lock anchored to the wall. The wall doesn't exactly look pretty when I'm done (that thing was pretty firmly anchored and the screws were large) but I figure I can put it back before we move out and the landlord won't be any the wiser.   My roommate is beside herself though, she says she can't afford to lose her security deposit over this, that I've ruined the wall, and that this was an overreaction. I told her I'm tired of being locked out, and it's only a matter of time before she does this and I'll have to call someone to break the friggin door down because I won't be able to wait for her to wake up like I did this time. To say things are tense right now is kind of an understatement. AITA for taking matters into my own hands like that?\n",
      "Okay yeah I sound  kinda like the asshole already but let me break this down:  I moved in with 3 random girls about 2 months ago. Before anything was set in stone, I made it VERY clear that I like the shared spaces to be tidy. But like it doesn’t have to be spotless. Basically I just wanted the four of us to do our dishes/wipe up the counter if you make a mess/put your personal stuff away if it’s not going to be used for days. WE ALL AGREED ON THIS. 2 out of my 3 roommates have no problem with this. But my one roommate, we’ll call her G, can’t seem to manage any of it.  I have had very bad experiences with previous awful roommates. I didn’t want to go through that again. I just don’t want to live in a dirty place. I want to be able to walk in the kitchen without stepping on crumbs and find CLEAN dishes when I want to cook.  Last week G went on Vacation for a week and not only left a sink full of dishes but also trash, LITERAL TRASH in the sink. I’m sorry, I know I’m hot headed but it absolutely infuriated me. (This has also been a continued issue with G, amongst other things she does that are inconsiderate)   I decided to text our roomie group message and say that it would be nice if everyone was considerate of each other and did their dishes and threw their trash away before an extended trip. Was it a little petty? Probably but AITA? I have since been pretty much ignoring her because I know I would actually be the asshole if I talked to her.  G later went to another one of my roommates and said that since the text I sent, she’s had “so much anxiety.” BUT HAS YET TO CHANGE ANYTHING. Currently a new set of food filled dishes have been in the sink for the past two days 😡  SO AITA?!  TL;DR Roommate is the fucking worst (I.e not cleaning her dishes, leaving messes everywhere she goes, generally inconsiderate) and I called her out and have pretty much ceased contact with her as much as possible. She told another roommate she’s had anxiety since I called her out but hasn’t actually shown any initiative to do better in any way. AITA?!\n",
      "So I met this girl (let's call her Sarah) through bumble around 2 months back. We had a casual fling, but we both really enjoyed each other's company. We then made plans to hang out at least 3-4 times a week, not just purely for sex. So, around 2 weeks ago, I asked offhand if she's seen anyone else recently. She was quiet for a minute or two then said that she metup with an old friend of hers who was in the city for a few days (he lives abroad) who they had a thing going on before. She told me that they slept together for a night.  &#x200B;  I was devastated hearing this, but I didnt let it show. I messaged some of my other connections in bumble and setup a date last saturday night. Sarah asked me to watch a movie with her last saturday, but I told her I was busy. So I met and slept with the other girl. Come monday, I told Sarah the truth that I saw someone else. She was visibly hurt and wouldn't talk to me until today.  Was I an asshole? I just did what she did\n",
      "My boyfriend & I usually spend the night in a playstation party with a mutual friend. We’re a LDR couple, so communication through ps4 & our phones are essentially our entire relationship (aside from occasional meetups).  Tonight, while in the party, I asked my boyfriend to look at something I sent him on instagram and he replied “My phone is dead, it’s charging”. So we move on & a minute or two later I see that he liked the post that I sent. I’m a very petty person and I’ll admit that I gave him attitude when I blurted out “[Bf], I thought your phone was dead?”  He replies, “You dumb bitch, i turned it on” in a nasty tone and continues to berate me for 10-15 seconds after. Our friend in the party is laughing as he yells at me.  This escalated into me confronting him for calling me a dumb bitch and yelling at me. He replies saying it was a joke, he’s sorry I took it the wrong way, I’m sensitive, etc.  This isn’t the first time he’s called me a name like that... I don’t know why this time it really bothered me. It made me really sad, angry, just overall upset. Even if it was just a joke... does that make it okay if it hurt my feelings? Or am I just too sensitive?   TL;DR : My boyfriend called me a dumb bitch & yelled at me after I gave him some attitude while asking him a question. He claims it was a joke but it really hurt my feelings and made me feel mistreated.\n",
      "I (18F) have a statistics course with a long time best friend (18F) who moved back to town from Texas a year ago. Getting to spend time with her again has been really fun and nice, but I have for sure kept distance because we generally run with different friends groups since her move.  On Wednesday, I rolled an ankle when walking down the stairs and it was extremely painful. I ignored it for the majority of Wednesday, but my mother made me wear a brace and take Tylenol to get over the injury. On Thursday, I got excuses to leave early and take the elevator until it felt better. After a day with the brace, I didn't have pain so I didn't need it anymore.   Flash forward to today during my Stat class that we both have. My teacher left the class for a moment and my friend proceeds to ask my ex boyfriend sitting across the room \"X, what is the probability she faked her ankle injury?\" then my ex says \"Highly likely she just did it for some emotional attention.\" I was dumbfounded by what she said. The entire class jumped in on it except for some of my other friends in the class. I was embarrassed but tried not to let it show.  A little bit after the teacher walked in, someone randomly asked what I wanted to do with my life (I want to go into law). And my ex proceeded to say \"Something where they are really good at faking injuries\"  I am pissed to say the least, and I don't feel what she did was acceptable. She has tried apologizing since this happened this morning, and I have not spoken to her. So am I the asshole for ignoring her?\n",
      "Me(F24) and Julia(F28) have been friends for 10+ years. Both of us are from the same city but she now lives in another one 2h away. Our town doesn’t have an airport so I sometimes sleep at hers when there’s an early flight to catch. I’d make my plans around her schedule and arrive a couple of hours earlier for quality time so she doesn’t feel like I’m using her.   We were both planning trips to the same city. Initially I was going to go in summer and she was going in autumn. She invited me to join her and her bf multiple times but I declined. I ended up booking it for the same time as her (1-3 days of apart) because it was cheaper and I’d be independent. I declined her offer. She was being jokingly toxic saying “oh fine, go to your other friend” to which I just replied “I didn’t not want to go with you. Going at a different time simply works better for me”.   Later she tells me she has another trip and asks me if I had a spare suitcase. I agreed to give it to her BUT stressed the dates issue. I didn’t care about the number of trips she’ll take with the bag, what I just needed it at mine 2 or 3 days before I leave. She confirmed and took it.  Later, when she’s back, I texted her to double check everything and said “you have a second trip coming up, right? Oh so you can then use my bag again and hand it to me afterwards on the 8th, sounds cool?” Her reply was positive and I just went on with my life.   I texted her on the last day of her trip. I asked her when will she bring it back to my place. She casually tells me she’s going to be back home on the 8th and since I’m arriving on the 10th it’s “all good”. At first I thought she meant our town but no. I asked her her about the “all good” plan and she told me I can pack my stuff in another bag or just smaller bags, go with it to hers, and re-pack there. I couldn’t wrap my head about her idea because I genuinely thought it was a joke or something. It was late so I told her we’d chat tomorrow. The next day we have this conversation:    I’m not comfortable with traveling with another bag so I can move things later.  (J) idk. What’s wrong with my plan? I think it’s ideal  Am I going to go home with two bags then?   (J)You can leave it at mine  Nah, I think we should find someone who’ll be going from A to B, or maybe a bus. It’s just an unnecessary hustle  (J) Well, idk what to suggest then. I think my plan is rational.   I already suggested to find someone. A bus driver would take it for some ££  (J)Alright, I’ll send it to you after we arrive.   🫶🏻 She arrived, sent the bag with the bus, let me know and asked me when I was arriving to hers. I said on the 10th as we planned and she tells me, 2 days before when I asked her a month ago, that she won’t be able to host me because her mum is coming, and then added “I hope you have somewhere to stay?”. I said no, but I’ll figure something out.    Since then, we spoke twice. AITA?\n",
      "I (24 F) have been married with my husband (25 M) for a year, after dating for 5. Mi husband works in company since 2018, he usually go out with friends and coworkers once in a while and I stay at home since I don't have much of a social life (I'm ok with that).  Today I just found out that some of his coworkers are planning a meeting this Friday (just go out for drinks). At first I said If I could go as a joke, but my husband immediately said that I couldn't since it was just between coworkers. I really understand this, but  I don't see anything wrong in going this one time. He again tells me that I can't go, it's just between coworkers and besides, no one else brings their partners. I said to him that none of them are married so it wasn't a good excuse. He started laughing at me, saying that I'm being unreasonable, also he wasn't going to do anything inappropriate like cheating. For the record I'm not thinking about him cheating, is just that he is so adamant on me not going that it bothers me. He finally said that he doesn't want me to go because he would feel humiliated by bringing me, that his coworkers would think that I dominate him and can't go out without me. Now I'm upset about this and he keeps laughing about it. So I want to know, AITA?  EDIT: my problem is with his way of thinking. I don't have problem with my husband making plans on his own, but why would my presence humiliate him? Does bringing you wife ONE TIME ruin all the fun? Why would you get married and then feel humiliated by bringing your wife to a social event?  EDIT2: he just said to me that he prefers not attending at all than bringing me with him. I'm not forcing him, I'm not going to the social event. But I want to know if is that bad to bring your wife?  EDIT3: why people comment that I want to ruin my husband's social life? I literally just wanted to know them and go out, I guess that is enough for ruining someone's social life? :(  UPDATE: This will be my final edit. Thanks a lot for the people that where polite. I posted this because I truly didn't understand his reasoning and wanted some points of view. My intention never was to force him to take me. Although I do think that saying your wife presence is going to humiliate you is a little harsh (some say that I push him to say it but it literally was just a normal conversation, none of us were mad or fighting till he said those words). I'm obviously not attending, I understand is a coworker meeting and my presence would affect the dynamic, but I also think that they could make an exception just one time, maybe not this time. Is just that if one coworker of mine brings his spouse to a meeting I wouldn't think much about it, but that's just my point of view and now I understand more about his. Thanks a lot for your comments!\n",
      "I 26m dated Kelley 35f back in my freshman to junior year in college. After two years together she got pregnant and gave birth to Gabe(4). Gabe looked nothing like me, he looked exactly like his mom though, minus the eyes. His are green and neither of us have green eyes nor do our parents or grandparents. Anyways we broke up junior year due to her wanted to change locations and wanting to take Gabe with her while I was finishing my degree. I still saw Gabe, just less often, every 2 weeks or so. After college I tried to move closer to them, however the relationship became more strained as any time I wanted to see Gabe, there was an excuse, \"he's sick, he's got a doctor's appointment,my parents want him\" etc etc. Eventually things got better and I was able to see Gabe more consistently with the occasional string of excuses for a week. I met my current fiance during this time and we had a child last year, Penelope. My fiance encouraged me to get some sort of custody agreement so that I can see Gabe more consistently and so that he can know his sister. Part of the agreement was getting a DNA test (don't wanna go into detail) and it was revealed that Gabe is in fact not my child. I told my fiance and she said that whatever choice I make she'll support me in. It truly hurt to know he wasn't mine and I couldn't get past the hurt so I decided to cut things off as I could no longer see Gabe the same as I used to. I still feel care for him, but I have a child that is mine, that is my top priority. I told Kelley that I wouldn't be seeing or taking Gabe anymore and that I'd provide financially as I previously have, for the next year, but in that time she needed to figure something out. I asked if I could say my goodbyes this coming week and she lost it on me. She called me an ass hole for abandoning Gabe now that I have a \"real\" family and that he'll always wonder why I left him. She said a real man would do this for him. I told her that if he ever sought me out I'd tell him the truth. I've been wrestling with this for a few days and I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong.  Some details I was asked to add:  -I was 22 when I started seeing Kelley  -Gabe does have a relationship with his bio dad\n",
      "Edit: I'm sorry, I hit the wrong button while trying to fix my title. It should say \"AITA for announcing my engagement at a family gathering and taking away my cousins spotlight\"  I (24F) just got engaged to my fiance (25M). We got engaged on the 3rd and decided to wait until the 4th to tell our family. We were having a family BBQ to celebrate and thought it would be easy to tell everybody at once.   My cousins(17F) birthday is on the 7th. There were a few family members who brought her birthday gifts if they knew they weren't going to see her on her birthday. We all talk about what she is going to be doing for her birthday and the conversation eventually dies down. There a short break of quiet when my fiance and I decided to tell everybody about our engagement.  Everyone congratulated us. My cousin got really quiet. Everything was fine until I went to go get a bottle of water. I was approached by my aunt and cousin who berated me for taking away my cousins attention. My cousin was upset nobody was talking about her anymore and how she hates having a birthday so close to a holiday. The thing is, my birthday is December 24th, Christmas eve. Our family has a large party that day so we can celebrate together before having smaller celebrations on the 25th. I've been overshadowed many times with engagement and pregnancy announcements. I've always been ok with it because I know my birthday is over at 4:00 and that's when christmas celebrations start.   I reminded my aunt and cousin of this and they told me it's not the same. That I should expect it because its close to Christmas. My cousin shouldn't have to deal with my selfishness because the fourth of July isnt as important. I've received messages from my aunt and cousin after the party calling me an AH.  AITA for announcing my engagement and taking away my cousins attention?\n",
      "My family and my in laws are pretty close in a weird kind of way. so my parents are divorced and my mom is remarried to \"Rod\" and my dad is remarried to \"Vera\". My in laws are still married and everyone is friends, except my mom who doesn't get along with anyone involved. Vera and FIL are friendly with everyone, but MIL, Rod, and my dad are very close friends and hang out in a threesome all the time. My mom thinks it is weird that MIL hangs out with two men, and she has a low opinion of MIL.  Personally I hate that they are friends. It causes me so much stress, due to stupid behavior, gossiping, undermining me. Anyway my mom is very jealous and insecure and hates Vera and MIL, honestly for being thin and having good hair. Recently we all went to a waterpark to celebrate my kids last day of school, and Rod pushed MIL into a fountain after she changed into clothes, and now my mom thinks they are banging each other.  MIL was extremely offended by this, honestly not even the cheating part, but Rod isn't that great looking to be honest. My mom tried to ban Rod from seeing MIL and my dad, but he said he would just divorce her, so she begrudgingly accepted it, but my dad talked to her and assured them it is always a group of three and MIL and Rod absolutely aren't doing anything. I told MIL to just give it space and time as my mom is deeply insecure.  Well yesterday we had a birthday party for my son. MIL for some reason walked over to my mom and wanted to apologize to her and make it clear that she would never have sex with Rod. She tried to diffuse and make a joke about how Rod has a gut and makes less money than FIL, but my mom did not react well and began yelling.  I asked MIL why she would do that at my son's party and she stared at me like a deer in headlights. I got annoyed and told her to get out when she caused this shit. MIL fought with me that I was being unfair, but when she realized I was serious and left.  Now MIL is playing the victim. My dad and husband feel I coddled my mom, and I feel like an AH because despite this shit my kids love MIL.\n",
      "I (25f) have a grandmother (81f). She is widowed and when I was 12, she went to her elementary school reunion and fell in love with her childhood crush. They’ve been together for almost 14 years. We all consider him part of the family. 2 years ago I went through a really tough time and moved to be with them for a couple months. We all really bonded. She has a ring from him and they had a commitment ceremony 10 years ago which no family was present for. We all consider them married but they are not legally married. We always thought they never had any intention to get married because it made more sense tax wise.   Flash forward to today. My father(her son) is visiting for the first time since the pandemic. I just received word from my mom (her daughter-in-law) that they were supposed to get married today but that it has been pushed to tomorrow. I was shocked when I heard this. They decided to get courthouse married as a surprise since my dad was visiting. I’m obviously very happy for them but really heartbroken that plans weren’t made to have anyone else attend or plan a wedding in the future that immediate family could go to (very small immediate family). I’m extra heartbroken because I love both of them so much and I’ve been trying to make plans to visit them this summer since I’m graduating college in 3 days. My family dynamic is really weird and so my aunt isn’t married, and both of my siblings will most likely not get married either. This was kind of my one chance at going to a family wedding and I’m so upset that I can’t be there.  Am I the asshole?  Tl;dr. My grandma is getting surprise married to her long time partner and didn’t invite anyone but her 2 kids.\n",
      "Everyone mentioned in this post is in their early 20s.  I have this friend from college, let's call her J. J and I are really close friends and she is one of the sweetest people I know (or so I thought?). She is a year older than me. I've never had any problems with J and our friendship has been really great for the most part, she's very supportive, funny and caring.  She has a best friend T that is her age. I don't really know T, I just know that J has had some issues with T before in the past with T being manipulative and such. T had a boyfriend S all through college that J was also close friends with. From what J told me, it sounded like T cheated on him multiple times or whatever. Anyways, T and S broke up last year in October or November 2018 or somewhere around that time period.  J and S still remained best friends after this, and they have recently been hanging out a lot more. J recently confessed to me that she and S have been hooking up recently and been talking about dating/becoming official. I straight up asked her if T knew about this, and she said yes that she had talked to T before anything had even started with S, and T was 100% ok with it but then T had went back on her word and tried to make her feel bad about it after things started. She told me that she and T fell out weeks afterward and J just told me that her friendship with T is complicated and that she doesn't want to get into it.  I told J I'm a bit uncomfortable knowing she'd consider dating a friend's ex and wondered if she would do the same to me if I ever dated a guy in the future and he and I broke up. She said she understood my concern and would understand if I didn't want to be friends anymore. She told me that she only got together with S because she had met T and S at the same time and became close to both of them through college, and that she wouldn't go out of her way to date someone she didn't already know, and that she didn't even plan this with S. She told me she gets it regardless and she's not going to force me to stay friends with her.  I've been discussing this with friends and some understand and think it's weird that J would do that to a friend but some others side with J saying that she and the guy were already friends and that she should be allowed to explore things with whoever she wants. AITA for not thinking it's a good thing and not wanting to be friends with someone like that?\n",
      "She's really nice and sweet, but she's very religious and has very specific dietary rules.  My friend group went out for lunch a few times. She came along.  She didn't just have simple requests like \"no lettuce.\"  She had really complicated questions/instructions for the people cooking.  She wanted to know the ingredients for different sauces. She wanted to know if they used the same grill for one meat and all the others, she asked them to clean their utensils so there would be no contact--- you get the idea.  EDIT: sorry if this was unclear. These are things she had to ask for religious rules. She can’t have any contact with certain meats I think, so that can include asking the employees to clean off their knives and such, so that there are no remnants of it.   I got second-hand embarrassment from that.  Eventually she asked me if we were going to lunch and I said \"not this week\" on two separate weekends. When she found out we had gone without her, she confronted me.  I basically told her that I got second-hand embarrassment from how much extra work it gave the employees. She said \"you could have at least told me that and maybe we could have gone to a place where everything's allowed for me.\"  I might be an asshole for lying.  Maybe I'm not because I was trying to not be rude.\n",
      "I [32F] got married last month and it was almost perfect....except for my maid of honor [28F] \"Carly.\" For context, we've been friends 9 years, she has a domineering personality (I'm more quiet), she recently started making tons of money ($170K), and she complains when other people can't afford to go to nice places she wants.  Carly and her husband eloped last year (only family was invited to the ceremony) and had a reception at a nice restaurant 6 months later. We paid $1600 on travel to be there & $300 on registry gifts because they're our best friends, even though the costs were too much for our current budget (we figured it was worth it for a once-in-a-lifetime event for our favorite people).  Bachelorette party - Carly kept dragging bridesmaids into political arguments and privately joked to me about how silly it was about how religious one girl is. During brunch, Carly got in a huge fight with her mom over the phone (she stepped outside then came back and loudly ranted to any girl who would listen). I tried ending the conversation but Carly doesn't like being told to wait to talk about something and in the past has accused me of being unsupportive when I asked if we could talk about something later.  Wedding weekend: I rented a big house for all the girls & hubby rented a house for the guys but Carly & her husband decided they'd rather stay in a nicer hotel nearby. Morning of, Carly was late for make-up and asked me if the artist could also do her hair (we were on a tight schedule). My other bridesmaids got Starbucks for everyone and cooked breakfast and cleaned up the kitchen while Carly walked around on her phone and interrupted the make-up artist to ask when they could start on her.  Carly eventually convinced the make-up artist to do her hair, but then she was PISSED about the \"crooked braid\" and I heard her complaining 3 different times about what a bad job they did when were busy trying to get ready in the bridal suite (she also complained to my husband later that night). Lastly, we received their gift 2 weeks after the wedding: a set of nice wine glasses worth $80. We never asked for wine glasses because we have 30 already. I would've preferred a thoughtful card at that point.  Now that the wedding's over, I just want to move on with my life. She's not the kind of person who accepts constructive criticism (turns into a barrage of \"it didn't happen that way\" or \"you're wrong because X\"), so I don't feel like exerting the mental energy & emotional labor required to reason with someone who'll blame me (that's how our conflicts have gone over in the past, but I'm an introvert with a few close friends so I never felt like it was worth the possibility of her nuking our friendship). I still care about her, so I feel like an asshole, but I'm also tired of being treated like crap.\n",
      "English isn't my first language.  I live in India. The limits in relations are different from rest of the world here. So some things may surprise others but we all have our personal spaceMy summer vacation had started. My paternal cousin (17F) came to stay with me(17F) for few days. We aren't close much. She lives with our grandparents.We don't meet much.We lived in a joint family till I was 8. I am allowed to have my own phone and she isn't. She uses her parents phone for using social media and other stuff.  So on with the story.  When we went to my room, she started opening my cupboard(for which I got angry but didn't tell anything)and picking out my perfumes and make up. I was scared it would break seeing how she was handling it. I didn't told anything but it can seen on my face I was offended. Then she would pic showpiece from shelves to see them(The makeup,perfume which were branded and we can't afford but gifted by maternal aunt and showpiece mostly souvenirs which were gifted by maternal relatives)I told her calmly to put them back.She was offended.Some few situations happened like that afterwards. I had showed her Reddit. We would read the stories here together(we don't have much in common so this was one of only good pastime). I haven't commented or posted here before. I would only read here. So today morning I see my karma going up. But didn't looked into it much as mom called me to do dishes. After lunch when I opened Reddit my karma was in negative and I saw the comments made. I asked her about it. First she denied but then accepted it was her and said she did it cause she didn't have her own phone and I was being rude as we were first cousin so her behavior should be accepted. I was very angry because she touched my phone without my permission ( I am an introvert and like my own personal space and definitely don't like people using or touching my stuff except emergency) and also other things she did in starting. And I yelled at her that she was acting like an entitled person and has no right to touch my phone. (We would read when we were together). She went out of my room sulking and pouting Now I am feeling TA for yelling at her.When we were living and joint family but after we moved out, we grew apart. We don't know much about each other's personal life nor are close enough to talk about it and when we meet we just talk about general things. This visit was idea of my grandparents so that cousin can visit my new home, and we can bond together. We both didn't have any intrest(but couldn't say no to them).I tried to talk with her to apologize but she pretended I was not there,so I decided I won't talk unless needed with her. Now she said she was bored so I gave here my tablet to play games and open her instagram account in it till her stay.  AITA for yelling at her and not talking to her after she ignored me ?\n",
      "Ok me and my friends have a group chat on discord with other friends. We are mostly American but there’s a few people from other countries in it. Anyways all of us were in a group call and one of my friend (let’s call her Amy) asked those of us in America if we were excited for thanksgiving because she knew it was coming up in a few months. Before any of us could answer another friend (let’s call her Jane) cut in and said why would we be excited to celebrate the deaths of native Americans. When we tried to explain that we weren’t celebrating the deaths she started going on a rant about America being a terrible place and that Americans are fat and ugly people with no smart. This is when I cut in and told her to stop that she knows a few of our friends are sensitive about there bodies to which she replies they have every reason to be that they gorge their selves on food. (Two of the girls had eating disorders in the past and this really hit them hard) It was at this point that I told her she needed to leave the group chat and the call. She then messaged me that I was being an a-hole and not listening to her. Edit : I’m on phone sorry for bad grammar\n",
      "I (18F) have had my dog since i was about 10 years old. He is my best friend. My mom also loves my dog like her child, “get him this”, “make him that,” or “get my dog” even though he’s mine. I am going to college in 3 weeks and my mom is also trying to move. She’s been saying i need to find someone else to take my dog because she will not. I thought she was joking but one night she was saying it and i realized it was true, she will not be keeping my dog. I was crying and telling her to be quiet but she did not care and just told me that he should go with my aunt who bought him for me. ( she was also laughing and smiling while i was breaking down). it’s getting closer to that day and i can’t stomach giving my dog to aunt ( who lives in florida, likes to travel and lives in an apartment like condo) i can feel it coming up in me about to blow up at my mom and i do not want to. But my dog is my dog, i want him to be home.  My mom works long hours but i know if she kept she could make it work ( puppy pads and snacks around etc.) I feel she never loved my dog in the first place. But she said since she wants to downsize from a house she doesn’t want the responsibility of the dog or anything.  So, Would I be the asshole for blowing up at her?

      "One of my friends just moved into his own apartment and I’m happy for him but he moved extremely far away and literally out in the country. I went over yesterday and it was an hours drive and honestly, pretty scary. There are no streetlights near where he’s at, it’s all dark roads and surrounded by farms and pastures, literally  nothing  around and it freaked me out.   He asked me to come back over today and I said no and he got angry and said “Just say you hate my apartment and don’t want to see me” but??? It’s so far in the literal middle of nowhere and I don’t want to go out there again for awhile. I just know he’s going to keep getting angry.   AITA?\n",
      "I have a 9 year old son. My brother recently got married and has an 8 year old stepson. The boys go to the same school. My brother was hoping they would get along and my son would help his new cousin make more friends and settle in. But my son doesn't like my step-nephew. He said he's always complaining about stuff and doesn't like playing anything. He wants to spend all of lunch and recess sitting and talking and he tells other kids when their lunch isn't good for him. My son gets school lunches and on pizza day he said my step-nephew told him 7 times that pizza wasn't good for him and he was hurting himself by eating it. I have noticed these things with step-nephew. I was watching him as backup childcare for my brother and SIL and he really had no interest in playing with my kids or really anything the kids find fun. I offered him some books but none of those interested him either. And he asked a lot of questions. Like why I drink juice sometimes and not just water, why I use frozen yogurt instead of natural yogurt in smoothies and why don't we buy organic.  I answered his questions and really had no problem with it but I do see why my son and him wouldn't get along great. So as long as my son is kind I don't want to force a relationship.  My brother is pissed about it though. He said his stepson is mostly alone in school, has made no friends since starting back in September after Covid and how kids never want to come over to play. I suggested he should try some extra curricular's that could help him build up friendships but he said that's where my son should be helping because they're family. He called me a bitch for telling him I wasn't going to make my son bffs with his cousin. I told him I don't force friendships.   I think he's an asshole for reacting how he did. But do you think I should be making more of a push to get my son to be friends with my step-nephew?  AITA?\n",
      "Okay so I was texting my best friend about something I was really excited about. I had just finished writing a piece and wanted to share that excitement. She replied with a yay to that followed by, \"I was watching an insta story and was wondering who that fat dude was. Gosh you look so fat.\"   I was really upset so I just didn't even reply to that and I haven't spoken to her since. I'll talk to her when she figures it out and apologies.\n",
      "On mobile, sorry for formatting issues. Also, if the post isn’t clear enough I am a minor.  My dad recently got married to my stepmom, but we moved in awhile before that. Now, I’m not gonna say I had a bad relationship with my stepsisters. Before our parents got married, we were completely fine with each other, even though our parents were basically forcing us to be friends. I once saw my stepmom talking to my stepsister, Lacy, and pointing at me. Lacy then came over to where I was sitting, sat down and started talking to me. We were both extremely uncomfortable.  Anyway, despite all that, we had a pretty good relationship until we all moved in together. Now we barely say more that “hi” to each other whenever we’re in the same room together. The fact that we share a bathroom does not make things better. I’m perfectly fine with my older stepsister, Bree, and my older brother, Kai, though.  It seems our parents have realized that things are awkward between Lacy and I. Whenever me and my dad are alone together, he gets on me about it being awkward in the house and he says that he doesn’t want to live like that, with his kids vs. my stepmom’s kids. I asked him to give us time, as we’ve only been living together since March, we’re only with them half the month, and Lacy and I are fine with our arrangement.  My dad gave me less than a week to figure it out, and after that, he said that he and my stepmom would start forcing us together. I didn’t try starting up a conversation with Lacy once, and neither did she.   After that, my dad called me into his office and asked me to shut the door, close the blinds, and sit down. I don’t remember exactly what we spoke about, but a lot of it was him taking about how I seemed to have lost the ability to have a normal conversation with people, was rude to Bree once, and didn’t care about creating a peaceful environment. The rest was him looking at me, waiting for me to explain myself, during which he told me that we would be there all day if I didn’t speak, and me trying not to freak out. I eventually got through the talk and didn’t leave my room for the rest of the day.  I spent the next day out with friends, and the day after my brother and I went back to our mom’s. I asked her with advice, and she told me to just fake it till I make it, but I just kinda want to keep on doing what I was doing and let my dad get mad at me.  Am I just being selfish?\n",
      "Long story short my sister in law has always hated my son. He isn't my husbands child as I had my son years before I even knew my now husband. My husband loves my son and raises him as his own as my son's father died after being hit by a drunk driver. My husband loves my son, takes care of him, and sees him as his own child. His family does as well all except his sister. She has always made comments on how he is just pretending because he isn't his son to her. Well we just welcomed a baby girl last week! She came to town to meet her niece. She was here for less than 2 hours before saying \"Isn't it great to have an actual child? You are actually a father now! Not just playing one with a bastard child!\" I was LIVID I told her to get the hell out of my house. My husband grabbed her bags and threw them out the door into the snow. She looked at him crazy and said \"You're just going to let this bitch kick me out for telling the truth?\". He told her that she needs to either accept all of his children or to never speak to him again. She started crying all hysterically and left. His parents called and asked what happened. She was at their house expecting to stay there till she goes back home. We told her and they were livid. Kicked her out and told her to grow up. So now she is freaking out on facebook telling lies and trying to attempt to make herself look like I turned the whole family against her and now she is forced to pay for a hotel and be all alone. I have people messaging me and my husband. A lot of people hear our side and then side with us... but some say I need to stop being a sensitive bitch. So are we the assholes?\n",
      "So I'm a college student and have recently taking up swing dancing. I did this for a variety of reasons.    I have a friend doing it so it was easy to start  I stopped doing marching band so I needed something to fill the time  I was told by a long time friend that it's filled with cute girls and I could maybe pick up a date.   Yeah that last one is kind of shifty but there is reason behind it. I'm a engineer. Notoriously bad with women and tinder is not friendly to me. The goal was to gain confidence in a new skill while being in constant contact with women which would force learning on my part. While I wasn't going in on pure intentions I had really no other choice and going on 2 years single I decided to at least try.  So I start dancing. Getting the hang of it and making friends fast. Then there is this girl. Super bubbly and giving me attention on and off the dance floor. She was a southern country girl who I saw as someone I could ask on a date. But after we rotated partners she would do the same thing to the next guy so I had my doubts she was truly into me.   I started to spend more time around her. Intentionally  and to gage her reaction. She always seemed more interested in other guys but would give me the light of day. More than I was expecting so I was on the hook and I kept trying to impress her in some way to make her think I was worthy.  This is where I think I fucked up. Last session we had a pool dancing session where we would dance in the pool with the resistance and then we could dance better while in the studio. Back at the studio we danced together and I was messing up all the time. Stepping on her toes, all the wrong counts, and just had to take a step back from it all. She tried encouraging me which was the attention I seeked but I still wanted to show her I was learning and capable. She then said \"wait are you trying to impress me?\" \"Ugh men\" and that was the signal to in my mind \"back off freak\"  So that happened and I didn't think too much about it. But after the fact I was with a friend at a party (drunk cause college) and he said that he had talked to her and she just annoyed that I was flirting with her. But he also admitted that he thought she was into him for a time because of being bubbly and giving guys tons of attention.   So what do I do? I feel like I made her hate me and I was to apologize for flirting with her when I couldn't pick up that she wasn't into me at all. Or should I just go to the next lesson and pretend like nothing happened and try not to be flirty at all?  Lesson is tomorow night  TLDR: flirted with a friend who obviously isn't into me and is now annoyed.  Pease ask me for any clarifying info as well  Bad spelling cause I'm stupid\n",
      "My (18f) ex-boyfriend (18m) and I broke up about a month or two ago. I broke up with him, and he didn't seem to take it too well at first, but we later agreed to stay friends. A few days ago, he apologized for \"being an asshole, and blaming you at the end\". No problem, apology accepted. He did seem stressed, so I told him if he needed to talk, he could text me.  During our relationship, I was always there to help him find a way through his emotions, find a way to calm down, and think clearly. I used to do breathing exercises with him, I tried to help him find a logical way through his emotions, and talk through his emotions.  He texted me for over an hour, talking about our first two months, how they were \"magical\", etc. He probably would've kept going if I hadn't cut him off.  I asked if he was sure he wanted to tell me all this and brought up confidential resources that have professional counseling, since he seemed to be in a bad spot, but he completely rejected them, saying he was fine, didn't need it, but continued to wallow in self-pity.  I was getting really pissed off, so I called him out. I first said it was a guilt trip, but he was all \"no, not a guilt trip, I'm not trying to guilt you.\" Then, he brought up something I REALLY didn't want to relive, and it happened during our relationship. I told him, and he said \"sorry about that\", but 1 minute later, he brought it up AGAIN. He brought up things related to that memory a total of 2 times after I told him to stop.  I exploded. I told him that it was him never listening to me when I tell him to stop is why I broke up with him. I called him a manipulator, saying that manipulators say they're sorry, but they keep doing it. I told him that the relationship is over, and that just because I was nice to him, didn't mean that he could go around subconsciously guilt tripping me, and that if he couldn't do that, then consciously realize what he was doing. I asked him what the point of re-telling our relationship from his point of view was. What did he want me to do? Comfort him?  I told him if he regretted things so much, “move on and become a better person who listened when people told him to stop, listened when people told them they were uncomfortable, didn't manipulate people, and didn't guilt people into doing things”. I then gave him 10 more minutes to say whatever else he wanted to say, because I was so pissed off. I have pretty much ceased contact with him. My friend called me a queen for putting him in his place (now that I look back at it, he had been pulling a lot of guilt trips and was manipulative when we were in a relationship too), but I can't remember the last time I got mad like that. I feel terrible since I was the one who said \"you can text me if you need to vent\". I meant it, but that didn't mean that he could completely ignore what I was saying- AITA?\n",
      "My roommate, we’ll call her Ashley(19F), and I  (20F), moved in this fall semester into our off-campus apartment. My parents, more specifically my dad got us the apartment as our guarantor, as we definitely do not make 3x the rent. Other than that, Ashley and I split utilities and rent 50/50, only that my parents pay for my half along with the insurance expenses we needed for both of us to occupy the apartment. My parents has done a lot for us in the sense that they completely furnished our apartment with everything we needed(shared things), from couch, dining tables, decor, tv’s you name it. I’ve always been thankful for that of course.   It’s come to my attention that Ashley has completely been super neglectful and inconsiderate about a number of things. It first started off with leaving the kitchen super dirty, not cleaning after herself after eating at the dining table, being super inconsiderate about using my kitchen ware when I’m in a rush to go to class. But recently, its gotten to the point where she would leave for more than 4 days at a time, and in such a rush to go to her boyfriends house, she would be leaving out dishes and food to rot.   One of the bigger issues I had was when her boyfriend would come over multiple times during weekdays, I would have exams to study for or online classes to attend and they would be super loud and obnoxious. I’ve also noticed that they would be taking damn near 3hr showers (like ya’ll got water bill money, or what?🤨)Oddly, enough there were multiple times he’d brought his laundry into our home to do… even though he has his own apartment. I’ve also noticed she completely neglects the shared chores of cleaning and completely avoids adding her share of things when it comes to buying detergent to wash kitchen towels, shared cleaning products. Like I mentioned, my parents pay a lot for the things we have, and pay all my expenses, I just feel like she sees that as a free pass to never add her share into things..This is just a peak into some of the issues we have… Would it be unfair to completely tell her I don’t think it’s fair that I have to continuously clean up after and remind her what to do in our home, and essentially set rules? Also, that I don’t think it’s fair or appropriate to have her boyfriend at our home everyweek? (Honestly, even at all, considering he has his own apartment they can stay at and make all the noise they would like?) I have told her that I certainly was against having her boyfriend over on multiple occasions if he didn’t plan on respecting my wishes and even as much as kicking them both out at this point… She simply laughed at what I said and brushed it off, which she tends to do everything time I address an issue with her. Since then I’ve been pretty much given them the cold shoulder whenever they’re around.  Since the semester is coming to an end, we’ve been trying to find new roommates and a new home to occupy. She’s been very adamant about all these luxuries of a home and new roommates but has yet to put in effort to find them, and is also weirdly enough expecting to pay less than $700 for all the luxuries of her own bathroom and bedroom (Like miss ma’am we live in California….LOL).The only thing is, at this point I dont know if I even wanna room with her…\n",
      "I(15F) just dropped out of my sister’s (19F) wedding and my family is pissed. My sister is getting married to her fiancé(20M) in one week and now I have dropped out leaving her without a bridesmaid. I never wanted to be a bridesmaid from the beginning and I made that very known as I don’t like standing up in front of people and tend to avoid social interaction all together but my mother has forced me to be a bridesmaid. The main reason I did not want to be a bridesmaid tho is because of future BIL. We have never got along all tho I have tried many times to find common ground to get along with him. Tho he always makes backhanded comments about my height and weight and my family just passes over them saying he’s joking. My height and weight is something I’m very insecure about because I’m short and chubby while the rest of my family is on the leaner and taller side of things. Today was the final straw when BIL made a backhanded comments out of no where comparing me to an Oompa Loompa in front of about 20 people. I quickly removed myself from the situation leaving the room and sitting outside to calm down. That still didn’t stop him from coming outside to tease me even more. And that was the straw that broke the camels back. I told them they could find someone else to be a bridesmaid because I wasn’t doing it. He then went and told my friends and family, who is now pissed at me for refusing to be a bridesmaid. AITA?  Update: sister just came outside and yelled at me saying I have no reason to drop out of the wedding and saying i should just suck it up since it’s her wedding not mine  Edit: I’m trying to read all of your comments but I want to thank all of y’all for the support already. <3  Update: there was 2 bridesmaids drop out last minute from the wedding which I did feel bad for and helped. It wasn’t all a bust tho. I got paired with a really cute boy my age to walk down the aisle with. I hung out with him till we left the ceremony and I got his number and have been talking to him since last night. I avoided them as much as possible tho and it seemed to help. I don’t think I talked to BIL any. I honestly don’t know where he got his personality from his family is super sweet. The wedding ceremony was short which helped with the fact that I could avoid them. I know this isn’t much of an update but not much happened surprisingly.\n",
      "This might seem a bit of a weird one, but I (27m) just want to understand if I'm actually being unreasonable here. My other neighbour Jackie (65f) thinks I'm being an AH, however my partner (27f) is siding with me.  Our new neighbours are about in their 40s (I do not know their exact age, and I only know the name of one of them, Stephen).   Our row of houses are detached, and the way they are configured means that the outside extraction vent for our cooker hood is positioned so it faces our neighbour's side of their house and I suppose if the wind hits right, into their back garden.   So when we cook, those cooking \"fumes\" may sometimes blow into their garden (same with us with the neighbours the other side).  On Saturday I was cooking eggs, sausage and bacon for our breakfast. Pretty much as soon as I had finished cooking and we sat down to eat we had a knock at our front door, it was our new neighbour Stephen.   He was polite enough and asked if we would not cook at this time of the day. (it was just after 11am), as they normally like to sit outside, he said it might not have been as bad if we were not cooking bacon, which he requested we do not cook at ANY time, due to the fumes sometimes reaching inside their house if they have their side window open.  I said it would be difficult for us to cook at any other time as we both have varying work hours, so basically we cook to eat together whenever we can. I also asked why doesn't he want us to cook bacon, he advised his wife does not like it, that the smell upsets her and makes her nauseous.   This is where I may be the AH - I told him straight that we would continue to cook anything we want and at any time, I said I understand some foods are not to everyone's preference but it's not our fault that the smell drifts over sometimes, and they could just close the window when it's being cooked? I also explained that sometimes we get cooking smells from the other side and either ignore it or close a window if we don't want it coming in the house.  He said I was being unreasonable and that neighbours should look out for each other and make compromises, I agreed but not when it comes to cooking food in your own home. He then likened it to blasting music saying that it can be an offence to disrupt your neighbours enjoyment of their house.  At this point I said there's nothing I can do to help, he will need to close the windows if any cooking smells offend them.  I got a hand written letter this morning explaining they were going to contact the council to complain about our cooking smells, and that's when I told the neighbour the other side (Jackie) about it, however she agreed with them, saying we should stop cooking those foods and be more considerate. This is why I'm left unsure as to if I'm the AH.   So help me out guys and gals, am I being unreasonable here?\n",
      "Ok, so this took place a few months ago. At this time, I was stressed about my grandma's condition because she had to go to the hospital a lot from a problem she had (I think it was a bladder problem????). I was really concerned because 1. COVID was (and still is) a thing, and I was worrying about her catching it at the hostpital. 2. I didn't want her condition to get worse. 3.There were a ton of riots that were happening in the city where she and my grandfather lived, and there were reports of places that were literally 2 miles away from their house getting demolished, cars being broken into, etc. ^ With those things worrying me, I talked to some of my irl friends about it, and I expressed my concerns. One of my \"friends\" (we'll call him K) completely invalidated my concerns. K just brushed it off and said \"lmao she's going to be fine\" as if it was nothing. This really hurt me, because I've treated K with respect, since I was under the impression that he would do the same for me. And I know that if  I  said what K said to me if he was in a similar situation as I was, he would absolutely go off on me.  I decided to suspend contact with K after that, because I felt like I was disrespected. Then, about a month later, I got some messages from him that said I shouldn't be mad at him because he told me to stop complaining about my family's safety. (Dude, do you even read what you type??) I didn't want to deal with him, so I left him on read. I was doing a lot better by not talking to him. Then,   he   told me that he did not want me to speak to him anymore and he no longer wanted to associate with me.  AITA for ignoring him and cutting him out?\n",
      "A couple weeks ago I [31M] was unfortunately laid off from my job. The job market has been quite tough, but at least I am able to qualify for unemployment benefits (which is only a fraction of my salary, but enough for me to get by just on that). In addition, I've saved up over $200k over the last couple of years, but most of this money is in stock. Regardless, I've been trying to cut back on frivolous things while I try to find a new job, and this has been a point of contention with my partner [30F].   My partner made quite a bit less than me, so while I was employed, I took her out on dates all the time and gave her gifts. However, since losing my job, I've been cutting down on dates (I try to stay in as often as I can and make a homecooked meal, or ask to split the bill at restaurants), and haven't given her any gifts.  My partner knows how much money I have, but my thinking is that this money is for the future, and I shouldn't be wasting it on needless purchases. We're both relatively young and have no kids, and so we can get by without using much money.   The other day, my partner asked me if we could go to a concert. The tickets were over $100 each, so I told her that I can't cover for her and wasn't willing to shell out that much money to buy tickets for myself either, but I told her that she should go with her friends since she's a big fan.  She got really mad at me and called me a cheapskate, saying that I had more than enough money to buy tickets even if she is paying for herself, that money is made to be enjoyed, and that I'm being a real \"scrooge\" for hoarding money for no reason. I told her I was in no mood to argue and that my answer was final, and she went away sulking.   If I had a job, then I would be more than happy to buy concert tickets for both of us, and I've done that all the time in the past. While it's true that spending an extra $200 won't put a dent in my savings, I don't have a stream of income right now (not including unemployment), and I'm not sure when I might be able to land a new job. I also don't want to make frivolous purchases here and there, because even though I have a good chunk of money right now, those purchases are going to add up sooner or later.   Am I the asshole here? I'm not sure if I'm being financially sensible, or maybe I am being too cheap and need to enjoy myself.\n",
      "My school tends to have crowded hallways, and bumping into each other happens a lot. Whenever I bump into someone, I really want to say sorry, but I’m terrified of saying it the wrong way or something, so I end up inaudibly whispering it or just lip-syncing the word. It makes me feel like a horrible person whenever I do it. Am I an asshole?\n",
      "Last week she (24F) broke up with her boyfriend and he kicked her out of the apartment they shared because it's his, and now she's staying at her brother's house but she doesn't want to stay there anymore because he wants her to babysit her three kids even though the agreement was that she would only pay rent, the internet bill and her food.  So yesterday she texted me (24F) and asked if she can stay at my place until she finds an apartment, and I would have gladly said yes but she has two cats and my husband (43M) is allergic to them, so I told her that she could stay but not her cats, for obvious reasons, and she told me that she has nowhere to leave them and that she doesn't want to lose them and that she would pay for my husband's medication for his allergy until she finds an apartment.  I talked to my husband about it and he told me that he doesn't want any cats in the house, so I told my friend that she can't stay here with her cats, and she accepted it and will stay with her brother until she finds an apartment. But a friend that we have in common (she lives in another city so she can't let my friend stay at her house) texted me saying that I was being a horrible friend, that my husband's allergy is not that serious and that if he can take medication to feel better then I could let her stay here with her cats. That she's been my friend since we were kids and that not helping her just because my husband doesn't want to makes me an asshole  It's true that he can treat his allergy with medication but he hates cats and I can't make decisions by myself, this is also his house and he can also decide who can stay and who can't. Am I the asshole for not letting her stay?\n",
      "So me (26m) my little brother (24) and his gf (23) having been living together since 2020 in a 2 bedroom apartment. I have been able to tolerate her for a bit, but I'm at my breaking point with this gremlin.  I spend almost no time outside my room aside from using the kitchen or my bathroom. She mutilates the kitchen regularly by piling the dishes up past the brim of the sink almost everyday, and never cleans up after making food. (Meat juices crusting up on the stove is a grand example) I told her to put her dishes in the dishwasher after she rinses them out only to be met with resistance. (Also doesn't rinse out dishes) \"Dirty dishes go in the sink.\" Big argument w/e. So I just start ignoring her since every talk since then becomes a shouting match, not worth it.  She owns 3 cats as well. One of which can't ever find the litter box. Woke up one time to the smell of defecation, found a nug in my laundry basket. Turns out she had actually crapped in my bed when I was asleep. So I strip my bed and leave it out for the gf to clean since it's her cat. Refused. Same cat pees all over my bath rug. Also refuses. Instead, goes behind my back to my friends and tells them \"He pisses on the floor, that's why she does.\"   What.  Then complains to my brother that I talk shit behind her back to my friends. No shit I am now, I cannot believe she said something so insane.  I should also say that I also have the unpleasantries to work with her. She is constantly behind on her work, then ships it off to other people. I keep telling her I'm not going to do her work, she's not my manager. Also has her nose so far up HR's ass that she cannot be blamed for anything.   This is one of my favorite stories here at job. Someone went rummaging through a coworkers drawer for some floss. Said coworker was out that day and didn't really care. GF takes it to HR and says that it was her desk that got rummaged though. HR president is hugging and consoling her telling her she's so sorry that happened to her.  Now my brother is pissed at me since I stopped talking to her. I just can't. She manipulates everything with her grubby hands. Tells me to stop being an asshole.  Am I an asshole? Is this an overreaction on my part?  Edit: This is for the cat.  She is medically healthy (been to the vet twice) and at one point we had 4 litter boxes. 2 in the living room and 1 in each bathroom, still wouldn't use one. We speculate that it has to be that one of the other cats is territorial, but we have no idea.\n",
      "As some background I am 25 and work 3 jobs and live the next town over from my mom.  Yesterday my mom fell and broke her ankle.  She messaged me after her fall and said she was hurt, i offered to take her to the the hospital and she messaged back saying it was all good she was already on the way to the ER with my dad.  Shortly later she says its a broken ankle and she will be getting a boot put on her. I tell her to relax/listen to her doctorm.  I then get ready for work in an hour and continue my day.  So flash forward I work until 8:30pm and I am on the way to the store taliking about maybe bringing my mom dinner or doing some housework tomorrow (now today) for her.  Then I get a call from dad at 9pm asking why i didn't come see my mom. I can hear her in the background yelling about me not coming over.  \"Nobody fucking cares\" kinda stuff.  And my dad started telling me what happened like I didn't know and I told him about how I already knew and she had told me what happened.  I hear her walk out of the room still yelling.  My dad is obviously trying to get me to apologize but I don't see why.  I am an adult, I have  jobs. It's not like she had a heart attack or serious injury.  I fractured my arm before and my nose and it wasn't a big family event, of course in the days after i got some attention.  I could understand her being mad if she was in like a car accident or had a major health problem but I am not calling off work when you break your foot to go sit in the ER all day.  It sucks, I have hurt myself before, but I feel like she is acting unreasonable just for attention. I had planned on helping her throughout the week since 1 of my 3 jobs is right by her.  But honestly I don't really want to now.  I know she is gonna scream and guilt trip me or just completely ignore me when I go there (she does this crap where she will refuse to talk and intentionally leaves the room or takes phone calls while I'm there and then flips shit about me not spending time with her before leaving).  Am I the asshole or is my mom acting like a child?  UPDATE:  i no longer care if I am the asshole. when I went to her house to visit today and she blamed me for the fall because I should have helped her take care of her yard and if I would have she wouldn't fell in her garden.\n",
      "My wife has a tendency to leave our very safe very suburban security camera monitored garage door open. To accomplish this she ignores her garage door opener in her car as well as the one 18 inches from the handle of the door she has to use to enter the house. Since my tools and her car (which she leaves her keys in since she has push to start) have yet to be stolen by this practice she is convinced that, “it’s fine.” I have asked no less than dozens of times for her to cease this practice.  Discussion regarding the issue has informed me that visual memory queues are an unacceptable solution to her. Thus I have decided that I should incur her an immediate consequence.  My solution is to grab a knife from our knife drawer and play “fruit ninja” by grabbing a piece of fruit from our basket and slicing it midair (safely). This practice is infuriating and pointless to my wife. I am trying to provide some absurdity that may spark her memory.  TLDR: If my wife leaves the garage door open I play fruit ninja to annoy her, AITA?\n",
      "Okay so I (40s f) am with my husband (40s m) for 6 years now. He has a daughter from a previous marriage, Emma (13f). She's a lovely kid . I have a daughter, Julie (10 f).   Now you might think this going to be another post about step siblings not getting along with each other or the step parent but honestly this is not the case. I really would have never expected this, especially with all the stories on reddit about step families but those two girls have warmed up to each other incredible well.  My husband and I did not expect that, with them both being a couple years apart, only children before and Emma already being 10 at the time.   Yet they genuinely enjoy each other's company, we are not forcing them to hang out (other than things like family meal time with exceptions) yet they almost every night watch a movie together or play something.  So onto the actual issue: my mom really wanted to treat my daughter to a holiday at her place (close to beach, pool, big house) and go to Disney with her. I was invited to. Originally she asked  just us (she lives really far away and we used to live there when Julie was younger so they bonded but she only saw Emma a couple times) But Julie asked to include Emma on her own merits and my mom was absolutely fine with it since she wants to get to know Emma and it will be great for Julie to have someone her age rather than us oldies (lol)  My husband won't be able to come due to work. I, before saying anything to Emma, talked to her mom which I am totally cool with and we communicate often enough. She was completely on board with Emma going, even offered to pay. Just said that obviously it's up to Emma.  Well Emma wants to go, so I considered it to be a safe deal.  My husband, who I did not consult about it as i assumed he was thrilled and since I asked the main custody parent (emma stays with us lots since we live close to her mom and she likes it but technically hubby only has visitation) He was overseas in a different time zone for a few days due to work so we did not communicate much in those days. It just didn't feel like the most important information honestly but this might make me an ah/in the wrong  He has a big issue with Emma going but wouldn't say why, just called me an asshole for all this. I don't understand  Reddit, AITA for inviting my stepdaughter on a holiday\n",
      "I've started a business as a freelance copyeditor. Copyediting is something I've loved doing for years and gotten good at; I've always taken it very seriously. I've struggled with my pricing as, like many people starting new service-based businesses, I've undervalued myself. I've ended up choosing prices that are lower than the industry's standard (cus I'm a newbie) but still make my work feel worth it.  My mother sent me a personal statement (not hers) today and asked me what I'd charge for editing it. I was surprised and happy about this cus the last time she asked me to do something like this she told me I shouldn't charge her because she's my mum. I thought this time she really wanted to support my business and understood that my time and effort are valuable.   I told my mum the rate I charged and informed her that it's lower than the industry standard. She was unhappy paying that price and said I need a \"friends and family discount\". I told her that you can't support a small business by trying to short-change them; she said this is different cus she's my mum. I offered her a lower rate, but she still wasn't happy.  I sensed that any price I gave would irritate her, so I chose to ask her how much she's willing to pay. She said she wasn't expecting to pay anything, but she wanted to help me out by giving me something cus she knew I'd be using my time. She also said if I edited the statement, she'd promote my business.  I was disappointed to hear this cus it gave \"this job will pay you in experience\" energy. Her unwillingness to pay the rates I'm offering makes me feel like she doesn't appreciate how much time and energy it takes to edit stuff, especially something as hefty as a personal statement.   I asked how much this \"something\" she wanted to give me would be; she refused to provide a figure. I insisted she give me a number cus I didn't want a situation where she offers a ridiculously low payment, and I feel like she's taking the piss. There was a back and forth where my mum kept reminding me that she's my mother and that she's being nice by offering to pay me since she could tell me to do it for free. Then I expressed that I worry she's underestimating how much work she's asking me to do and not valuing my skills.   I'm unsure if she got my point cus the conversation ended with her getting frustrated and telling me she's not paying. I gave up and asked her what the deadline is. I know I could've said I won't edit the statement, but the potential guilt trip and hostility I'd endure doesn't feel worth it.   I wonder if it was unreasonable for me to suggest my mum pay full price since family discounts aren't unheard of. Should I not have been business-minded? I don't know.\n",
      "So I've been planning something fun for my 30th birthday for a handful of months now. It's been a rough year with work, dating, and just life events, and Ive always wanted to do something fun for my 30th.  I originally wanted to travel abroad but didnt feel comfortable with COVID still being around. So I decided to go to hawaii. I asked a bunch of friends if they wanted to join and one was able to due to money, and time. She was stoked and took to planning with me right away. We've been planning it for 2 months. I bought books on her recommendation and everything's been booked for over a month now. Last week she called and said she's going to be looking into home loans and their watching her spending. So requested we switch vacation rentals and I put it under my name,  (it has free cancellation up to a week prior). Easy enough. The rental required a 2000 dollar down payment in case we did damaged (my parents were once scammed by a situation like this so I felt uncomfortable choosing this option) or a 75 dollar security fee that I would not get back. With remembering my parents experience, i opted for the 75 dollar non refundable fee. We also had booked activities, most I can cancel for both of us for free but a handful I can not. Think around 200ish for both of us.   So we are set to head out in 10 days. Until I get a call from my friend today telling me she bought a house this weekend, and can no longer afford the trip.  Beyond being upset about this timing, and trying not to be selfish due to understanding shes making a wonderful life step for herself, I'm pretty hurt, disappointed and also would kind of want to be reimbursed for the costs I can not refund, like the security deposite and some of the activities.   Since she was the one who canceled so last minute WIBTA if I ask her to repay me for those costs?\n",
      "My husband and I are hosting Christmas for his family this year. We invited his parents, his brother and two of his sisters. But his middle sister and her family are not invited. This decision was reached after a discussion with my husband and the rest of his family. The decision has been controversial and the sister is hurt she and her family weren't invited.  Our reasons go into how her kids behave and how she and her husband allow them to behave. It's all food and hygiene centric too.   Kids don't wash hands before food and will walk around with dirty hands. Kids will grab food from others plates, swap food and touch food with those dirty hands. Will lick food to claim. Have taken loads of food to throw in the trash all because they didn't want others to have it and not them. They won't listen to any of the adults in the family. The parents don't give a shit. Nothing we try to minimize the bad behavior and lack of hygiene has helped and we're all tired of bringing it up. I think the worst example I can give is earlier this year my husbands parents had hosted a BBQ. The two kids were playing in mud and one may have even touched dog crap in the grass and then they run up and touch burgers that were on the grill. Neither of their parents said anything and acted like we were overreacting for not wanting to eat them.  So we made the decision. SIL came straight to me and said her kids (ages 7 and 8) would feel heartbroken to be left out and not see cousins and the rest of the family. And that's where I doubt the decision. Because the kids aren't at fault really. They're not being taught right and see their parents disregard for listening to others and follow it.   Yet I really don't want to have dirty hands all over our Christmas dinner.  It's so tough.  AITA?\n",
      "Usually I have to be the one who does all the laundry because my boyfriend will forget about it or just mess it up, but he is capable of doing laundry if he needs to.   We have lived together for over 2 years and we just moved in with roommates so we came up with a laundry schedule where each person or couple gets two days a week for laundry and one extra day anyone can do their laundry. On our first laundry day we went to do laundry and saw that our roommates were doing a load on our day and we just let them finish up quickly since the schedule is new, they probably forgot, and we just didn’t want to cause drama right away. My boyfriend and I didn’t like that they did that and I just wouldn’t want to do that to anyone else. Well I finished our laundry those two days and I asked my boyfriend several times if he wanted the shorts he was wearing to be washed and reminded him it would be another week until I could wash them and he kept saying no.   He continued to wear his shorts throughout his days off knowing that he only has 4 pairs. Well today he went back to work and he didn’t have any clean. He had to grab a dirty pair and asked me to ask our roommate if I could do laundry today. I told him I didn’t want to do that since we have two designated days and I asked him several times on our laundry days if he wanted me to wash them. I also warned him against wearing his shorts on his days off when he wanted them for work.   He got upset with me and kept telling me I should ask him because the roommate (not even the ones who did it on our day) will probably be fine with it and he isn’t doing laundry right now anyway. I told him no because I really don’t want to take someone else’s day from them and I would like everyone to stick to the schedule since our days are the easiest for us because of our work schedules. I also told him I just honestly don’t want to do his laundry when I asked him several times on the two days we had and I already had to do all the laundry and I’ll have to do it again in a few days. Now he’s upset with me and thinks I’m TA because I’m home today anyway and the washing machine isn’t currently being used.\n",
      "My (15f) mom (47f) and I recently moved to Northern California. My brother (18m) still lives in the town we moved from which is in Arizona down close to the border. This means the drive was going to be about 14 hours give it take. My moms new boyfriend (44m), let’s call him Lewis has only met me two times and both times it was a short interaction. (once was dinner at our house and the second time was in passing when he stopped by) Now just to give some backstory my mom has dated a lot of men. There have always been different men in mine and my brothers lives that she thought was “the one”. Not an every weekend thing but like 2 a year. My dad was never in the picture. Needless to say I don’t really get attached to these men and it takes me a while to warm up to them. I don’t want anyone thinking that my mom is some promiscuous thing though, she is an absolutely amazing mother who always puts her kids first which is kind of how I’m left feeling like the AH. So a few weeks ago my mom said we were driving down to AZ to visit my brother. I can’t drive yet and as mentioned before it’s a long drive. My mom asked me how I’d feel if Lewis came along because he drives for a living and he could do most of the driving so that way we wouldn’t have to stop. I agreed begrudgingly but I definitely understand not wanting to drive that alone. Anyways, flash forward to us on the road and somewhere in hour 9 they both decide that we have to stop for the night? I had my headphones in so I don’t know if they were tired or stiff but regardless we stopped. I was under the assumption I’d get my own room considering I had only met this strange man once but upon reflection I may have been presumptuous and a little bit of a princess. We don’t have a lot of money so another room was a big deal. After my mom booked one I pulled her aside and asked her why she hadn’t gotten 2 and she asked if I was being serious. We argued a little and I cried just out of the fear of knowing how uncomfortable being around him would be and it was still early evening so it wasn’t like we would go up and just sleep. My mom caved and got another room which was awkward to tell Lewis. I apologized and said I just wasn’t comfortable sharing a room with a man who is practically a stranger. He said he understood but it was just…tense afterwards. So aita?\n",
      "So basically I'm not talking about the shit move of having a speaker or just playing music from my phone. No from my earbuds I'm hard of hearing [i know its not good to put it on full blast so I don't do it all the time]. And so yea I turn it to max volume and well I guess you can hear the music when I have my earbuds on if the music is at full blast [i listen to some screaming songs sometimes because its just so incredibly loud on full blast but usually I listen to pop music]. And its loud enough to hear the lyrics I have been told. And I guess it bothers people. But I don't know I'm 14 so I cant afford some really expensive headphones. And I have tried mutiple ear buds and the wrap around earbuds and also headphones I also have airpods to but with everyone when It doesn't keep the sound in. So i just go on having people hear my music i have had people say its not really that loud then others say its really loud. And some people they say its annoying and others don't really care. I have recently had lots of people say that its so loud and annoying. I mean i checked to see if it was connected blue tooth and yes it was so i mean it cant be that loud to others right? I have been told to stop but i don't really listen. So AITA?   IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE LOUDNESS:Also so if you want to know what volume then put some [dont recommend if you have perfect hearing it might be extremely shocking loud since its normal loud to me] apple earbuds or if you have airpods and on my iPhone I turn it all the way on normal the buttons but also under the music setting in EQ I have it set to \"late night\" so its supposed to make it louder. And then in \"volume limit\" I set it to max volume which by the way made me push some accept button to do. Then Finially I song I like to listen to just to get itch that part of me that wants LOUDNESS I will start by listening to Floor 555 by.)XXXTENTACION . Ok then I guess ask a friend with good hearing if they can hear it and if they can if its loud or not and if its annoying or not really?\n",
      "(f), love my boyfriend. We have met in our early teens and are still together after more than a decade, even though our road wasn't the smoothest. He had always been the type to not think about tomorrow and randomly bought useless items he never even looks at, rage at video games and makes them out to be some sort of serious competition and sadly holds up a \"I am better than you all\" attitude at work. Don't get me wrong. He cares and loves me and is the most gentle guy when it comes to me. Ever since my childhood I had dealt with trauma, depressions, panic attacks and social anxiety. He has tried a lot to help me and he makes me feel at ease. Couple years back, he was disgnosed with a chronical IBS health issue triggered by stress. We talk about heavy cramps, nasty toilet time and having trouble eating. His last episode started a few months prior and I tried to get him to eat by the plan his doctor gave him. Sadly, he believes his body can run on only orange juice, energy drinks and snacks. Due to an increase of stress, his problems became heavier and his doctor gave him streng steroids which were meant to be taken in for 12 weeks and then finally kick in. For some reason, he started to distrust the medication after not even half the time and I noticed how he got the idea that medication does not help him but that the doctors just want to make money of the pills they give out (he pays nothing as he lives in a country with public health care.). He even started to think that other medication are useless and became a giant grump. He complains all day about his cramps, having actual issues to go to work with this but he is in a financial position where he has to be careful (Our finances are split as we are long distance since a couple months). He also started to yell and rage a lot. Not towards me but about the most trivial things in front of me. Also becoming more and more cynical, saying a lot of mindless things. It hurts me a lot... He knows that I am bad at taking his yelling and overall, each day I have to listen to him talking about how bad he feels for hours. I want to help him but he won't go to a doctor, nor try to change his lifestyle. I feel like IATA ever since I cannot take his complains anymore. I want to help him but each day I feel restless because he ignores all ideas and advices. I want to talk for once again about my day for more than a minute before I am shut down by complains about his day full of cramps. I want to eat food without him telling me he didn't eat anything all day because he felt sick. I want him healthy but also want to not be a complaint box, but be listened to as well. He annoys me so much with how he acts but AITA for thinking like that?\n",
      "I’m on a small team of software developers. Four months ago K joined the team. The thing about K is she’s ALWAYS going to the bathroom. She’ll go twice as much as anyone else when we have team meetings. And sometimes she’s in there for 20ish minutes at a time several times a day.   I noticed when she goes to the bathroom she always grabs her phone and takes it with her. So I told her at lunch one day it’s not cool for her to just fuck around in the bathroom on her phone during meetings and that she needs to do as much work as the rest of the team. She told me it’s none of my business and she still gets all her work done.   That just pissed me off so I told her that she doesn’t get to do whatever she wants just because she’s the only woman on the team. She got very quiet for a moment and then once again told me it was none of my business. She then said that her going to the bathroom so much is a disability accommodation and if I didn’t drop it she would file a complaint with HR. But she’s in her mid 20s and she works out a lot and is very obviously not disabled so I told her so.   Now our manager who is also the CTO wants to talk to me and I’m just so annoyed because she’s obviously just fucking around, but I guess that pointing that out makes me the asshole. So Reddit, what do you think?\n",
      "So, I have Depressions and my parents know that very well. I have been in therapy for a couple of times and years, but I still get days were I just feel like crap.  On one of those days, I just wanted to be alone, listen to my music, play the guitar etc and just be on my own. I still live with my parents, so I got up in the morning and told them, I wasn't feeling well and explained that I wanted to be alone.   My mother refused and told me I should just get over it and should spent time with my parents, because they want me to. I said, I couldn't and wanted to leave. I wasn't in the mood of discussing it, so I just went to my room. My mother followed me to my room and sat down on my bed and wanted me to talk to her, which I didn't wanted to. She called me an AH for not talking about it.   (My mother has never really been very motherly towards me. I know that she loves me, but she just doesn't show it in anyway. Never the less, she is my mother.)  Later that day my brother, who had been over to pick some things up, drove back to his own flat and I went with him.  Because I didn't had to go anywhere within the next few days and I was able to get back anytime, by train, I didn't see a problem.   Both my parents told me, I am an AH for not telling them and staying away.  I later on called my mother out, for not letting me handle my depression like I need it but she would just call me an Ah and various other mean things.   So, reddit AITA?\n",
      "I ( F 27) am a black women , adopted into an Indian family( important). I was adopted young, as my bio mom didn’t want any children. When someone in my family got married we all went and it was a big party. Beautiful bridal jewelry, dresses, and so many colors, I loved it. Though marriage wasn’t my end goal I knew that when I had my wedding it would be big and colourful. For more important information, my bio mother got in contact with my adopted mom three years go asking to meet me and I did. I slowly allowed her back into my life and though my mom and dad( adopted) didn’t care much for her, they tried their best for me. And that brings us to now.  I am getting married soon and we have been planning for a beautiful wedding. My fiancé and I are very excited and so is my parents. In the early stages I noticed my mom wasn’t feeling a lot of the things we were doing but I tried to keep her involved. “ mom do you want me to teach you how to drape a saree? I think you’d like it” “my clothes are just fine”. I’ve tried so hard to share the culture I grew up with with her but she just seemed so uncomfortable. Before the incident I gifted her some gold earrings from when I went to India years back and I found one on the floor and I don’t know where the other went but I never brought it up since I figured it was an honest mistake. A couple weeks ago me and my mom (adopted) were discussing my wedding dress and bridal jewelry and when I mentioned dress being red my mom cut in. She was confused so I showed her a picture and my mom(adopted)asked what the problem was. Ignoring my mom( adopted) she turns to me and says “ I just always pictured my daughter in white for her wedding not…all this”. I explained to her that it was normal but she continued. She talked down the dress and everything, especially the bridesmaids being too “ flamed up “ and taking the spotlight. I tried suggesting a second small wedding, or even a white wedding shoot just so she can hang it up but she wasn’t having it. My mom said that I needed to stop trying to play dress up. My adopted mom then said she could not come and I gently agreed. My bio mom won’t speak to me now and I feel like a big asshole. I feel if I had educated her better she wouldn’t have been so blind sided. I don’t want her to feel like I’m abandoning her , I just wanted her to be more considerate of the culture I was raised with. I know I can’t ask my parents since they are biased so I’ll ask here. AITA? How could I have handled this differently?\n",
      "Hey guys! This is considerably tame compared to my normal arguments, but I'm not sure if I'm being a petty little shite, so maybe you can clear it up for me.  Four nights ago, I (18F) voluntarily made dinner. It was nothing too big, just spaghetti and garlic bread, but I'd already done dishes once earlier in the day, so after I was done cooking, I asked my old man (59) if he'd take care of the dishes for me, since I made the dinner he'd been pestering mum (54) about for a week. He just kinda laughed and said \"okay, sure\". Later during dinner, he asked if I would make a chocolate cake if he bought the supplies. I said that I would.  It's later that night and the dishes are sitting in the sink. I poke my head out into the garage, which is my dad's apartment. I let him know I've put the rest of the spaghetti in the fridge. He says \"okay\" and goes back to playing his video games. I think nothing of it and go to bed.  The next morning, the dishes are still in the sink. I think, \"oh, he must have forgotten about them\", and I let it go. I remind him later in the evening that he said he'd do the dishes, but he doesn't respond, and the dishes don't get done another night because I'm a donkey and I didn't want to do them when he said he'd do them.  Finally, yesterday I say, \"hey, are you ever going to get around to doing the dishes? We're going to get ants in the sink.\" He laughs at me and says, \"isn't it already clear enough what the answer to that is?\" so basically that means no, he's not going to touch the dishes.  All I said was, \"okay, I'll remember that the next time you want me to cook for you\" and I shut the door. I did the dishes myself last night because he couldn't be arsed to do it.  I get it, okay? I'm the \"child\", so it's my responsibility to do my chores. But I thought he was being serious when he said he would do the dishes for me! So I asked my mum if it would be petty of me to just... Not make the chocolate cake he asked me to make. She asked me if I would eat any of it. I wouldn't, because chocolate makes me sick to my stomach, as do most sweets anymore. Then she said that I should just make the cake, since I promised that I would if he bought the stuff for it, and he did. I don't think it's fair for me to make extra work for myself for someone who can't be bothered to do the dishes one night. I do dishes for the whole house myself the whole week and I never ask for help, but the one night that I did, BECAUSE I COOKED HIM DINNER, he said he would and then he didn't. Maybe this is just me being irrationally angry because he treats us like shit all the time and everything is always about him and what he wants, but I'm fucking fed up with him and I don't want to make his damn cake anymore.  So WIBTA if I just refused to make it since he wouldn't do dishes for me?  Edit: mother of Christ I didn't expect this post to blow up the way it has. Thank you to everyone who's commented and given me advice or ideas. You've no clue how well your support puts me at ease!  Double edit: can you guys do me a favor? Please scroll to the bottom and upvote the comments that are in the negative. Their opinions are just as valid as everyone else's - please don't punish them! Thank you!\n",
      "TL, DR: a family member is complaining that I didn't return something, but refuses to answer or return my calls to make arrangements.  The long version (it isn't about the ladder): A few monthas ago my father was hospitalized with a stroke. I borrowed a ladder (he has 4) to work on a project, and showed him project pictures every time I visited.  In the meantime, I was helping his wife, driving 40 miles each way to help with online bill pay, gardening, picking up meds, resetting (and moving) the router, etc. I helped her program the GPS, researched all the rehabs, and talked her through some issues.   She now claims I tried to take over and control her life, said I told people she has alzheimers, tried to move furniture while she wasn't there (I said we had to wait for her to be home to give instructions) and said that I talked over her when dealing with doctors (my recordings prove I asked if she had any more questions before I asked mine). I'm not sure what she told her family, except they're making statements on Facebook how they won't tolerate how the other family (us) is treating her. She prides herself on being honest yet has told me she lied to me and is doing it again.   I apologized several times for all the things I didn't do, and told her I only wanted to help. She stopped all communication with us for a month. Now she only talks to my brothers (I was the only one ever close to her), and tells them she needs me to return the ladder \"for when dad gets home and can use it again.\" Dad has almost no use of his right half, and will likely not walk again, much less climb ladders. So now she needs it to get paper towels down from a shelf. (Nevermind those other 4 ladders). For the record, he is still in rehab and spent 4 days of the past 4.5 months home. She sent him back and claimed he was aggressive towards her and has been aggressive/ controlling for 25 years (which no one else has ever seen).  My brother makes it sound like ITA for not bringing it back, but when I reply to him he says he's just telling me, he refuses to get into the drama. I've called her 9x in the past month, and texted her with no reply. She changed the garage code so I can't just leave it inside.   I'm willing to leave a message that I'll deliver the ladder as soon as she lets me know when she'll be available. Until then, I don't plan on going. Please let me know, AITA?\n",
      "This is a special addition called AIAB (Am I A Baby?) just reply as per usual, use the usual NTA or YTA and I’ll understand (:  I work a government job as a casual employee. I have worked at this job for 5 months. When I was hired they were aware that I had a second job. They harress me AT LEAST DAILY to come into work on days off. Even if I say in advance I cannot work and do not call me because I’m at my other job, I’ll get left voice mails saying I have to call them back ASAP to let them know if I can work. Often I don’t because I don’t see the message until hours later, which leads to the employer being upset that I didn’t answer my phone.  I’d say about every second pay they accidentally underpay me. This pay I was not paid for 2 days of work, and because it’s my last pay before Christmas I was upset. When I asked my boss to fix it she was happy to. I asked if I would get that money before Christmas and she said  “Well if you wanted Christmas money you should’ve picked up more hours”.   This infuriated me as I DID but I DIDNT GET PAID. She then went on to say I should work more like another girl who worked 15 days in a row (the shifts are only 4 hours so in order to make any money most people have to do that)   I have a partner who works out of town, so when he has a day off I obviously take that day off too.   Last night after my other job at 730 I got a call from government job. The supervisor said I had been put on a shift for 6am the next day and if I had been told. I informed her I had not and tomorrow was my only day off and my only day off with my man.  “I did tell (higher ups name) that she should call you earlier but she said you’d get the text auto accepting that shift and you’d figure it out. I’m sorry”  I agreed to work it but I honestly feel bullied into working more than I can. And to make me work so early at such short notice without telling me seems rude. Idk what to do because it’s a new job, I’m casual, she’s high up and I want to look good because I’m hoping to move to another less shitty department eventually.   Help? Advice? Am I being a baby?\n",
      "TLDR: Casually talking to my mum and then it came up in conversation that my teacher takes random pictures of the class and sends them to other parties, mum said she wasn't happy about it and is going to call the school.  So in my science class at school, we have this teacher who is always on her phone (which is against the school rules even for teachers) and always takes pictures and sends them to her boyfriend and 'friends'. Some back story between me and this teacher, she doesn't like me very much and always puts me on detention, even when I don't do anything wrong.   At the time the pictures were taken I didn't feel comfortable and I still don't when she's on her phone during lesson, but didn't tell anyone about it until now.

      "Burner account for obvious reasons.  This is a weird situation and I'm not sure how to really fully parse through it. So I seek the judgement of strangers on the internet to tell me if I'm wrong.  To make a painfully long story short, I am a 19 year old trans masc furry. If you know much about furries, it's that furries like to get art done of their sonas. I reached out to an artist I liked for a comm and she was pretty nice. Her prices were fair, she was pretty nice, and she seemed to really like my sona.  The commission was a full body digital drawing, she was charging 90 bucks, a decently fair price given her skill. Her price structure was half up front, then half upon completion of the art. All was fine, and she even said since she liked the character, she'd probably share some concept sketches free of charge since my sona seemed fun to draw.  This is where things got... awkward. She sent me some rough sketches and the first thing I noticed was tits. On my sona's ref I did include the fact they wear a binder instead of having had top surgery (accurate to me) but it's also SUPER clear they're a trans dude. Yet in half of these rough sketches, my sona was wearing a pair of panties and no top. Only one of the sketches were suggestive, but it involved my sona touching their breasts and... yeah, wasn't a fan of that. Especially since my commission was SFW.  I ask the artist about this and she's pretty casual about it, saying she just wanted to test out and get a feel for the character and remarked that \"she's so cute.\" I remind the artist my sona is trans and she's pretty jokey but her joking is \"no need to waste a cute girl\" and \"men are trash anyways lol\" and \"best boobs I've seen on a 'man' before\"  At this point I'm pretty uncomfortable and tell the artist that I'm done with this. She can keep the money I paid up front but I don't want her to work on the rest of the comm. I then blocked her because I don't need that shit and moved on.  Flash forward a few weeks and now people (including some of my friends) are messaging me about paying for the comm. Turns out she finished it anyways since \"she never agreed to the cancel and had already started.\"Now some people are calling me a thief and a jerk, but am I really the ass here for not being comfortable with this?  &#x200B;  EDIT: I thought this was clear, but some people seem a bit confused so just to make it super clear. The sketches weren't the commission, at the time of me cancelling, if she had started the actual commission, I had not seen it. Apparently though she did finish it after I cancelled and blocked her.  But I haven't seen it since \"I'll get it when I pay what I owe.\"\n",
      "To clarify, I'm currently in high school with diagnosed anxiety, depression and BPD. I am aware that everyone deals with their mental health in different ways and that people express their difficulties differently.   But I have one particular girl in my immediate group of friends who to me seems very clueless about how common mental struggles are. In the past when me and another friend had told her about some of our friends and ourselves and the extent of their/our mental health issues, she was very surprised and said she \"had no idea\".   She often goes on various rants at school about how bad her mental state is and doesn't seem to have very much regard for how it sounds to myself and others who are struggling. While I do not think someones struggles should be belittled at all I find it extremely grating when she says things like \"I need to take a mental health day on Friday\" because she has had an increase in her workload. Just the other day she said she felt deliriously happy despite the fact that she had been having a rather rough week. She said she felt like she \"was in a depressive episode but was currently experiencing a 'happy depression'\" which really pissed me off.   She has done similar things for majority of the year, AITA?\n",
      "Me (me obviously F, 29) K (31, f, best friend)  My best friend and I are at logger heads as to who's the asshole, her for wanting me to stay at her house when she knows I clearly dont like her boyfriend but who's gonna be there or me, here is our reasoning below  Me: I feel like hes gaslighting  her. Hes told her that shes hearing voices as a joke and he didnt listen to her family members when they told him she had a serious mental health condition. Hes not taking her seriously  when shes expressing concerns over her mental health. The guys an alcoholic. All she tells me is negative  things. She just tells me she loves him. I want her to tell me positive things about him so I can actually  be in the house with him. I just feel that she hasn't given me any reasons as to why I should like him, only reasons to not like him.  K: I'm in a relationship  with my bf. We moved in together 6 weeks ago. Hes not perfect (his own words). Just the other day I realised that he is dependent  on  alcohol which is obviously  a problem. But I care for this guy, he makes me happy... when hes not driving me up the wall. I live with him. I love him. Yes I vent to my friends when hes being a dick. Do I think this relationship  is the one? I'm not sure, but he has potential. I care a lot about him and can see myself spending the rest of my life with him. My point is, I live with him. I want my best mate to visit. I feel like she should come and spend some time with us. It's not all bad or I wouldn't be with him. I want my best mate and  bf to get on. Yes I have mental health  issues, yes he doesn't take it as seriously  as  he should but my point is my best mate shouldn't not  want to come to my house because of shit with my bf that she hast even met yet.  Who's the arsehole? K or me?\n",
      "This happened a while ago, I work at a local pizza place, and it was dinner rush. I manage the phone, counter, and oven because we were understaffed   During rush a lady comes in and orders food, I get everything ready and ask if she wants a bag, she says no. I tell her the usual thank you for coming have a nice night.  I then go to answer the ringing phone to place them on hold so I can service the next person at the counter when she yells out ‘actually can I have a bag?’ Because everyone else is busy getting deliveries or making pizza I grab a bag, open it, and hand it to her over the counter where she’s standing. The store has one of those high glass protection counters, like subway, and she was at the end of it so I just jumped to give it to her when she didn’t move down towards the register.   I again tell her to have a nice night and enjoy her food, when she just stops, stares at me and beings yelling at me telling me I could of come around and placed the food she was holding into the bag, she immediately walked out cursing under her breath, all my coworkers and customers in the store just kind of stopped and looked at her because we were all in shock.   I then go and take the order of the people on hold and the counter when another call comes in, it’s someone requesting to talk to the manager because ‘she received the worse customer service she’s ever had and she will never come back, and she’s been coming here for years and has never come across someone like me with such an attitude, and that I need to be reprimanded by someone’ my manager just gave her a ‘yes, I am sorry and will talk talk to her about it’ I didn’t get reprimanded, everyone just kind of laughed it off, I’m only asking because when I told my mom she said it was rude of me to not walk around and put the ladies food into the bag.\n",
      "New Profile didn’t want it connected to my main.  So this happened about an hour ago, so about a month ago me 15F and my friend I’ll call JJ 17F meet this kid we’ll go with Daniel 7M on Fortnite.  at first, he didn’t have a mic but me and JJ loved his name and he was pretty good at the game, so we played several games with him and from that point, we started playing with him more. soon after he got a mic and we learned he was 7 witch was a relief because we honestly thought he was probably a 40-year-old.  Now earlier me JJ and him were playing squads and as soon as Daniel started talking the random guy we were playing with started cussing him out (he sounded around the age of 20) I told Daniel to mute him, which he did, once me and JJ started standing up for him he started calling us weird for playing with a 7-year-old.  then for the entire match called us stuff like sl ts h es and asking how many abortions we’ve got and to shut up and put a d**k in our mouths and so on but he continued with the us playing with a 7 year old thing.  and it got me thinking if it’s a bad thing that we’ve been playing with Daniel, his a sweet kid and a lot of fun to play with but if we’re doing something wrong by playing with him then I’ll feel really bad and I don’t want to get him or me and JJ into any sort of trouble.   We should have left the match as soon as the guy started cussing and saying those things for Daniels's sake, I regret us not doing that but it’s didn’t come across my mind at the time especially since Daniel had him muted and couldn’t hear anything that was being said.  Sorry for any bad wording or grammar I’m dyslexic and not very good with writing long messages like this.  So AITA for playing with Daniel?\n",
      "The incident happened Friday night, but I'm going to pre face this by telling how I ended up at this jam session. I dont post much on reddit, so I will try to format for easy reading.  A couple months back I was letting my son play at a church playground. When we pulled in I noticed a older gentleman sitting on the bench, but I thought nothing of it since service didnt start for a couple more hours.  This man and I had been talking for awhile and we get on the subject of playing guitar. I tell him that I'm self taught and would like to find a group to listen to / follow along with to learn. He tells me about a little get together they have on friday nights at a church, encourages me to come check it out and to bring along my family.  Fast forward to this Friday and I'm hyped about it. I walk in with my wife and child and I start to feel like maybe we are a little out of place. There was about 10 -15 people there with instruments and around 30 more people in the crowd. All of the guitars looked almost identical, with blonde tybe bodies and here I am with a midnight edition esteban I had gotten from my mamaw when my papaw passed away.  I sat down on the seats lining the wall near a couple other pickers and they introduced themselves. I explained how I don't feel I'm a very strong guitar player and that I was just there to try and follow along. That's when they asked a question I hadn't prepared for,  \"Well, Do you sing? \"  I laughed it off and began to loosen up and the man asked again overvthe mic after he led a song. He said, \" Your a new picker in here with us, I'd really like for you to sing us a song and Jeff and I will play with you! \" I stood up and asked if they knew the song Wagon Wheel from Old Crow Medicine Show and they began to smile and gesture me towards them.   Now Reddit, I only sing when I play because none of my friends I usually play with will. I definitely had never sung at a function like this but I was feeling great because I have practiced this song alot.  I'm up there and i start singing a little out of time but by the end of the first verse  me and these two fellas are getting it together. I'm staring kind of cross eyed at the mic to keep from looking at the crowd but I can see a few in the front swaying back and forth and I can hear them clapping. We finish the song and when I sat back down the man I was sitting beside told me thats something I should do more often.  I was feeling great about myself and my guitar playing until we left, and this isvthe part that makes me feel like an asshole, my wife mentions that when I got done an older woman made the comment that was NOT the type of place for that song and a man beside of her asked her what was so bad about it .  Am I the asshole ?  My son is wanting to go again next week but I'm really having second thoughts about it. I'm sorry this is a long post . ask questions if you want, ill answer!\n",
      "Throwaway account because I'm pretty sure my roommate knows my Reddit username.  I (M25) moved in with a friend of mine (M25) a little over half a year ago and things were going real well, for a while. I'll admit I'm not the cleanest person on earth but I was making a sincere effort to keep the common areas clean since our apartment was nice, and he had requested it. Originally our understanding was that the apartment was clean before we went to bed for the night and / or one of us was having people over. I wasn't perfect but over time he became more frustrated with us sticking to the plan, soon requesting that the common areas be completely clean whenever he and I were done with them. This was frustrating to me especially since both of us are working remotely so sometimes things come up, and I had just started grad school, but over time came to adopt this. However soon he became angry if I would leave something out when I would use the restroom and come right back. And then again when I would go to use the shower and leave my bag or coat on the couch before work.  His response was always heavily hostile or rude, going directly to, \"clean your fucking dishes,\" or \"what the fuck is wrong with you.\" An example is when I walked in to the common area and saw him said hello and started putting my groceries in the fridge not noticing his headphones. He then screams at me saying \"I can't fucking hear you don't talk to me when I'm on a work call.\"  This came to a head yesterday when he yelled at me again for leaving a singular hat on a table despite me sitting next to it. I told him that it was unessesary for him to be so disrespectful to me at every step. His response was to tell me that I am annoying and when asked why that was enough reason to be so rude to me he said it wasn't. But to make his point he told me he has every right to do so since his job is more difficult and that he works more hours. He then makes fun of my mental illness, and despite now following exactly his rules on cleaning the apartment, the fact that he ever had to ask for me to do any sort of cleaning ever was enough reason for him to curse at me.  I honestly don't know what to do at this point because litteraly existing in the same room as him results in him being absolutely hostile, often without cause.  Reddit AITA?  *Edit: Added age and gender\n",
      "So a little bit of context. Me and my girlfriend made up the deal that i will go with her to her first festival last oktober. And our motto back then was when 1 cant, the other shouldnt go too.  Now back to present: In September there is an den upcoming Festival. The only problem is that you need to get an invitation code through your uni. Its randomized.  She got one and i did not. She said she still will go and i was really sad about it.  Today the topic came back up and i just started crying because lately she doesnt care anymore if i am there or not. She even said\"i dont care if you are there,  just anybody(from our friendgroup) is fine.\"  Now she is mad at me because i destroy peace in the house and i should just be happy for her that she can go. I got mad, because i already tried to hide my tears and she still blames me for ruining the peace.  So Am i the asshole?  (Sorry for typos)\n",
      "I’ve been wanting a desk for a while, I have a job and can buy it myself but my mom kept on insisting she was going to get me one so I waited for her. She showed up with a pretty desk but it was brown and it would clash with the decorations of my room, all of my furniture is grey. I didn’t want it but I took it either way because I didn’t want to seem ungrateful. Later on the day my mom told me she found it on a curb and it was free, so because she didn’t spend any money on it I said “oh then we can put it in the spare bedroom since it wouldn’t look good in my room and I can just buy myself one” she didn’t say anything but just nodded her head. At the time my cousin was staying in the spare bedroom. He thanked my mom for giving him the desk while he stayed with us and my mom seemed very happy by him thanking her. That night my mom and my cousin got a bit drunk and started catching up, while my cousin went to the bathroom she looked at me and started saying how ungrateful I am and she wishes I could be different. She said she wished I could be more appreciative like my cousin. That genuinely hurt me so I went to my room and cried. If my mom would’ve spend money on the desk I wouldn’t have cared that it didn’t go with my room at all and would’ve kept it, but because she got it for free I thought it was okay to not want it. Am I really that ungrateful for it?\n",
      "I (29F) live with my BD (32M), he's been back living with me for 2 months now, we recently had a baby so I was okay with him being at home not working. Well the last 2 months these are things he doesn't like to do. He doesn't like to clean, he see's my dad as a maid because he lives with me rent free which he also lives rent free. He wont cook for himself but he will gladly eat the food I cook or he will just go out and buy food with the money he doesn't have. He also leaves his trash everywhere and dishes to I pick up after him or my father does. He also sleep a lot and games a lot, I am the one watching the baby and giving her attention almost all the time. It got to the point that I had to let the baby cry to annoy him to help because I needed sleep. So we are entering July and he still has no job and he has no money. For June he did help pay bills but it wasn't even half the bills because he believes he shouldn't have to since he has to pay his car stuff. I don't drive so we do use his car but we use it to get groceries which I pay for and stuff for the baby which we both pay for. So I told him not in a nice way but can't blame me I'm really frustrated, but I told him to go do something, that he needs to go work or go back home to his parents. I said I was tired of seeing him do nothing at home and also we need money to pay the bills. I do get some money because of my job but I'm using my savings and that money to pay for bills until I go back to work in August. I can handle the not working but I'm so tired of him not doing anything, but at the same time is it my place to tell him to do something. So AITA?  -forgot to put this my BD isn’t mean, he’s funny, sexual in a good way, and treats my first kid as if she was his and also treats the baby well too he just doesn’t like that she’s needs attention 24/7. He doesn’t tell me what to do or how to do it that’s usually me telling him. He’s very lazy and only wants to do what he wants. Also I am scared to kick him out since he does have rights as a father and does want to take the baby with him.\n",
      "I’ll try and make this as quick as I can. I work as a paid volunteer at a school. I work first in the cafeteria, then I do assistance in the yard and after that I do after school with the kids. They are all from 10 to 13 years old, the ones I work with are all 10. I smoke, so sometimes I go out to smoke a cigarette quickly. When I’m not out I don’t stay in the fields, I stay below the shed with another coworker of mine. A few weeks ago we didn’t go to to the yard, we stayed in class instead because it was raining. While the kids were doing their break, I asked my coworker to stay with my kids while I went to take a quick break. While I was downstairs smoking, another coworker of mine asked her where I was and she said I went downstairs a few minutes ago. He said “I have to talk to her, that’s not fair”, she answered that she didn’t mind, but he reinforced his opinion. He never talked to me, but I’m 99% sure he kept talking bad about me behind my back. So I went to talk to him and asked him what was the problem with me and why he couldn’t say it to my face, and he said that he was annoyed that he was always alone in the fields with the kids. (For some context: the other day two kids beat each other up and I was outside smoking, no one was there to stop them). I told him he was right and that I would do better, but that he should have said so to my face. He said he didn’t think he would have to because he knows I’m smart, so he basically called me stupid. Anyway, discussion ended on a somewhat good note and he said “I hope we’ll do better from now on”. Since that conversation I started helping him in the fields and I always stay there.  Now for the other issue, there’s another coworker of mine and the vice director of the school put me in class with her since my students behave badly all the time. She decided that we should make 4 classes study together, and it’s been hell ever since. There’s always a lot of noise and no one manages to study everything and better. Plus, she constantly asks where I am, I can’t even go to the bathroom without her asking about me, and she says I disappear all the time. Yesterday she went to complain about me to the vice director. I figured it out so I went to talk to him. He basically told me I’m always chatting on the phone (not true but okay, I only take it when it’s urgent) and that I deserve kids being noisy because I don’t make them respect me. He then said that not everyone’s cut out for this job and that if that’s the case with me they’ll find someone else. He also told me I can’t take a break at work because we don’t get one. I work 4 Hours a day and I put my heart and soul in this job because I love the kids and I really like it, and I have to listen to this? It’s not worth it, I’m just so tired. I’m already going through a really awful period and I also have to deal with this… I don’t have the patience nor the energy. I don’t get where did I go wrong. AITA?\n",
      "I (28F) am a single mother to two children, (6M) and (4F), They each have a wall in their rooms that is painted white and they're allowed to draw on that wall and only that wall, after a month I repaint it to cover it up and give them a fresh canvas to draw on I figured it's harmless and fun for them and channels their creativity while saving the rest of my walls.   My Ex Partner (29M) isn't really involved but his Mother has taken to visiting wanting to know her grandchildren and be part of their lives, she knows about the walls and has been telling me recently how it's ridiculous that I allow this and i'm teaching them bad habits as well as wasting money with repainting the wall. She has been questioning a lot of my Mothering because of this also and implied that i'm doing a bad job of raising them.  I am honestly upset by this as I thought doing this was harmless and fun for my children as they are very aware they can't do this anywhere else, i've told her I don't want her coming round for a while which she didn't take well and honestly i'm considering not allowing her to come back round as I cannot take her picking at how i'm raising my children when her own son cannot be arsed having anything to do with them.  Before anyone worries here Grandparents do not have an automatic legal right to have contact with their Grandchild in my Country so i'd be doing nothing legally wrong with this. I just feel bad for considering this but I have reached a breaking point. AITA for this?\n",
      "We live in a house and we rent rooms. I (24f) share the house with Alexa (23f), Brit (21f), Mark (21M) and Paul (22M).  Last year, we had already troubles with Brit (P,M&A are new this year). She's a mess and also her boyfriend, who stays over like 6 times a week. Now Mark and Paul are two big pigs too and won't clean either.  Alexa and I have teamed and we share our own kitchen stuff. We have a key of each other's rooms.  This has been an issue and after A LOT of long talks we have given up. I'm not asking for a spotless house, I'm just asking for BASIC stuff to be done, like brooming onion rests of the floor, not leaving the counter full of pepper seeds and tomato, not leaving the things in the sink for over a week...Having a plate available when I go to make dinner...  They say 'they are studying' but I, and Alexa, study, work part-time jobs and do a lot of stuff and STILL clean after ourselves.  Recently I've purchased a Roomba(R) for my room and I let Alexa use it.  We use it in the common areas only when we are at home so we can take it back to my room when it finishes. The R stays in my room. I've not given permission to anyone besides Alexa to touch it.  Last Sunday I was cleaning after breakfast and since the kitchen floor looked like a DIRTY PUB'S floor.I put the R on. My phone notifies me when the R is done. I was starting to get suspicious because it was taking way too long.  I went downstairs and the R noise was coming from Mark's room.  I open the door and find MY R there.I was super mad because Mark and I can't see each other. He's the piggest of them all and we don't even say Hi to each other.  He knows it's mine and he doesn't have permission also it's expensive and his room is a mess and it can damage my R by letting it get caught in his dirty socks and stuff. So I stormed inside and I got my R. He started yelling at me to get out that I was violating his space. I told him if he ever again touches my stuff I'm going to do the same.  He called me crazy and said it was just a robot. I told him it was MY ROBOT and that for someone who doesn't give two fucks about cleaning it was funny he decided to grab it and bring it into his PIGPEN. Brit came and told me I was over reacting.  I told them I'm sick of them and I'm talking to the landlord about how they treat the house and the common areas.  UPDATE:  (WE ARE NOT IN THE US)Alexa and I CALLED  the landlord and he came. We showed him everything and he was shocked. He told us, he's talking to them and if we find 3 other people to fill their rooms, he would break the contract. That is legal, since we have a 'Bedroom contract' and since we pay monthly that means, any part can end the contract at the end of any month. That's great bc we really love the house and it's affordable. So Alexa and I have started to look for people to see if we can get them to move in during April (we don't want to be mean and have the other three kicked with 2 days notice and we want to take time to find people that suit us). He told us he's doing this bc he, reformed the house and it's a family one and he knows Alexa and I take care of everything and we deep cleaned an old patio in September and we made it look nice and clean. So he knows, his family house is in better hands with us.  UPDATE 2: Landlord told them they have until the last day of match to live here and Brit went crazy on ME saying I was the drama. I told her I’d rather be the drama than a pig with no consideration. Alexa and I are looking for new roomies ☺️\n",
      "So my bf(25m) and I(22f) have literally only been officially dating since October 1 of this year. Super super new. We have a long 7 year history that’s a little weird and convoluted. Main points are: •his ex gf was my BFF for like 5 years •two of my ex bfs slept w his ex gf •one of my exes and his ex gf are currently missing people on the street homeless and they just had a baby that her parents are taking care of  •everyone in this story is a current addict except me. I am in recovery There’s a ton more but I just wanted to express that we really do have a long history, and I know he’s having a difficult time rn. He has been talking about going to treatment and I obviously have been very supportive. We hung out about a week ago and we had a great time for about an hour. Then, he told me to pull over in a sketchy area. Whatever. I know he’s using. Said he needed to see someone. Fine. Then he starts to use my drug of choice in front of me. I was livid. I dropped his shit out of my car and left him there. He never called or texted to apologize.  He is saying that I never explicitly stated he couldn’t use in front of me and that he isn’t a mind reader. I think it’s common sense. He knows I’m in recovery and won’t stay if he doesn’t get into a facility. He also started saying he wouldn’t go to treatment and a bunch of other stuff. I’m starting to really rethink this whole relationship as I read it all written out honestly. I like him but it’s too much.  But was I an asshole for leaving him there and expecting him to know that he couldn’t use in front of me when I never specifically said anything? TLDR: I’m a recovering addict, my new bf used in front of me, I skrted out of there and left him.  ETA: I’m going to cut it off. This isn’t healthy at all and I guess I needed to hear someone else say it who has no skin in the game. I will admit I’m a bit lonely and like the affection and attention from him, but I’m unwilling to allow someone to come before my safety and recovery. My plan is(because it is such a new relationship) just to stop responding to him and pray for him to find help and go to treatment. He knows how to do it. We don’t talk all day every day anyway so that shouldn’t be too hard. Officially having a “breakup talk” will probably be nothing but detrimental to both of us. Thank you all.\n",
      "My university has gone fully online so I've been spending this past semester with my parents and sister at home. It's been pretty difficult since I haven't lived with my parents in a long time. I don't feel like I have a lot of freedom here and there's not much to do. We used to fight a lot since being around each other 24/7 is stressful and because my parents weren't okay with me going to to my uni city for the next semester.   Recently though, they changed their mind and I'm going back very soon. Things have gotten a lot better in my relationship with them and now I feel bad.   I mainly feel bad that I was such a shit for the first months I was here and now I don't have the time to make it up and moreso, that I'm leaving my sister behind. My parents are overall fine, but they can be hyper critical and she doesn't have anyone here to hang out with but me. I genuinely feel an intense need to leave but I'm feeling like an asshole because I'm leaving her alone so I can be a little bit happier. I'm fighting to have her come with me, but it's to no avail so far because even me leaving is still upsetting to them because they're so worried about COVID.   It's just been weighing on me and every time I talk to friends about this they console my worries and tell me I need to do this for myself, but that's clearly biased and I'd like to hear more people's opinions.\n",
      "i (16) live with my brother, (3) and mother (36). during the days, i watch my brother while she can sleep due to her working night shifts. the other day, she went to get her hair done and other things which i had no problem with. when she got back, i made her food and she went up to put my brother down for a nap. when he woke up, i brought him into the living room so my mom could sleep. i watched him for about 7 hours before she woke up. (i tried waking her 4 times, did not work)  i was emotionally drained, and i texted my brothers father to facetime so that i could eat. now, my brothers father is a deadbeat. he’s an alcoholic and overall a horrible person. i won’t disclose specifics, but i am uncomfortable around him. the two were on facetime for 20 minutes.  she eventually woke up and asked me why she heard his dads voice, i said “i let them facetime so i could eat and have a break” she blew up and started screaming. telling me how she has been trying to isolate them from each other but never told me. she gave me dirty looks all night.  fast forward to today, my brother went into my room. i have my uniform which is at least 700$ to replace if ruined on my bed. he got too close, so i corrected him and then he didn’t listen so i picked him up and took him out and locked my door from the inside. he started crying and throwing a fit to which she told me “what is wrong with you? you’re f*cking traumatizing him. do you have fun torturing him? you’re a sociopath.” i told her i didn’t want him to destroy the uniform, it’s expensive and she went on about how i don’t really care about her and how much she would have to spend to replace the uniform.  we have this tea shop that we go to every week, and we went and he started throwing a tantrum as we left. she looked at me and said “thank you, for letting him call with his dad” in a sarcastic tone before slamming the door and glaring at me the entire drive back. she kept bringing up the fact i let the two call and wanted to know every single detail down to the facial expressions. as well saying me being uncomfortable around his father is invalid now because of my actions.  aita? i understand i shouldn’t have let the two call but i don’t feel the reaction and the things she’s saying as a result are appropriate for the action.\n",
      "My bf is pretty confident in his height (5’3) and never really mentioned it.  So I wanted to kinda dig and see what he really thinks about it. So I set up a convo which led to this topic and told him I have always dreamt of a tall boyfriend because I love tall men.   He was bothered beyond belief and he turned serious and told me this is like dating a black chick and telling her how you always dreamt of dating a girl with a pale fair skin, and that it’s super disrespectful.  He left and hasn’t returned my calls at all since yesterday.  Did I fuck up reddit?\n",
      "I work in housekeeping, I do turndown service at night. I’ve been having trouble with a coworker who has made passive aggressive, rude remarks to me, but I can handle that.   What I’m upset about is she used my housekeeping cart one day and left it TOTALLY trashed which took time out of my turndown to clean. All the housekeepers have been told to clean their carts at the end of the day, but she didn’t do it.   Would I be the asshole if I talked to my manager about what she’s doing? I want to bring it up if she does it again.\n",
      "This happened today.  Me and my significant other have been living with my mother for the last 4 months due to not having enough money to get a place or our own.  Thing lately have been getting heated with my mother as we constantly argue and because of this the relationship between us and her has deteriorated.  She wants us out of the house, and so do we. We have just enough money to rent a place.  We haven't been lucky in getting apartment viewings, many people haven't returned our calls, and due to my SOs job we also have a pretty tight schedule when we can arrange a viewing.  Today my mother came into our room shortly after I had woken up, she showed me an ad for an apartment and told me she's going to contact the person to arrange a viewing. Just to note, my SO is at work and won't be home till late at night.  I don't mind this, as I assumed she would arrange the viewing on a day that me and my SO would be available together. A short while later she returned and told me that she set up a meeting for today and that she would go with me.  I quickly got ready, got into the car and sent my SO a message that I'm going to check out an apartment for us with my mother.  I got there, the appartment looked like crackhouse, so after some small talk with the owner I left. I sent my SO a video of the apartment which I took to show her what it looked like. My mother was also there checking the place out with me.  When we got back into the car my SO messaged me she was a bit angry that I viewed an apartment without her or her knowledge and especially angry that I went with my mother.  I tried explaining that she arranged the viewing 45 minutes before we had to be there and that I was also unaware of her making this appointment so soon and without the presence of my SO.  We had a fight that lasted pretty much till now about  the whole thing. I personally do not feel as this is any big deal, as I wouldn't mind her checking out an apartment without me present, due to work or whatever else. I also didn't think she would get angry at all for me viewing the apartment without her, much less because it was last minute and I didn't have much planning to do. I believe her reaction was way out of proportion for something that isn't a big deal, as I just viewed the apartment and wouldn't make any decision that wasn't mutual.  We're writing this together and she will put some of her input / perspective now.  She feels very left out, as this isn't the first time that I had a serious talk with my mother, regarding my and therefore also my SOs future, without her presence. She doesn't like my mother being a part of our decisions. What really set her off today was that she was absolutely unaware of the viewing my mother scheduled and her also accompanying me to the viewing.  So that's it.  Who's the asshole?\n",
      "I (26F) has a cousin, Maria(10F) and she's currently in a relationship with a boy from her class. Personally I don't think she should be dating at that age but she's not my child and it's not my job to parent her. However I'm very close with Maria and she idolizes me as well as my relationship with my fiance so she often comes over to discuss the \"girly things\". My aunt, Maria's mother came over with Maria today to discuss \"relationship issues\". I almost couldn't hold a straight face as they were talking.  Maria's problem:  \"Her boyfriend,  Jake has been flirting with another girl in their class for the last week.\"  In Maria's class they are currently working on a project, a  group  project. Jake and Maria are not in the same group but Jake is in a group with three people. Half of the assignment is being done by Jake and \"the  mystery  girl\" and half of it is being done by his other two group mates. Jake is NOT flirting with the \" mystery  girl\", during the project work periods in the week, he's working on the project with \"the  mystery  girl\". To sum it all up, Maria thinks he's trying to cheat because he's actually communicating with the person he's doing a project with.  To me that's hilarious, I mean if they were adults and Maria was jealous over that, it would be a major red flag and a sign they should split up. However considering their ages, it's more like that's really the only think she has to be jealous of.  Here's where I may be the asshole:  Upon realizing what the problem was, I quickly gave Maria some advice. I told her to just focus on the her own project for now because the project is going to be finished soon anyways and he won't be \"flirting\" for much longer. Then I excused myself to the kitchen and started laughing, like I really let loose just not enough to be heard from where Maria and my Aunt were. Then I started contemplating if I was like that with my crushes at 10 and laughed some more. And then, my aunt walked in. She was angry at me, she went to the bathroom and heard me laughing about the problem. She told me I was the asshole for not taking Maria's problem seriously and laughing behind her back. Essentially I'm a bad cousin and she hopes Maria doesn't grow up to be like me. After a small goodbye they left. My fiance thinks that I'm not the asshole, but my friend group is pretty split. AITA?\n",
      "Right now I'm very focused on finishing the 14ers, 14,000ft or higher in Colorado. I had done 45 out of the 52-58 (depending on who you ask) and I'm determined to finish them this year.  My sister is a medium-skilled hiker who has done 8 with me. We had plans for two weeks ago to godoCapitol, which has a reputation. I've already done the Little Bear/Blanca/Ellingwood, so. I'm prepared.  We sorted out plans and met up the day before to leave. She pulls up to my house and rolls out her fucking kids. They're great, 8 and 10, but no fucking way am I bringing them! They've done Handies, Red Cloud, Sunshine, and San Luis, all very easy. They've never done anything requiring skill and agility.  I ask her if they're being picked up, but she says no, she thought they could come too since it's a \"short hike\" and I look at her like are you fucking kidding me? We get into my car and talk and I'm like \"What the fuck are you thinking? I am not bringing them on our hike. We made plans for the two of us. I packed for the two of us. I prepared mentally and physically for us.\"  \"I picked out a different hike and some camping spots already that we can do instead this time.\" Fucking Quandary. I've done it 15 times. I just said fuck no.  We went back and forth, I'm such a bad aunt, why don't I get how hard it is for a single mom to be cooped up with crazy summer kids, etc etc. I ended up telling her that like it or not, I'm leaving in 25 minutes for the campsite, and her kids are not coming. So she'd better send them home, or go home with them. She got so angry that she legit refused to get out of the car and ordered her kids to get in.  So I just grabbed my shit and put it in my husband's car, texted him to let him know (he has spare keys), and said so long and fuck you to my sister. I was PISSED!!! I drove about 2 miles and pulled over so I could chill out and see if she would apologize and text me. 30 minutes past and she just flooded me with angry emojis/rants about how I don't love my nephew/niece and it's like... no, idiot! I do love them! That's why I don't want to take them on that knife's edge! (Please, Google it! Capitol Knife Edge!)  Anyway I said fuck it and took off, she got so mad and twisted the story for Insta/FB and when I got back from Capitol, I had so much anger and hate flooding my inboxes. It was pathetic. I told her to fuck off, I'm giving her a three-month break, kiss the kids for me, but what she tried to pull was ridiculous.  My family is split and some of them think I left a single mom in the dust. She just wanted to spend time with her kids and family having a fun time and camping, I could have done Capitol any time, memories with the kids are forever. I'm like... fuck you, memories of climbing Capitol are forever, too, and the weather was perfect.  But IDK. Some people are more reasonable than others about it and suggest she's really struggling so I should take pity, but I'm not sure why my plans had to suffer for her mistakes. AITA?  ETA: Thanks, everyone! I recognize I'm definitely not the asshole here, and that people just aren't used to someone pushing back on my sister's trying to make her kids be your problem to deal with. I really appreciate it, Reddit.\n",
      "For as long as I can remember, my boyfriend has always been a very egotistical, competitive person. I’m 23 and he’s 22  It’s actually gotten to the point that I hate playing any type of game with him because he absolutely loses his shit when I beat him claiming that I cheated and the game is a load of “bullshit”  He absolutely refuses to admit that I’m better than him at something and goes out of his way to prove that he is in fact better. If he fails, he goes in a strop saying that it’s “fucking shit anyway”   He is normally a very sweet, caring person but this is the one thing I have an issue with.  Well, a couple of days ago he was playing Red Dead Redemption 2 Online with friends, and as always he wanted to compete. So he challenged his friends that whoever finds a 3 star pelt first wins.  I’m sat next to him not really paying attention because i didn’t really understand what they were competing for and was just sat on my phone.   Well, the next thing I know is that he shoots you from his seat, throws his controller on the couch and shouts that his friend is a “fucking c*nt”   I try to start calming him down but it wasn’t really working and I eventually told him that he needs to get over himself.  His friends must of heard me say that because I hear his friends laughing at him through the mic.  A couple of hours go by and he finishes playing with his friends. He turns to me and starts berating me about how I embarrassed him and how his friends kept repeating that he needed to get over himself and that I shouldn’t of said anything.  Now he’s ignoring me and when he does talk to me, it’s in one word answers.  Was it an asshole move of me to tell him to get over himself? Especially since his friends heard me say it\n",
      "I described my issues with Catholicism here. Here's another related conflict.  As I noted there I'm not only not a practicing Catholic, I don't view myself as a Catholic at all, not some sort of \"cultural Catholic\". In fact I view myself as having never truly been Catholic in the first place, like being transgender. It's not even just disagreeing with their politics or even being about 50/50 on if I even believe in God, it just feels  wrong  to be in a Catholic church and frankly I'd still be about as comfortable at mass than I would be at a mosque, something I don't feel at other Christian churches.  I don't like that I was confirmed at an age too young to make a commitment. My mom agreed to both remove me from the family list registered with the church and never ask me to attend mass again, meaning we did not attend mass on Christmas Eve but a Lutheran church instead. However I want a more permanent severance. I researched it and I found out that while the Catholic church does not recognize defections anymore most individual churches will make a note of notices of defections on a baptism record. So I intend to write a letter to the church I was confirmed at advising of my apostasy.  When I told my mom about that she was upset and said I should at least hold off on making such a permanent decision, and advised to wait until I was 25. I said that was absurd. She then backed down until I graduated from college, I stated that too was absurd and I wasn't going to be a \"non-practicing Catholic\" throughout college. She finally relented to only wait until after my brother was confirmed next year because she's teaching a confirmation class now so she could get him enrolled for free and would be embarrassed by having me do that. I think this is silly since no one at the church will question her about it and it's probably not even allowed.  I'm suffering massive stress from this. I don't want to be part of some sort of \"Catholic community\", I want to be as connected as my father is. I'm almost jealous of transgender people, at least they have the option of hormones and surgery to solve their identity issues. I think my mom doesnt understand the weight of this on me and it's not a case if me simply not wanting to attend mass. I need some sort of relief from this.   Will I be the asshole if I take this step?\n",
      "I saw a post on a local job board fb group saying to call every day and bug them to show that you're interested in the job. As someone who does a lot of hiring it's really annoying when someone calls repeatedly asking \"did you see my application? Did you see my application? Did you see my application?\" Despite me telling them that I haven't started reviewing applications but I'll call them when I'm ready to move forward. I said as much on the FB post and said that if I tell someone this and they continue to can every day and annoy me I won't hire them because it shows that they don't listen. I got sooo many mean comments about how I must be so petty to not hire someone because I find them annoying, said that I have no business hiring anyone at all if that's my perspective, saying that I'm a shit person and shit at my job..... AITA?\n",
      "I was biking with my little kids who just got off training wheels. We went past a house where a guy was sitting on his front porch with his dog. As I was right in front of him, the dog bolted at me, fast. I saw a dark brown blur with teeth headed for me.  I had an instant adrenaline rush. All those things they teach you are true. Tunnel vision, I saw red, I was ready to fight this dog. So I did kind of fall over off my bike, but not all the way down.   The guy showed no reaction, and I yelled “what the fuck!?” He still did t say anything or move. I at least expected an apology, but he didn’t even call his dog back. I had tunnel vision so I didn’t even know where the dog was at this point. “Control your fucking dog!” I yelled in my meanest voice. He still just sat there smirking so I said, “If your dog comes near me again, I’m calling animal control.”  My kids had kept riding and didn’t really seem to care. When I got home I texted some friends in the neighborhood and asked if they knew any bald men with big, mean shaggy dogs and told them my version of the story. They couldn’t think of who it might be.  Then my wife got home. My kid told her “Cowboy scared Daddy.” The kid knew the dogs name? I told my wife the story and she laughed. Cowboy is an Australian Shepard, and she and the kid are on friendly terms with the owner and I’ve met him a couple times. Apparently it’s the sweetest, most playful dog ever. Deep in the recesses of my memory, I recall having chatted with the guy while he walked Cowboy. All the neighborhood moms are now texting me to make fun of me for getting scared by this dog.   So does the shock and adrenaline rush excuse me from screaming at a guy I kind of know whose dog is actually friendly? AITA? Do I owe the guy an apology?  Edit: one thing I should add is that although I’m not afraid of dogs at all, this scared the absolute shit out of me. I was still shaking when my wife got home a half hour later.\n",
      "So this really started during the lead up to the Brexit referendum, I found my mum's brother was posting intentionally inflammatory racist and xenophobic content on Facebook and called him out for sounding \"like school yard bully\". Apparently my mum knew that her brother has always been racist but I had no idea, although it makes a lot of sense when I think back. Him and his wife then attacked me and my mum on Facebook, that's when I deleted Facebook because I just couldn't be bothered with it anymore. Honestly it was really easy for me to cut out these members of my family because they had been awful to my mum my whole life. They still treat my mum like rubbish and I don't know why she let's them get away with it! So since then I have completely ignored this part of the family, they haven't been invited to my wedding or baby shower. Good riddance to bad rubbish.  People have told me it's stupid to cut out family for these reasons, but I think it's stupid to keep people in your life who do nothing but make you and the people you care about miserable. Sometimes my mum gets upset with me, she accused me of cutting \"her family\" out of my wedding and being an A. But quite frankly they never invite her to anything, so I don't see how I'm the bad one here. So, am I the A?\n",
      "We started dating around March and I had recently broken up with my ex and me and my ex still talked (it was just closure) and then I told my ex I won't be contact with him anymore and we stopped talking.  At that moment my boyfriend still talked to his ex whom he had broken up with last year and I didn't think much of it.  But they are still in contact, with her posting status /stories about him and texting him from time to time. He didn't tell her that he isn't single anymore. She wants to get back together. He did text her that he doesn't want to do anything with her but according to him she isn't taking no for an answer.  He is fed up with her hateful status and just muted her instead of deleting her contact all together and said something along the lines of \"she'd kill me\" (not the verbatim).  I feel weird about it and I feel he is leading her on, I did tell him numerous times to get some closure but I can't help but think it's a total deal breaker.  Apart from that, things are great but they aren't just friends, she wants more and he isn't firm? Also he didn't tell her he isn't single anymore as she'd feel bad.   We did skirt around the issue and I can't ask him to cut contact. It feels like a major compatibility issue since I'm not okay with it. Am I overreacting? Should I break up?\n",
      "I’m a college sophomore and I recently got a new roommate (let’s call her Sarah). Sarah and I knew each other vaguely before becoming roommates but we were never that close. I was optimistic about her being my roommate because I thought maybe it would bring us closer, but lately I’m starting to believe we’re not that compatible.   For some context, Sarah struggles a lot with her mental health. Last semester she spent a couple in the weeks in the hospital due to a serious depressive episode. Her home situation isn’t good as well (I dont know the full story). I struggle with my mental health as well but it’s gotten a lot better in the last year with consistent therapy and medication. Sarah however hasn’t and has frequent depressive episodes where she rarely leaves the room, stops taking care of herself (not showering, doing laundry, not brushing teeth) and shuts herself off from people (ignores text messages, doesn’t respond when I talk to her, skips her classes, etc) When she gets like this, the room becomes suffocating (and tbh it smells really bad) and I dont know how to talk to her. Any time I try, all she does is mumble or shrug.  I’ve learned that when she’s like this, my mental health takes a hit as well so I try to spend as much time as possible outside the dorm.   Recently we had to do these roommate agreements where we write out things like when to turn off the lights, what temperature to set the thermostat, how often we should clean and who cleans what, etc. I noticed however she wrote under the “courtesy” section that she expects me to be a consistent support system in order to maintain her mental well-being because trying to do it by herself can lead her to fall into “mentally and physically dangerous depressive episodes, toxic stress, and paranoia”.   I was kinda shocked to see this because she never told me any of this before and it felt like it was kinda thrown at me all of a sudden. I tried to set some boundaries since then, telling her that it’s hard for me to be around her when she gets into a depressive episode and that I need my space. Lately too I’ve noticed that we’re really not compatible and that I’ve been exhausting so much of my energy trying to be her friend. So recently I’ve been trying to spend more time by myself or with other friends. I still try to be nice to her and respect her needs. I say hi when I bump into her on campus, im quiet when she’s trying to sleep, I write notes telling her where im going and when I’ll be back, etc.  However, she seemed kinda mad? She stomps around the room a lot and slams the door whenever she leaves. She also never responds to my texts. I know she relies on me for her mental health but I don’t know if I can do that anymore. I do feel kinda guilty though because I think she thinks im ignoring/excluding her when she struggling.   AITA? Should I try to make more of an effort. I don’t want to be the reason she hurts herself  :(\n",
      "I am a female (19) with a 1 year old son. Due to issues caused by a car accident back in September 2020 I am living with my parents. I buy my own food and my son's food while my parents buy their own food. I label everything that is mine just to make sure that everyone is aware who bought what item. I don't touch anything that my parents buy because they bought it and its theirs. The problem comes when I bought a bag of chips that I wanted as a treat and I left them on the kitchen table while I went to town with my mother. I came home to find out that my dad ate the whole bag of chips, which was supposed to last me 2 weeks because I have been low on money due to being sick. And on top of the chips all of my protien bars were gone. I buy protien bars for breakfast because I am a vegetarian and want to make sure that I get enough protien every day. I asked my dad why he ate my food and he said it was because it was there and he didn't know who bought it. I told my dad that I would like if he would replace the food he ate that was clearly labeled as my food and he said that he has a right to eat anything he wants and he wasn't going to replace my food. Not only has he been eating my food but he has been into my son's food as well. My son drinks whole milk now and my parents normally only use 2% milk. My dad lately has been drinking my son's milk and when I told him to stay out of my son's stuff he yelled at me. I don't have any money to replace what my dad keeps taking and now I have no food left for myself because I have been stuck at home and not able to work because I have been sick. Every time I confront my dad and tell him that I would like to have my food I am told that I don't have any rights to anything that I buy because he has a right to anything that is brought into the house. AITA for wanting my dad to replace the food he took? Edit: just because everyone keeps asking.. I pay rent every month and both the internet and Netflix for the house. I also do 90% of the cleaning.\n",
      "So let me start by saying a few things, me and a friend had been planning to move in together for a while. He does the dishes when they're overflowing out of the sink and when he and his girlfriend need dishes to cook or whatevs. Anyway it was originally discussed that he and I would be living here, but his girlfriend lives here too. She's not on the lease and I didn't know they were together until they moved in. I should have figured considering they spend all the time they can together. The rent was planned to be split 50/50 because I thought it would just be he and I. I feel it would be fair to split it differently because there's two of them, one of me. I've made attempts to negotiate but it gets dismissed and forgotten. (Our rent is all inclusive for utilities, internet, everything)   We all have depression and I have anxiety, I'm sure not about the others. I've brought it up that we need to clean more often and more effectively to help deal with a fly problem that's developed as the seasons changed. They say it's a building wide problem and there's nothing they can do about it. Yet that doesn't makes sense because like I said they pile up dishes. They also leave wrappers and food out and exposed, they bring home leftovers they never eat and get moldy in the fridge, never clean up the living, leaving some smaller amounts of clothes in various places, and boxes and crates full of random stuff. I keep my trash in my room in bags to help prevent the flies, but I asked them to the same but they did what they wanted and they leave the trash exposed in the kitchen.   They also have a rabbit that kicks it's cage stuffing stuff all over outside of the cage, poop and food all over the floor in the living room. We don't have a vacuum.  I tend to keep my room clean, best I can. I could not step foot in their room without having to watch my step, you can barely get through the door because there's so much stuff in there. Dirty dishes and open exposed food wherever they can stuff it on a counter. Also not that I'm intruding, they invite me in sometimes to play games or talk about whatever.  The bathroom is also bad random trash behind the toilet and whatever. Never cleaned the toilet once, just gross.   Like I've said, I've asked them politely to help clean the living room and stuff, because I want to have people over and not be embarrassed by the flies and garbage everywhere. Everytime it gets excuses and brushed off.  Maybe it's a lack of responsibility, im not sure, they're both older than I am (19). I feel like a parent asking or like I'm being too demanding, but I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do. It has been 9 months of this, the lease is up soon and I want a new roomie. I keep cleaning up after them, all the time and I'm very frustrated. Thank you for your time.\n",
      "Hear me out I know I sound like TA just with that.  I am super into football games (go chargers).  They aren't doing too hot this yeah and after every loss I'm kinda in a bad mood and hate to be talked to.  My team recently lost to the chiefs (side note, rivers gotta go) but it was at night time and after the pick I was in a TERRIBLE mood.  I locked myself in my room to sulk in my anger and heartbreak knowing that the season is pretty much over.   Me, my sister and my brother have had this tradition that 2 times a week when were all home we play the card game \"rat slap\".  Its a game we created idk how to really explain it but once there is a pair you slap your hand down on the pile and you get it, the goal is to have the whole deck.  I still don't know if its a real game or something we made to get aggression out lol.  I was still kinda mad about the game and I slapped my hand down at the stack of cards I could feel a crack under my desk and just to add on my shitty night I cracked my damn desk.  (it was an old and brittle desk so its not like I used all my strength).  My brother laughed at that but my sister didn't like that.  We finished the game (my brother won) and I won't lie I felt a bit better.  I guess my sister really didn't like that slap and told my mom about it saying \"its cause of football\".  I am annoyed that she would go straight to mom instead of even trying to talk to me first about it.  I am now banned from watching anything charger related until next season.  I am annoyed cause even tho the season is over I still like watching them play and I think my mom and sister are overreacting to me letting a little anger out.  AITA\n",
      "&#x200B;  For the last couple of years I have been on a student loan, as I was studying at university. During this time people I know had started charity drives and every year I have not been able to afford to donate.  This year I have a job and I am able to donate, which I have done, but with it comes a personal urge for me to let people know that I have donated. While I have not publicly announced that I have donated, I still feel like I did it for recognition to some degree, given the personal urge to discuss this (even when making this post I feel this is me asking for recognition)  What I am asking is should I feel like an asshole for feeling this way?\n",

I understand that MLE is a tricky subject for many POC in the UK, but again, it's very clear that it's my natural tongue, and I'm not Chloe from Portsmouth trying to be hard.   Anyway, I moved up North for uni and it's all very different. I was talking with a course mate (Joe), and he stopped me and asked why I was talking like that. He says 'why are you trying so hard to use slang?' I was like 'what? that's how I've always talked. You've known me for 6 months. This isn't an act I'm putting up.' He said it was offensive 'as a poc' and that if I didn't stop, he'd report me. I said ok.   Last night was 'powerpoint night' in my dorm and Joe was there. I decided to do my powerpoint on the slang I use, because I had noticed that people genuinely couldn't tell what I was saying sometimes. Everyone thought it was hilarious apart from Joe.   I was talking to Jane, and she said it was wrong of me to antagonise Joe. She listed off some bible verses about forgiveness, and essentially said I should 'leave Joe alone', even though he's the one coming up to me. Joe text me later that night to tell me he didn't appreciate the 'jabs' I made at him and that this is my 'last chance'. I'm not going to change how I speak.  AITA?\n",
      "Okay, first of all, I'm a 24f who has not lived with my parents in about 6 years now, as they moved 3 hours away. We barely see each other, and don't really talk much anymore either.  My parent's 30th anniversary was a week ago, and their original plans to celebrate it was a trip abroad, but due to current circumstances that was canceled and they decided to go on a 10-day road trip instead.   Depression has hit me hard this month, and I've lost track of dates (I didn't even realize my birthday was coming up until the day before) and have been trying to focus on things that would make me happy, so I didn't notice either when my parent's anniversary date came and went. I failed to text or call them at all on their anniversary, and I didn't call them at all during their road trip because I didn't want to distract them while driving. I honestly didn't think it was that big of a deal.   They got home two days ago, which was actually a particularly hard day for me, and sent me a text saying they're home now. I asked if they had fun and we had a very small conversation. Later on that night though I got a text from my mom saying \"Do you know what. It would have been nice to get a text or call from you on our anniversary. It was 30 years. It kinda hurts.\"   I have yet to reply to it, because I honestly don't know how to. I feel like such a butt now, but my boyfriend keeps telling me that I did nothing wrong and that I don't owe them anything. So, AITA?\n",
      "My English isn't very good, please bear with me.  I have two teenage daughters (14 and 16) who begged me for a dog practically all their life. We recently moved to a bigger flat near a park- I wasn't to keen on the idea of a dog in the middle of the city before.  I am very strict regarding my free time (I don't have much, obviously;) and how I am able to spend it. It's also very important to me that my husband and I can enjoy some time alone together, even if that's not often the case. We both work full time jobs. So I made it very clear that if we get a dog, it would be the task of my daughters to take care of him. My husband seemed to be on the same page with me- we talked about it with our daughters a lot, made it clear how much effort a dog actually is.  We basically set some ground rules, like:  - no parents dog walking, no feeding, - basically no day to day tasks for my husband or me  - if my daughters forget to take care of the dog in any way during the first two weeks, the dog will be back at the shelter  Went to the shelter and found a very fitting dog. I explain the situation and that we would take the dog, but only on probation for two weeks and then we decide.  We take him home, the shelter is fine with the probation time.  The first few days are going great. First Weekend:  \"I can't walk the dog I've got to go to the mall.\" \"I'll walk him tomorrow, but today it's on you.\" Guess who walked the dog. I was really upset, because they both left without getting an agreement, telling me \"We'll take him for a long walk in the evening.\" They did, but in my opinion that doesn't help the poor dog during the afternoon. He needs to pee.  I also asked them to bath him, because it was part of our agreement that he would get a bath once a week. They decided to sit in their rooms in front of their mcbooks all evening.  It's Sunday, eleven o Glock A.M, everybody's home, but nobody has walked the dog yet. I call for my girls, they show up. \"We walked him very long yesterday in the evening, he can wait a few hours.\"  Monday, I bring back the dog after a lot of fighting and screaming with my girls on Sunday evening. My husband keeps mostly to himself during this time.  Come home, husband ice stone cold, no talking, no laughing, finally we have a heated discussion. He basically says we should give the girl more chances, I say I'm not having it. They clearly showed there are not ready for the responsibility. I only feel sorry for the dog, because he thought he had found a forever home. He says it wouldn't have killed us to walk the dog a few times. I asked him if he wanted to keep the dog and why he didn't say so. He says that's not the problem, he just thinks I'm heartless and impatient. I feel very betrayed and attacked.  Girls come home- the dog is gone, as announced. Basically Armageddon. So, this was a week ago and the girls seem to be devastated. They don't even argue with me or mention the dog. I heard the younger one cry in the bathroom twice.  AITA?  &#x200B;  Edit. The dog got apparently adopted by a really nice couple without kids. Also, I am not from a country were kill shelters are a thing. I would have never ever done that.   &#x200B;  Edit 2: I'm confused regarding the bathing situation- many people here said it would dry out the fur of a dog to bath him once a week, but just out of interest I googled again and I still find the information that it is okay to bath a dog weekly, if you only use warm water?\n",
      "Ok so (16M) I don’t even play that much. Before  alI of this I played like an hour a day but now that I have nothing else to do I play 3-4h. I do all of my school stuff but that only takes like 3 hours.  Today when I had played for around 3 hours my (36F) mom came into my room completely randomly and cried about me playing too much and that I have to stop. She then told me that I could go for a walk with a friend but I told her that I obviously can’t do that under current circumstances.  She then started screaming like a monkey and said: ” You have to do something else than just playing games all day!” I had enough of her and straight up told her: ” I play 3-4h a day which is reasonable during this time so stop being a bitch and fuck off!”  She left after that and actually cried and I continued playing for an hour or so before going to sleep.\n",
      "I (23M) have a coworker (25M) who is a mooch. If you get something for lunch, he wants you to get him something too, but expects you to buy it for him because since you mentioned it, he says you offered. At first I thought maybe he had money problem, but then overheard him laughing and bragging to someone in another department about how he was able to scam lunches out of his coworkers, and he’s attempted to bully a free meal out of someone more than once. His general entitled attitude is one of the many reasons I don’t like him.  So yesterday my girlfriend and I had lunch together. He overheard me confirming before I left and asked what I was bringing him and I said nothing. He said I brought it up, and I corrected him. No, I was confirming we were still good and he was eavesdropping on my conversation. He started complaining so I had if he gave me money for his food I’d bring him something but I wasn’t going to buy him food. He started complaining about it again and I got irritated and said no money no food, and then I left.  When I got back my boss said my coworker complained I was being hostile. I told him what happened and how he’s constantly trying to weasel free food out of people, even some of the people he knows are struggling. So my boss asked around and several others collaborated what I said. My coworker got dragged into the office and now he’s pissed that I “narc’d” and how he was just kidding. Most of the office thinks he got what he deserved but a few think it wasn’t worth getting him in trouble over.  Today no one he asked told him what they were doing for lunch, and he’s whining that we’re alienating him. I said he alienated himself because of his behavior. He said I’m an asshole, but I don’t really feel bad that a mooch who thinks it’s funny to scam his coworkers thinks I’m an asshole. My little brother is on here a lot and suggested I post though, so AITA?\n",
      "I (35) took over my sister's (32) old place in the middle of the dessert where it gets cold. I don't like having people over to my house but both my brother and sister wanted to spend with my mom who lives with me. They were here for the weekend and the second they got here their kids started running a muck. I couldn't say anything because it would bother my mom. My brother and sister decided to take my mom into town to go shopping. My niece (22) decided to tag along with them leaving behind 6 kids between the ages of 3 and 15 with me. I kept my mouth shut again because my mom asked me to. Here is where the real issue begins. I have a cat that no one likes. For some reason my family thinks low of cats. Anyways with my family coming in and out the door was open for most of the day. My cat gets out and then comes back in when the door bus open. Last night it was around 33 degrees and I couldn't find my cat in the house so most likely be was outside. I opened the kitchen door waiting for him to come in. My niece (22) starts complaining that it's cold and so does my brother. In my head I figured \"hey if it's cold and you want me to close the door at least help me look for the cat and we can close it faster\". I continue to walk around the house looking for my cat and when I come back to the kitchen the door is closed, my niece took it upon herself to close it. I open it again and this is when my brother decides to do something. Help? No, no he starts bitching that it's cold. I snap at this point and I finally had to say something. I said \"if it's cold you can help me look for the cat don't close the door\". He gets up and starts telling everyone to get their stuff that they are leaving. They had about a 5 hour drive and this was around 11pm. I told him \"no one goes to your house and tells you what you can and can't do in your house. You're not gonna come to mind and pull that shit\" he counters with \"I don't kick people out of my house\" and I hit him with \"I didn't kick you out but my cat is important to me even if he's not to any of you\". I'm still looking for the car while arguing with him. Then like always my cat strolls in from outside all nonchalant. I look at my brother and niece and say \"look, now we can close the door\". They still left and that's fine. But was I the asshole?\n",
      "I am F65 he is M65. I have spinal stenosis, severe pain and I can't sleep in a bed, have to sleep in the recliner in the living room. He can sleep in a bed but prefers to sleep in his recliner on the lr. Problem is he stays up all night watching TV in the lr where I am trying to sleep. TV wakes me up repeatedly plus he is clanging around in the kitchen etc. Then he sleeps all day in the lr essentially shutting the apartment down. Can't do household chores, have anyone over, watch tv (I don't hear well so I have to have it up a little more), etc.  My thinking is if you want to live completely against the norm you are welcome to do so but you have to make adjustments as to not impede on others. Not expect others to live around your backwards schedule. I have asked him to watch tv all night in the bedroom so I can sleep where I have to in the lr. And sleep during the day in the bedroom so I have access to the apt during the day. There is no discussion, he does what he wants when and where he wants. My sleep is so messed up I sleep whenever I can, some here some there. Skipping a day at a time, whatever. I don't know what day it is or if it's am or pm.  Am I the asshole cos I want to live like the rest of the world during the day and sleep at night?\n",
      "My cousin isn’t the most responsible person in the world. He doesn’t have a ton of responsibilities and he comes off as a stoner. His father died when he was just a baby, and when our grandmother passed she left each of her children a certain amount of money. This cousin would get his fathers portion. In the past he has asked family to barrow money and I guess my mother was planning on giving him the money next time he asked to barrow money?  I thought that was incredibly wrong of her, since it is basically his money, she shouldn’t have any control of when he gets it or how he spends it. So I told my cousin probably 6 months ago because he hadn’t really talked to anyone in the family since my grandmother passed a year and a half ago. He text my mom, and she just didn’t respond for some reason. Well now he’s moving this week and I guess he needs money and he’s keeps calling my mother. My mom is furious at me for telling him, and now he wasn’t the full amount and not just what he needs. I told her “it’s his money you don’t get to control it”. She just hung up on me. Am I the asshole for telling my cousin?\n",
      "On mobile, so sorry for any formatting or typos.   Earlier today my husband and I took our 2 boys (9 and 3, both mentally disabled) to visit my husbands side of the family.   The family members are mostly older and don't get out of the house, so my husband and I do a lot of shopping for them due to world events. We come and visit once a month with our boys. They never really cared to much for me, and always found ways to exclude me.   Well, today when we were leaving the family wanted hugs and kisses from the boys before we left.   My youngest signed 'no' when I asked. My oldest (who is just starting to verbalize) said he didn't want love. I asked him if he would rather give a fist bump or just wave, and he went to give a fist bump. This is a normal occurrence.  One of the aunts got upset and said she wasn't \"doing that fist bump shit anymore,\" grabbed him, and pulled him into a hug.   I immediately pulled him back and told her he said 'no' and that she needs to respect that. I was told I was being incredibly disrespectful towards them, and that I was being a bitch by not making my kids give them hugs and kisses.   My husband told them that they weren't to talk to me like that, and that they're lucky we even let them visit. We left.   My oldest was upset and thought he was in trouble, and I told him he did nothing wrong.   We got messages from the family saying that just because I had a \"bad childhood\" doesn't mean I need to project stuff onto the kids. We were also told I was ruining the relationship between them and my husband and kids.   I went through abuse when I was younger, and will admit that I can be overprotective of my kids, even more so with their diagnosis'.   I feel bad.  I just wanted my son to be comfortable with saying goodbye on his terms, but now I feel like I'm ruining the relationship between my husband's family, and my husband and boys.  AITA?\n",
      "I'm a grad student at a midsized private university. As a grad student, I am forced to teach during the summer session without a supervising professor.   Anyway, this is a lower level programing course. I gave the students a lot of freedom to do what they wanted for the final exam. One all male group submitted a program they made which provides a \"chance me\" of sorts for guys trying to \"get laid.\" They are supposed to self rate themselves in terms of things like attractiveness, confidence level, parental income, frat tier, and mutual friends as well as the similar characteristics for the girl.  The program itself works very well and is deserving of an A for its complexity and polish for a lower level class. I told them I would not accept such an assignment though and that they have to resubmit a different one due to it being sexist. I feel like I gave them a pretty reasonable extension too. My school has 2 summer sessions and this was at the end of the first one. I gave them until my final exam deadline at the end of the second semester, which is around a month for them. I also told them they could literally just change the inputs on the exact same program and just make it about something else and they'd get an A. That would take like an hour of mindless work at most.   They reported me to my Department Head who said I was within my rights to do this. The students finally relented, but they remain very angry with me and all said they'd leave bad RateMyProf reviews (which they sadly did follow through with).  Am I really being unreasonable here?\n",
      "My daughter and her significant other are staying with us until they have the funds to get an apartment. They contribute minimally to the household, since they are in their mid 20s and work. We cook and clean, all they do is clean their bathroom and bedroom besides the little bit of money they give us monthly which doesn’t even begin to cover their usage of heating oil bills/electric, the food they eat and other utilities they use. Now her SO is disrespectful, was nice at first but now true colors are showing. Blasts music while we are watching tv, knowing that we are watching it and we can’t hear the show, complains the dogs bark (a beagle, he’s old and he’s been with us for 14 years I’m not getting rid of my dog because the breed likes to bark and she doesn’t want to hear it) SO has done a lot more which will be too much to describe here and we  have gone beyond, taking on vacation, helping with their car purchase, and various other things. We told them to stop blasting music in the house, it’s not a big house and we, the owners don’t even blast music ourselves because we know it’s annoying if someone is trying to do something. Our daughter is mad that we asked for that to stop, and I’m leaving a lot of other occurrences out, SO has a serious attitude problem even in public with people she doesn’t know like food workers and she gets passive aggressive and in the past has sort of threatened us during a disagreement. We love our daughter but she’s changed while dating this person and allows SO to disrespect us. Am I the asshole for wanting them to keep their music down? I feel so stressed with all this, I wish they’d move out already. The music blasted while SO knew we were watching TV was the last straw. Now mind you I am a young parent with significant health issues, need heart surgery since breast cancer radiation injured my heart and I ended up having a heart attack. I’ve been trying to avoid conflict because when I get stressed I end up in ER with fainting spells and arrhythmias with my cardiomyopathy.\n",
      "I'm lesbian. Been out for a while, and they know. I genuinely don't think I was in the wrong here, but the way that they're acting is so insane that I feel like I have to have missed something!  My dad has literally stated that he thinks letting same-sex couples marry each other will ruin society. He talks around himself, too. He says they can have the same benefits, they just can't be married, then later claims that them having benefits is what will hurt \"normal\" people. It's obvious that he's trying to cover up his homophobia. He's one of those \"hyper Christians\" and he thinks it's okay to push it on everyone else. It's mainly my dad that I have issues with, but my mom is really passive and doesn't stand up to him. We have a better relationship, but I gave up on getting any support from her. They're both Mormons, for context.  Things came to a head a few days ago, when my dad was talking about how \"gay people getting married will hurt everyone\" and that he would vote against it (and has). I, admittedly, kinda lost my shit and yelled at him, saying that he couldn't say these things and still pretend that he accepts me. He plays the victim card, claiming that I \"make up drama\" and that I need to learn how to \"agree to disagree\". I told him that agreeing to disagree isn't a luxury I have because it directly affects me, while for them, it's a nebulous issue.  Eventually, I told him that if I got married, they are not invited to attend and that they will not be allowed to meet my wife. If he works against same-sex marriage, then why would I invite him to mine? I felt like this was reasonable.  But their reactions blew me away. We were talking about a wedding I  might  have  someday . I'm not seeing anyone. But they went on about how they \"damn well better be invited\", how \"I always have to make it about me\", and that I \"shouldn't take it so personally\". They brought up things like how they raised me, and that they \"hope I know and regret how much hurt I'm causing them\".  It got  really  heated and I had to leave before it got out of control. We haven't talked with each other since.  Did I make some deathly grave insult through that? Is it some unknown-to-me societal rule that parents  have  to be at the wedding no matter what? Is the blanket statement what offended them? Should I have let it go because of the cult they grew up in?  They claim that they'd love my wife as a member of the family, but if this is how they think it's okay to talk around family then I don't feel like my wife should have to put up with that.  I feel like my choice was reasonable (even if I was angry and admittedly rude at the time). But their reactions surprised me. While I don't think I did anything wrong, the question has been eating at me a lot and I've felt kinda sick.\n",
      "I bought him a 17 dollar gift on amazon which is a lot of fucking money for me, and he takes the goddamn lock off my door handle because apparently I stay up too late...??? I don’t even. So right now I’m just gonna sell the gift I got for him, because I honestly don’t feel like spending  all that money on someone is worth it for them to do something shitty to you like that. Now I have to literally buy a new goddamn doorknob and install it because of him. He really pisses me off. I even heard him say that when I’m on houseparty with my friends (it’s a video calling app instead of FaceTime) that he “listens” to my conversations like ew what the fuck? That’s just another reason to sell his gift. So am I the asshole in this situation   Edit:ok situation resolved\n",
      "Yesterday and today my husband and I discussed getting fireworks for ourselves and our kids (11 and 16years old), he even told his boss that's what he was planning on doing tonight.  He instantly got upset with me when I asked him when he was gonna go get the fireworks, and decided that he needed to take a poll of who in the house wanted fireworks, except for me - according to him, because I wasn't feeling well, I should be napping. (I laid down to appease him while he was out).  Right before he returned I had to go to the bathroom (we have 2 bathrooms in our house - I used the one attached to our room), he returned while I was still occupying, and still crying in it. He was demanding to use it because he had gotten mud on the back of his leg, and refused to use the tub in the other bathroom.  Also, our 11 year old daughter was with him, in our room, waiting for me as well, for no real reason other than she wanted to go shoot fireworks. All of this upset me to no end because I don't want to be rushed or have people waiting for me when I'm having stomach problems. So I just finished quickly and left.  My husband is telling me how he got mud on his leg, but I'm pretty upset and it shows. He then begins to yell and fuss at me about how it was MY fault he got mud on his leg because I'm the one who sent him out there, and how it's a huge waste of time and money.  I may be the AH here because I yelled back that he made a promise to me and his daughter that he tried to back out of, and he even told his boss that his plans were to shoot off fireworks with his wife and kids tonight, hence why he's not at work, and he's acting like a giant dicksneeze by blaming crap on me.  So, AITA?\n",
      "I (42 male) have been with my wife (37f) for about 8/12 years total, married for just over 5.  Now, I like to keep clean-shaven with a closely cropped, fade haircut.  I've had that look since well before we met.  Obviously she married me so the look wasn't a dealbreaker for her, but my wife kind of has a thing for \"hockey hair\" with at least some facial hair if not a full beard.  I don't like the way it looks and feels when my hair starts to grow out.  Full beards itch the hell out of me and I think just mustaches or goatees look kind of sleazy--no offense to anyone, purely my opinion.  For the first few years we were together the way I cut my hair and shaved was a bit of a bone of contention but as I think my wife realized she wasn't going to get her way about it she pretty much dropped the issue.  That was until a few weeks ago when we went to my parent's house for a Sunday meal.  My sister and her husband were there and he had grown a full, bushy beard which we'd never seen on him before.  When my wife and I commented on it he responded \"Yeah, well, [your sister] wanted me to grow a beard so I did.\"  After we left it became clear that this had completely reignited the old argument between my wife and me.  She said things like \"See?  Men do things like this because it's what their wives want.  Why are so damn stubborn about keeping your certain look?\"  I think I'm in the right and my wife just needs to drop it.  Maybe my BIL doesn't care as much about his look as I do. But, then, sometimes I think maybe I am just being stubborn and should at least compromise a little if it would make the woman I love happy.  Tl;dr I keep clean-shaven with a very short, military style haircut.  My wife would prefer if I'd let my hair grow out a bit and grow a beard.  Recently my BIL grew a beard because it's what my sister wanted and my wife thinks that's just something husbands do.\n",
      "I’ve always gone all out when giving gifts. For every occasion possible, I would either buy something of good value that they’d enjoy, appreciate, and/or be able to use, or make handmade high quality goods (the latter being the one I do the most often now). A lot of thought and time goes into these gifts.   So I have a large group of friends and some of us are closer knit than others, though I’ve known one for significantly longer. Over the years, I have given her (I’ll call her Old Friend) many handmade goods such as handmade soaps and other care products with high quality ingredients, home baked goods tailored to her taste (she likes sweets but nothing too sweet), and trinkets of all sorts for (primarily) Christmas and other events. Never has she once given me back a gift or expressed further gratitude past the immediate thank you after receiving a gift from me.  At first I thought that it may have been a financial issue or something against gift giving and usually brushed it off since we were good friends and had similar interests and experiences we always talked about. But recently she’s been talking about how she has a very good financial standing and could probably buy us (the closest friend group) anything we wanted, at least twice a month. So when I prepared Christmas Gifts this year, I didn’t prepare a very big one, feeling like I’ve been receiving a short end of a stick for years (having received nothing).   When the time came for all of us to exchange gifts, all the gifts I gave my other friends, which included soaps, lip balms, chocolates, cookies, cake pops, all from high quality materials, given out depending on their personal taste in gifts and closeness, I gave Old Friend the same gift I gave to the friends I weren’t as close with (which was still pretty good, as not close friends were still super excited to receive them and open/ate them on the spot)  My close friend group had also gone all out to get gifts for our group, having everything either personalized or personally picked out. Old Friend got a gift from everyone in close friend group. But like always I didn’t receive a gift. Actually, the only gift anyone received at the point of writing this, was a digital drawing Old Friend made for the only other girl in our group. Which I believe she made in a day or so.   Despite this, I still feel like I may have been a bit harsh about suddenly giving a much smaller gift than usual, especially when she saw me give big ones to everyone else and we’ve also been friends for the longest. AITA for doing this?  Edit: My other close friends all got me amazing gifts (I saw some people being confused about this), so it’s not like all me friends are like this.\n",
      "I (25f) was adopted out of foster care and I've been in contact with my bio mom (41f) for about 6 years now as an adult. She bought a really nice plot of land with a trailer and garage on it for 10,000 a couple years ago.  After all her meth friends destroyed it (and I mean just trashed) she abandoned the property. During this period of time, the city ticketed her for the eye sore because there were just piles of trash in the yard and stuff.   A few months ago she asked if I wanted to take it off her hands and I said sure. She then left the state. It took me like 3 months to get the trash out of the yard, move all her accumulation of stuff into the garage, and get the property livable. It costed me a good 3,000 so far.   Originally the agreement was that she could live in the garage but due to unforeseen costs I was unable to pay to make the garage livable so she agreed to live with her gf in the meantime. At this same time I offered to help her apply for a stimulus check to which she agreed and gave me her ssn.  Today I called her excited to tell her that her stimulus would arrive Wednesday. I offered to keep it in my bank account that I dont even have a debit card for so that she wouldn't have to have that much cash around and I also asked to borrow a little to buy a water heater because the one here doesnt work. She got really mad and started saying I'm accusing her of not being responsible and that I was being greedy asking her for money.  The argument got really heated and old fights came up and she started blaming me for not helping her with the property when it was hers, that I just wanted to take and take from her. It got to the point that I told her to have someone come pick up her mountain of stuff and not to come here herself or I'd call the police.  I feel like I might be the asshole because I did say she could live in the garage here and I definitely said some mean stuff that I never would've said except for the heat of argument. Should I apologize? Feel free to ask for info because there is a ton of backstory tbh and idk if I included everything to make a judgement\n",
      "So I started working at Subway over the summer and began working with a teen in my grade and she’s cool. We have a lot of fun together at work and she’s my favorite person to work with. However I always thought of her as more of a friend.   Then one night she said she was mad at me because I didn’t come to a party she had. (Mind you I already had made plans and there was drinking and vaping and I’m not about all that) anyways I asked if that was why she was mad and she said it was also because of something else. I kept asking what it was but she wouldn’t say. All she said was that a clue was her snapchat story from 2 days ago. The story was about telling your crush you like them. I put 2 and 2 together and realized that she was mainly mad at me because I didn’t realize she had a crush on me. I felt bad because I didn’t like her in the way she liked me and I figured I should let her know. I told her and I feel like she was kinda upset.   AITA for telling her this and not realizing that she liked me sooner?\n",
      "AITA for not inviting my husbands aunt to our wedding? Also, on mobile so sorry for formatting.   So, my (f20) husbands (m19) aunt is upset that we were unable to invite her to our wedding. To start off, yes a wedding that just happened is not ideal but due to circumstances this is the only time we could do it in the near future. And yes, we’re young but again, due to personal circumstances we got married now.   My husband and I have been together for a few years, but we just got married yesterday. We had 20 people, all socially distanced even though where we live doesn’t have restrictions right now we wanted everyone to be safe. The guests were 8 of our closest friends and then the rest was immediate family, plus a photographer and my MIL’s 2 best friends that are also considered family to us. We were both upset that we couldn’t invite more friends and family, but given everything going on in the world right now, we didn’t want to put anyone at any risks.   A few people posted pictures from last night, and today I posted a few to let people know who couldn’t make it. Most of my family was unable to make it, only 4 people. We got a text a few hours later from his aunt asking why she wasn’t invited and we told her we decided that we wanted it to be immediate family and our best friends and we explained why we only invited who we did. She didn’t take it well, and now she’s texting the rest of my husbands family telling them how awful we are for inviting his moms friends over her. The friends we invited are his godmother and his ‘aunt’ (close family friend that we both love.) we both feel bad for not inviting her because we do like her but we only wanted a few people and we decided that we wanted to keep the amount from our respective families pretty even so that we both had people we love there.   AITA (are we) for not inviting his aunt who would also bring 5 other people?\n",
      "I am the only tech savvy individual in a family full of people who are awful with tech yet depend on it for their livelihoods and leisure time.  I was always good with computers and such from a young age and after fixing things for a few family members word got out and I have spent the last 10 years as the IT guy for the family.  My problem isn't with being IT for the family.  My problem is with a lot of the family members that spend so much time on their devices yet refuse to learn or do even basic troubleshooting.  My mom and dad actually google issues when they come up and only after they have exhausted that route and checked cables and rebooted do they call me.  My aunts, uncles, and grandparents just seem to throw their hands up and admit defeat at the first sign of something not working just the way they are used to and start blowing up my phone for help.  This probably wouldn't be a big deal for me except they all have the same 6 or 7 problems over and over and they are super easy fixes.  I have shown them all how to fix these problems.  Hell I even gave them printouts of step by step directions on how to fix them, but they just ignore all that and call me to try and get me to come over and do it for them.  At this point it has gotten so bad that I just started ghosting them and making excuses not to go over just to avoid conflict as these older family members have a tendency to get dramatic when they are faced with any sort of conflict whatsoever.  I want to avoid it for my parents' sake, but I am losing patience.  I was thinking about just texting all of them and explaining that I have done everything I can to help them fix these issues themselves and going forward it will be up to them to fix their own tech issues as I just don't have the time to be going over to their houses every week to fix things.  Though what I really want to text them is \"It is time for you stubborn old fucks to learn basic tech troubleshooting or start wasting your money at Best Buy because I am sick and tired of your proudly tech illiterate asses calling me up at all times of the night because you can't spam share your weird Trump memes for a few hours or something.\"  I think that one might be a bit too mean though.  So would I be the asshole here?  I feel like a dick because outside of this behavior and some past drama they really have been great supportive family to me, but them being so proudly tech illiterate and refusing to do basic steps for themselves is really just making me not even want to spend time with them because each visit will inevitably end with someone bringing me a phone or a laptop to fix while I'm there.\n",
      "My really good guy friend was in a relationship and got cheated on and dumped by his girlfriend. I was one of the few people he talked to about it. Two weeks after having discovered his ex was cheating, he found out I had feelings for him, by reading a blog post I'd written about having  a crush on someone and pushing me about who it was about, till he finally asked if it was about him.   He told me that given the mindset he was in, he couldn't treat me the way I deserved to be treated, but he still cared a lot about me. He told me never to cry because it felt really wrong to me when I cried, and that he admired me and my strength ( owing to having had a tough past). Anyway we stayed friends,  and I even met up with him when I visited his city, and everything felt normal.   However, he slowly ceased communication and began to get distant. He seemed really depressed and went a day or two without replying to my messages. When I asked him about it, he said he meant to call, because he knew I'd be upset, but he got busy. Then he told me it was okay to hate himself because he hated himself too.  I felt bad, and ended up doing little things to cheer him up, like giving him a handmade card for his birthday, sending him pictures of food he liked etc. Recently he told me there's more to him than food and we could talk about other things as well. I feel thrown. For one, I keep trying to reach out, and now the content of the conversation I'm making is being criticised. How can I make good conversation when I  don't even know if I can expect a  reply?  If he hadn't been a relatively good friend, I'd have walked by now. If he hasn't just been hurt, I'd not have been this patient. However is it's been 4 months now and this dancing on eggshells is exhausting. Am I the asshole for wanting to subject him to an honest conversation about whether we are even friends still, given he may be a bit depressed?  Also, the conversation can take place over text, or in person in another 2-3 weeks when I visit his city, where I'm uncertain we will even meet at this point.\n",
      "My sister(27f) and I(25f) always had an okay relationship. Not super close though, so I was surprised when she not only asked me to be in her wedding but to be her maid of honor. I told her I would be honored and was upfront about the fact I would need some advance notice of dress shopping because I'm a mom of two kids, and my husband and I aren't rich. She was like sure, that's fine, dress shopping will probably be in three months (from when she asked). I was there with her when she found her dress. And I was there with her for some venue tours. Once that was over it became more extreme. She told me she wanted a bachelorette party in a specific spa venue, she wanted dinner at the fancy restaurant next door to it and she wanted to go to a bar and have a stripper as well. She had already costed everything and handed me an itemized list of all expenses for this bachelorette party she wanted. It was, down to the people she had mentioned, $4000USD. The spa package alone was $3200 and then the restaurant (which could have been off if people ordered more food or something different than her plan) was $600. I expressed that it was too much for me to pay. She told me they accepted payment plans and to speak to the other bridesmaids. They all said that was a cost the maid of honor gets.  After that she dropped shopping for dresses on me with three days notice and sent a photo of the dress she felt she would want me to wear. It was a $450 dress that would cost more to get in my size potentially. I told her I wasn't going to be able to afford that. She told me not to sweat it. Then the day comes and she decides she has found the dresses she wants us to wear and the store asks for an upfront payment. She said that would be no problem. I told her I couldn't afford it yet again. She told me she was really disappointed I was trying to make a big deal out of it. I told her I literally didn't have the money. She said how could I be the maid of honor she wanted if I couldn't even afford the dress. She said it was the cheapest expense. I told her I probably shouldn't be her MOH then. She was so pissed off about that.  And ever since that I have been hearing all about it from her. My parents asked if we could find a way to work it out. I told them I had tried to be honest and accommodating but I couldn't magic money from nowhere. She had a last minute change of venue and when the invitation came it was for an out of town expensive hotel and no kids are allowed. I had brought up that I wasn't sure we could go. She was furious and said I was making her wedding all about me.  It makes me not want to go. Not only would we need to travel for it, but we would need a babysitter for our kids, and to stay at least one overnight if not two, because we never fully figured out how far everything is from one venue to the next.  WIBTA if I don't go?\n",
      "I(29M) and my brother(28M) grew up extremely close. We did everything together. When he turned 18, he got arrested and sent to prison for 5 years. I would visit him while he was in prison, but he wanted no relationship with me. Even when released, he would not reach out. I gave up on working on a relationship with him. I am now married, have a daughter on the way, and work in the government. My brother lives with my parents, does not have a job and spends most of his days drinking.   A few months ago, he texted me asking if we could meet at a local restaurant. We met and he asked if  I could give him $2,000 to help him get back on his feet. The only thing I asked was that if I gave the money, we could build on being brothers again. He agreed and I wrote him a check. He calls me and tells me that he needs more money. My parents kicked him out of the house and he needs a place to live. I asked him what he used the money I gave him on and he told me that he used it on alcohol and clubs. He asks if I could give him $15,000 and help him find a place.   I told him no, that it was a lot of money to ask for. I offered to help him find a place that he can afford if he wants. He hangs up on me and sends me a long text that I have always been the favorite son and he never wants to talk or hear from me. I did try to reach out, but he blocked my number.   AITA for not giving my brother $15,000?\n",
      "I'm a single mother and my 16-year-old son is upset with me for that, to contextualize this, it happened a month before the quarantine began in my country, my son had received an invitation from his girlfriend to the 15-year-old party that his mother was organizing, It was a weekend that we usually go out as a family together for a walk, I never had a party of 15 years and he is my only son so I never took importance to those things.   When the day of the party arrived, we went for a walk to a park as usual (the place where the party would take place and the park were more or less 2 hours and 40 minutes away, while from the house it would be only 1 hour and 30 minutes), my son was extremely nervous and told me that he had prepared everything so that when we returned home he would take everything and leave immediately, the problem started here, as I said never take importance to those parties and did not think about That is until when we got home my son took a shower, dressed for the party and took everything ready to go, when he asked me to take him I told him better not go, because he did not see the point of going, we were in an argument For a few minutes until he decided that he would not go to the party and would be punished for the argument, he was visibly upset and locked himself in his room.  I mention it because in a recent talk we had he told me that his girlfriend cut him a couple of months later for ruining his party, it seems that he was something important at that party or I don't know but he told me that was my fault  Edit: I just not talk English so in a comments quest me if that party its quinceañera and yes, was a quinceañera but i never had it so i dont know how important is for the girl and, im from South America\n",
      "Ok so I have a few things that make me feel down and I often start feeling sad for these reasons. My mother wanted me to talk about it with her but I declined several times and was asked several times. After a while, she told me that I should at least talk to someone, and she felt sad because I was sad and my talking to her would make both of us feel better. I didn't want to talk about it with her because a few months earlier, when I tried to talk to her, she laughed at my problems and said they weren't real problems, and I didn't want that to happen. (She repeatedly promised not to laugh)  I talked about it with my sister and she promised not to tell my mother, and after a while, my mom finds out from her. From what I understand, she forced my sister to tell her, else she would get punished heavily, and my sister told her, as she didn't want to be punished.   I get mad at my sister and refuse to play with her. (She likes playing SSBU with me)  Am I overreacting to what they believe are the best things for me? And if so, what should I have done or do now? AITA?  INFO: I am 14M, Sister is almost 7\n",
      "REPOST ON THIS SUBREDDIT!!  For context a couple of days ago i sent a picture of my ex to one of my gay friends  we are gonna call him O  me and O are very open about us being gay so when i sent a picture of my ex to O i thought he would reply \" oh he's ugly\" or something like that but then he started saying that he wants my ex's Number and it went so far that he took my phone to get it from my contacts  Today he was something else he wouldn't stop asking 24/7 he'd ask me for his number i kept saying no and O said he's just going to see if they \"vibe\" and \"to test the waters\" i wasn't having it and kept telling him no so i got tired and i made a gc with one of my other friend's and asked him to back me up and he did but O was livid  He started saying he's more experienced than me because he's s \"older \" (our age difference is 1 year) i reminded him that its only 1 year so how can he be more experienced and then O kept asking and asking for me to give him my ex's Number so i told him I'm going to block him if he continues and now he's mad at me and not speaking to me at all  But i was just protecting him because my ex was very manipulative and toxic towards me and some of his exs   And now im starting to think i may be the asshole for not giving him the number.   AITA?  Mini Update?  Me and My friend talked and he sent me an vn or voice memo thingy and asked why im being so protective and why wont i give him the number  I told him i wad protecting him from getting hurt for like the 7th time and he told me i should think about giving the number and i replied Ok now he's nagging and thinking i wsd gonna give him the number  But i asked him what does he want from my ex and he said \"im not sure, definitely not a relationship\" So i replied why eo you want his number then do you want sex or something and he said idk  Thats lowkey all i have to update on this situation  Huge UPDATEE!!!!  Me and O had a full blown argument and he ACCUSED ME OF BEING TOXIX LIKE.. thats not all He asked me to be FULLY honest and tell him why im not giving him the number so i sent him a long long paragraph why and told him im done talking about it and he's spamming me 24/7\n",
      "Hi, I am a senior in college. I rely on my GPA to pay for school, if my grades drop lower than a certain amount I will not be covered for the following year.  In the first day of class, our professor assigned us a group project and paired us up with the person next to us. I was assigned with Danny. Prof said he didn't care what happened between the groups, he didn't want to hear about it. That would be preparing us for real life.  Since that class, I created a word document shareable and editable to us both. Created deadlines for small contributions to the project and so on.  We are near the due date of this project (due in seven days) and Danny has not even looked at any information regarding the project. Given the schedule change to online, we will have to record a ten minute presentation. I have gathered all the information in a table form with three columns stating the title, bullets and explanation. The project is basically done, I have enough information to complete it.  I emailed Danny through the semester, reminded him in class, and have emailed him some more to no avail. I sent him some ideas and he said he didn't like them. My boyfriend thinks I should just add his name on the project and call it a day.  I kicked him out of our two-man show. In real life, if you don't do your job you get fired, in college life you get free credit.  I sent the last email just now:  'Danny',  I believe I have thoroughly communicated deadlines with you in regards to the final project, to which you verbally agreed. I set up a project management tool that we both had access to since the first day of class. You have not provided with the minimum requirement of information to begin upon. The outline in the shared link had equal parts of the project setting us both accountable. Since you have not contributed to this, I will be withdrawing from our group. I don't have the availability to wait until last minute for this assignment as I have other classes to tend to. I wish you the best the remainder of the semester. -OP\"  I feel bad for the guy given that he will be unlikely to find a group within the time given, but also I feel relief knowing I have the un-responded emails to show for proof.  TLDR; I kicked a deadweight partner from a group project days before it was due  Edit to add: I emailed Dr. prof a month ago giving him the heads up that my partner had not contributed yet. Emailed him again two weeks ago. Then today I called. Since he never replied, I chose on my own to kick him out.\n",
      "I (19F) have a serious procrastination problem, I won't be doing anything till the last minute where it won't be possible to wait anymore, that being being said, my mom and I fight a lot, over anything, like literally anything, so I can't really tell when it's her being freaky again or I'm in the wrong, but recently it's been about the dishes, trying to be brief, she will go to work and leave the dishes in the sink and tell me to wash them, well I dont want to wash them so I don't, she comes home from work at night and gets all angry and won't speak to me till the next day, I tell her to just leave them there and I'll wash them when I feel to (usually at 1 am when Im half asleep and can't postpone it anymore but I'll always do it) but she just ignores me and washes them anyway for no reason then gets mad at me so it happens again the next day and it's just a never ending circle, among other things for which she gets mad for, so AITA?\n",
      "I live pretty far from the rest of my family.  For the last three years I save up and take my sisters on a vacation.  My youngest sis and I are very close.  My middle sister not so much.  The relationship between the two of them is sometimes outright hostile.  I’ve included her the last three times more out of obligation than anything else.  The reason I want to leave her out of this one is because she outright ruined the last.  She insisted on bringing her young daughter.  If me and my other sister did anything that a young child couldn’t be included in she would throw a hissy fit.  She kept starting fights with my other sister.  One of the nights she was letting her daughter be so freaking loud that the people next to us complained and hotel staff came to our room and asked us to quiet down.  Then she loudly said, “jokes on them, he didn’t even care”.  I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t have come to our room if he didn’t care.     Whenever her and my other sister would fight she kept threatening to leave early.  I just kept my mouth shut internally hoping she really would.  These vacations aren’t cheap.  This is the one big fun thing I get to do all year.  There’s just always some drama or hassle with her.  I know it would probably hurt her feeling or piss her off or both, but I want to be able to actually enjoy the vacation this year.\n",
      "Like the title says, WIBTA if i go on a vacation without my husband? At the last minute my family decided to take a family vacation. I asked my husband if he would be able to take off for those days. He told me that it’s a possibility. I said I would pay for everything since it’s last minute and he agreed. So a few weeks go by and I ask him again because we are about to book the flights and he said it wouldn’t be in his best interest work wise. I get that, but he should have told me in the weeks prior that it wasn’t a good idea. He told me to go ahead an go on vacation that he will be fine. He said it will upset him once the time gets closer but he will get over it. But I don’t think he will and will hold it over our heads. It would be the first time taking our child to a major amusement park and he has talked about taking him there in the past.  I told him if he changed his mind in the future he could come but he would have to pay for his last minute flight. AITA for planning it anyways?\n",
      "So end of last year, December, my childhood dog has passed and she was a huge support role in my life during anxiety attacks.  My dad had gotten himself a new dog, and once a while I call her and pet her whenever it starts to feel lonely and it boosts my motivation a little bit but the wounds have healed a lot (I already decided for a new doggo so I'm pretty excited).  My dad's dog had somehow grown to me since I am just most of the animal's favorite person. He would be upset with me cause it's his dog and I acknowledge it is his dog, but also said that I just wanna have some time with her too since she does walk up to me on her own and I don't like being loud at pets. My mom told me in private I should let him have the dog and told her that I am, the dog just sometimes comes to me cause I'm the one who feeds her (the dog obv) as well.   Also sometimes he calls loudly at the dog cause he is trying to be \"alpha\" (whatever the fuck that means) and I calmly talk with the dog to go out at times.   Am I the asshole that my dad's dog now likes me more than him?\n",
      "Throwaway even though I know she doesn’t have Reddit.  Last year, I (27F) started grad school. There was one other girl (28F) who started at the same time. Let’s call her Sandy. We had the same advisor, were in all the same classes, spent a lot of time together, so it felt like the universe was pushing us to be friends. We even went on double dates with our husbands.   Sandy is an hardcore SJW, to the point where she looks for people to slip up to jump on them and prove her superiority. This isn’t the friendship ending thing, I just add it here to describe what kind of person she is. If she’s not the best, she’ll try to take down whoever is.   Anyway. My husband and I have started trying to get pregnant. It’s been hard, because I’ve got PCOS which makes it hard to ovulate, which makes it next to impossible. I did get pregnant in December, but we lost the baby, and we’re still trying with the help of pills and stuff. I told Sandy both that we were trying and that I had had a miscarriage, because I thought she was a friend that could support me, but I told her not to tell anyone else because it was a painful personal experience.  I found out two days ago that she has told at least three other people (one of whom was her husband, which makes sense, but the other two are other students). I also learned she was thinking about telling the department, which I hadn’t planned on until months and months after I found out- I’m not even pregnant, so they don’t need to know! I went to Sandy and told her that it wasn’t her news to tell, it was incredibly fucked up that she was telling people my personal, difficult medical history without my consent, and that I couldn’t trust her to tell her anything about my personal life and I couldn’t be friends with someone like that. I said “so, we can’t be friends anymore”. She told me she didn’t even remember telling people, which to me is worse because it shows that she doesn’t care enough about my privacy to try and keep it secret.   AITA?   TL;DR told friend about my miscarriage, she told multiple people, I ended the friendship.\n",
      "Throwaway account.On mobile, so sorry for any mistakes.  Back story. I (24f) had my son (T) last year, and my mom was supposed to go down to part time around the time I went back to work. She offered to babysit while my husband and I worked, with my sister K (20)  helping out on days we both worked because she still lived at home.  My mom couldn't go down to part time, so K ended up doing the babysitting since she didn't have a job. My cousin also moved in, and when C19 cases went up she got assigned to the C19 floor at the nursing home. My husband and I didn't feel comfortable having T over there, so we spoke to K and she agreed to babysit at our house for a while. I didn't really love the idea, but it was the only safe option for our son.  After a while we decided that it was easier on everyone, since everything is baby proofed, and all of his stuff is there. Later K moved into an apartment with her boyfriend and his roommate. We decided to keep having her babysit at our house since we don't know the boyfriend very well, have never met the roommate, etc.  Now the issue.  My sister C (21) doesn't see us much, opposite work schedules. She just took some vacation time and wanted to spend time with everybody. She spent a few hours at our house Sunday, then Monday she sent me a message asking if she could go hangout with K and T at my house while I was at work. I didn't respond right away, as it was busy and not an emergency. She sent me a 2nd message asking the same thing. I was frustrated, but stepped away and responded to her. I told her I didn't really feel comfortable with people at my house when I'm not home. I made sure to emphasize that its not that I don't trust her of course, it just makes me uncomfortable.  I've also told my grandmother no for the same reason, and my husband very much doesn't want people over when we're away. Also as much as I love both of my sisters, neither are great at picking up after themselves and I really didn't want to deal with a mess when I came home ( which I didn't mention). C said she understood, and that was fine.  I came home that night and K mentioned that C had been blowing up her phone about how she was ready, and was gonna come over even though I hadn't responded.  K told her to wait. After I told C no, she started messaging K about how upset she was with me. She told K it hurt her feelings that ' i don't trust her in my home and around my son'. K tried to explain the situation, but C wasn't listening and instead just kept complaining about how I trust K but not her.   I want to reach out to C, because I feel bad I hurt her feelings, but I don't think I should apologize because I don't think im being unreasonable. I'm not sure where to go from here.  So reddit, am I in the wrong here?\n",
      "On mobile sorry...  My brother reckons I'd be a \"Karen\" if I did report this, but my neighbour lets his kids dig up the vacant block across the road to make bike tracks. He gives them a wheelbarrow, shopping trolleys, shovels, etc, and allows them to dig holes and build mounds.  If it wasn't for the fact that it's a popular shortcut I wouldn't care, but it's a large open piece of land that is popular as a shortcut at night because it connects the main road to our street and saves about five minutes of walking as opposed to going around (which is a lot at night).  It's not very well lit and I'm worried someone will get hurt, and council apparently thinks the same because they keep coming and flattening it out and getting rid of the trolleys. They just don't know who is doing it and therefore can't force them to stop.  My brother says I should mind my own business but I'm one of those who walks through there so it kind of IS my business. I want to dob them in.  WIBTA if I do? I don't want to be a \"Karen\".\n",
      "Hi, throwaway account because i don't want to be identified. (English is not my main language so sorry for any grammatical errors)  I (22f) have been living together with my roommate (23f) for almost 2 and a half years now. We've had a really good relationship as we have a lot of things in common. One of those things are food and we've been making dinner together most days, as we rotate, so every other week i make our dinner and she makes it the other weeks. When i was looking for a roommate i specified in the ad that it would be nice to live with someone who would want to make food together and she was up for it.  2 Days ago i had made a shepherds pie for us (which was delicious by the way). During our dinner, she suddenly announced that she has made a new years resolution to become vegetarian. I was a bit surprised and asked her why she was then eating my food which had meat in it. She told me that since i had already made the food that she would eat it as she doesn't want food to be thrown away which i think is a good point, but she said that she has stopped eating meat because she wants to be a vegetarian.  &#x200B;  I got upset and honestly felt very betrayed as i feel like this is something that should be discussed when living together and when we have our arrangement where we make and eat our food together. I told her that i'd already done the shopping for the rest of the week and it is mostly fish and chicken meals - and told her that if she doesn't like throwing away food, like she just told me, then she should eat those meals as well. If not i would be making too much food and probably throw some of it away. She didn't like that i challenged her logic and straight out told me i would be eating alone and that she is not interested in meals containing meat any more.  It escalated quite a bit and we ended up yelling at eachother,  after that which resulted in me leaving our apartment and i've now stayed at my boyfriends for 2 days, but i have to go back today. I haven't talked to her since since i am still very upset with her. It feels like a betrayal to me as i am not interested in eating vegetarian meat. I eat quite a lot of fish and chicken which she no longer wants to eat, so i feel like the nice thing we had with common dinners is now ruined. I wish that she would discuss it with me before turning to vegetarianism, since this directly affects me.  So, AITA?\n",
      "I was casually eating my sandwich on a bench   You can fit 3 people at most on the bench   Then this old overweight lady comes and she sits on the space beside me, she moves very slow and seemed out of breath  I had a face mask but I had it on my neck to eat, she also had a face mask but she wasn't eating, she had it down to her neck too  She didnt ask me if she could sit  When she sits down, I think to myself oh for fk sakes   I get up to go eat somewhere else   As I'm getting up she says \"no sit please\"  And when I'm about 10 steps away she says \"I'M SOrRRYYYyyYYYYY\"  When I found a spot to eat standing up I look back and she's not there anymore\n",
      "Putting 'racist' in quotes because one person thinks it is and one person doesn't.   So there are three people concerned here, E(m18), R(m18) and me (f16). R is very dark skinned, this is relevant later in the story.  Because of COVID-19 and social distancing norms, my friend group all did videocalls for each of of our birthdays. On one of the videocalls, in a separate chat, E sends a GIF which has a coloured man and the n-word in it. Then he tells R to go and look at it. I was horrified and texted him saying that that was very inappropriate. He told me to stop being judgemental and that the n-word isn't a bad thing to say. Then he says 'I have a lot of black friends.' I tell him that is an invalid argument and he then retaliates by saying that he's friends with R so it doesn't matter and he wouldn't say it in a bad way to R because R is 'not like that'. I repeated that it was unacceptable and he said that he couldn't talk about it with me right now and that I should stop being so judgemental.  So, reddit, please tell me whether I was TA and he wasn't being racist, or whether I was right and he is TA.  Edit: since someone asked for info, R wasn't amused, he just said WTF\n",
      "REPOST CAUSE THE OLD ONE HAD TYPOS AND ASKED THE WRONG QUESTION  Me and my brother are twins (28yo), I like to say we've always had a really god relationship. It hasn't been perfect but we've never gotten to the point where we didn't want the each other in our lives. When my brother was around 18 he got into heavy drug use like heroine and meth. I didn't cut him out but I had to distance myself from him cause of that. Around 20 he came back and got help, I was his biggest supporter in all that and I love him so much for getting off of it. But cause he was getting help and our family other than my parents and other siblings suck EVERYONE talked about him and either how he's doing alright or he's a loser that can't be saved. I had my first kid and when I was gonna announce it to my family was the first thanksgiving my brother attended since he was 17 and everyone talked about him. My first born was just swept under the rug, then the next year I had my 2nd kid and yet again all they could talk about was my brother and him being healthy. Don't get me wrong I love my brother a lot and I'm so happy for him you have no idea that he's got help and he's doing great. I am having my 3rd kid now, my 2 older ones are 7 and 8 so its been 7 years since people have talked about his addiction. I was excited that I was finally gonna be able to tell my family about one of my kids and not have my brother downplay it with just his existence. But when I was about to share the news my brother takes it first and HIS fiancee is pregnant too. I didn't want to say it too cause he deserves to not have his first child downplayed. I was happy for him I really was, I was happy I was finally gonna be an aunt but I couldn't help be a little resentful of him coming out like that.  He called me later that night asking if everything is alright cause I looked upset. I couldn't take it anymore and I just started crying, I told him that I'm pregnant too but didn't want to take away his thunder. He tried to cheer me up but I had to tell him. I told him how I'm resentful of his addiction and how he took the attention away from my first 2 kids and now my third. He told me that it isn't fair to blame him for that and I apologized but I just can't help it. He told me to get over it and that I should just be happy were having kids close together. I had enough of him downplaying my kid just like everyone else and I hung up, we haven't spoken in almost 3 days now.  AITA?\n",
      "This happened today. My family was getting ready to go somewhere and I was brushing my teeth in the bathroom with my sister while she was getting ready to shower. She said that she forgot to get a new pair of socks and asked me  to get her some. the nearest pair of socks was outside the bathroom, across the basement floor in a suitcase. it is a small bathroom and there is about 1.5 feet of tile in front of the shower before you hit the main basement floor which is covered in carpet. It was probably 15 ft from the shower to the suitcase.  Around a mouthful of toothpaste I asked her why she couldn’t just get them herself, I was in the middle of something and she wasn’t even in the shower yet & had her old socks on. She said that she wasn’t dressed all the way, I said that we are in the basement and no one is going to come down and see her, it would take her two seconds to grab them herself, and besides, I’m brushing my teeth right now. She told me that she needed socks because she didn’t want to have to walk on the cold tile to get socks after she gets out of the shower. Admittedly, I laughed at her reasoning which caused her to get mad. I told her that instead of wasting time getting mad at me, she should just get in the shower and I’ll get her socks when I’m done brushing my teeth so she’ll have socks by the time she’s out of the shower.  She then got really mad at me and demanded that I get her socks RIGHT NOW before she got in the shower. She said that she would take “a really fast shower” and so there was no way I would have time to finish brushing my teeth(I was already almost done) and get her socks before she was out of the shower. At that point I was sort of laughing and I told her just get in the shower and I’ll get you socks while you’re in there, you’re wasting your own time.  At this point she started screaming at me to get her some socks. I started getting annoyed by the fact that she chose such an odd hill to die on, saying that I will get her a pair of socks and to just let me finish brushing my teeth. IMO, I think she stopped caring about the socks and was just pissed that I didn’t heed her request right away and just needed a reason to yell at me.  Anyway, she was still screaming at me, I finally had enough of her shit and spit my toothpaste out. She began saying that now that I was done brushing my teeth I should get her socks, but I cut her off and told her that I was GOING to get her a pair of socks, but once she started screaming at me like an asshole I decided not to. I told her that she was asking me to do a favor for her and I don’t do favors for people who yell at me. I left without getting her socks.  I went upstairs and my mom asked me what the yelling was about, I explained my side to her and she told me to go get my sister some socks. I refused and said it was because my sister had yelled at me. My mom said I was being petty and I should’ve gotten her socks.  AITA?\n",
      "So, I work at a Hotel. I struggle with social anxiety, and genuinely have a lot of difficulty talking with people. It has unfortunately lead to a lot of negative reviews for the Hotel, as basically all I say to guests are where to sign, and how to pay. I even had a customer today make some kind of joke about being a quote \"man of few words.\". I didn't laugh, and they told me I should have. So I know that will lead to another negative one.   What do you guys think? I'm not trying to be rude, I just don't have much in common with the guests, and even if I did, I wouldn't know what to say.\n",
      "Just to get started, I'm not a medical professional, I'm a hobby biologist & tutor at a study school. As far as biology, I have a home lab that can handle up to BSL 2 (my country has very relaxed requirements for labs/research, it's considered a research haven), I've worked with lyme disease on multiple occasions but mostly genetics & biohacking.   My mom claims to have chronic lyme electromagnetic hypersensitivity syndrome, which is a combination of 2 \"diseases\" which are considered to be pseudoscientific by basically every sane medical professional. Chronic lyme, which is the idea that properly treated lyme disease can cause lifelong permanent side effects that can only be relieved by heavy antibotic use. Lyme disease can make you feel really shitty for a few months kinda sorta like mono, but it doesn't do that.   Electromagnetic hypersensitivity is where people say that electronics, radiowaves, magnets, normal background radiation/magnetism of earth makes them have all sorts of weird effects. Her \"diagnosis\" is a combination of both, she's essentially saying that lyme disease she did have almost 25 years ago is causing her a bunch of nonspecific illness, and the lyme bacterium made her body hypersensitive to electromagnetics. It's a 100% false bullshit diagnosis.   She also has fibromyalgia and some other chronic pain complaints. While controversial, my opinion is those are real diagnosis with real suffers. However if you put it alongside her \"medical cannabis\" (its legal here but stigmatized, she calls her cannabis medical despite there being no distinction) and fake diagnoses, it gets suspicious.   I told her that if she's advertising that she has a disease that doesn't even exist, I'm not going to believe her cannabis use is medical and I'm not going to believe her other controversial very subjective diagnoses.   AITA?\n",
      "Obligatory throw away, mobile, etc.   So, my boyfriend and I have been planning on attending my family’s thanksgiving for two weeks. We’ve been dating for 3 1/2 years, and neither of us have ever attended each other’s holidays with family. My parents and I were excited when my boyfriend said yes when he was invited. I’ve kept him in the loop with the details, and my dad is making his famous Mac and cheese JUST because he knows my boyfriend loves it so much. Well, last night my boyfriend mentioned “hey, I have a choice to go to my family’s thanksgiving or yours. Would it be okay if I went with them?”. I said “sure, I’ll text my parents because we’re trying to get a final count for tomorrow”. My boyfriend gets upset because I text my parents, and then I get upset because he’s mad. He wanted to have a convo without me assuming his decision, but we can’t because we’re literally heading into dinner with his mom and dad. AITA in any of this? I felt he made it clear he couldn’t come, but he’s saying he was trying to see how I would feel. He felt like it wasn’t a big deal if he didn’t come. Of course I’m upset, but it’s mostly because of how he told me he wouldn’t come.\n",
      "So me(25m) and my partner(22f) at the time (together for year and a half or so) were in a poly relationship, she had two other partners at the time one in South America and one on the east coast we lived on the west coast. I was fine with the long distance thing for her because I had some role play friends I had around the world that she was fine with. Now to the actual story. It’s mid December and I had gotten injured at work(sprained arm nothing to bad) but I was restricted from working till it healed so I’m stressed out about trying to get my bills paid. My partner just started a new job barley a week in as she’s spending the night and the next morning she tells me she’s already started having feelings for a coworker. I’m already stressed out and say no because I didn’t wanna talk about it at the moment. But we did talk about it over the next week and I asked her to give me a month to think and get my thoughts together. She agreed but still pestered about it for a couple weeks. I got so stressed out that I started having nightmares waking up in tears about random things like my siblings dying so I texted her and told her that I can’t do it anymore and that I’m gonna uphold something I said when we got together. “ if I feel like I’m gonna hold you back from being happy I’m gonna step back” so I did (yes I know doing it in text wasn’t the right thing at the time but I needed it off my chest. She came over that Saturday and we did talk about it completely finalizing out break up) she kept saying things like “it’s just your jellousy and controlling that made me this way” and that hurt cuz I was trying to make sure she was happy not myself. We tried staying friends but she kept sending tictoks about how not accepting poly was bigotry and how not wanting to let someone have another partner was controlling and selfish. I had enough and told her I felt like I was being attacked and harassed while I’m trying to price my life back together and trying my best not to let my depression and anxiety send me to the hospital again. She said I was over reacting I told her over reacting would be calling her and telling her to fuck off or to block her all I did was explain how I felt and asked her to stop sending the videos. What should I do from here?\n",
      "So there is a lot of things that happened and I’m gonna try to explain their side as well as I can. I was started dating this guy, I’ll call him Mark. One night Mark did something against my consent to me (I won’t go into too much detail, because the topic is not allowed on this sub). He admitted to what he did, after I opened up to our mutual friend group (it’s an organization on my campus) about it.   Afterwards two of my friends were having a hard time picking sides because they were also friends with Mark. They did not want everyone to hate him because they saw how sorry he was for what he did to me. They proceeded to talk to some people that knew about the situation about it. While they talked about it they revealed to them that I had previously hooked up with two guys in the same fraternity, I’ll call them Nick and Adam. I once kissed Nick at a party, when we were both drunk, but after talking to him for a week or so we decided to just stay friends. With Adam it was different. We went on a couple dates together because we really liked each other, but he is much older than me so we saw that it wouldn’t work out in the long run. I didn’t really do more than kiss them, we never had sex. In both situations we didn’t really want many others in our friend group to know, because we were still friends and it was easier just to stay friends instead of having them know that something happened between us. I did however open up about it to those two friends (which Nick and Adam knew about).  So those two friends told about 4 people about what happened with Adam and Nick, to give them more context about the situation with Mark. They wanted them to know that I wasn’t “inexperienced” with guys and that i had a tendency to hook up with guys when I was drunk (which wasn’t the norm for me) and that Mark was not the first guy I dated within the organization. They said that those people deserved to know the whole story before judging Mark. I didn’t think that those things had anything to do with what happened with Mark, and got mad at them for revealing things that I told them in private. It also felt like they were trying to defend his actions by doing that, but they argued that they did it to help me, because they believe I have a tendency to make stupid decisions when I’m drunk and that they partly went to those people to seek advice on how to help me. So am I the asshole for ending my friendship to them after this?\n",
      "Okay so I’ll keep this as short as I can.   My partner and I had a 6 month old baby girl and we are currently living with my parents whilst we save up for a deposit on a house.   I am currently on maternity leave, but due to go back in March - however if I do go back to work, my wage will just about cover the childcare. I really want to go back to work (I love my job) but there doesn’t seem to be much point. My partner & family want me to stay at home & look after the baby until she is able to go to preschool (when she’s 3) and even after that, only go back to work part time so I can still pick her up from school etc. Financially this makes sense as my partner earns a lot more than me.   However during a ‘hypothetical’ conversation with my partner, he informed me that as he is saving up for the deposit, it would be his house. And if we were to split up after we got the house, I would get out whatever I put in. This doesn’t seem fair to me, as I am at home looking after our child, so I literally cannot save as much as him, no matter how hard I try. I explained that should this ever occur, because I am giving up my career (at least for a few years) at his request, to look after our child, then I’d expect 50/50. He said no, because he’d be putting more in - again I explained that whilst I wouldn’t be putting as much money in, I would be looking after our baby, saving us the money on childcare & putting my own goals on hold. Again he said that wasn’t fair.   I said fine, I’ll go back to work and you and me split the childcare costs 50/50. It’ll take us longer to save up, but at least I’ll get a 50% share in the house. He is really against this as it slows us down massively. He said if I go back to work, then I’ll have to pay all the childcare, because it’s my choice to go... but I don’t see any other way I’ll get treated fairly?   Am I being unreasonable?  EDIT : he does pay rent - between us we pay £250 a month - £125 each  EDIT2: We ended the conversation by me saying “that’s fine but I’m never going to get a house with you then 🤷🏼‍♀️” so I’m not going to cave on this one.  EDIT3: to the people saying “you should’ve thought about this before you brought a baby into the world” - fully aware of that, thanks but bit late!  FINAL UPDATE:   UPDATE Hi everyone, just want to say thank you so much for all your amazing advice. Last night we didn’t talk about it, we just cooled off and went to bed. I think that shocked him a bit as usually I’m trying to sort things out before bed but last night I shrugged and said whatever. This morning he gave me a kiss and a hug and jokingly said “fine you can have all my money” (he then hastily explained he was joking and it was our money).  We then had a serious discussion and he explained that his fears were, if we did split up, I would leave and take our baby and then 50% of the house and he wouldn’t see her anymore - so he would have effectively lost both of us (“everything”) plus 50% of his assets that he’d worked so hard to build.  I explained that if we ever did split up, he could see our child as much as he likes, I would never stop him from doing that (which he knows as I’ve told him before!) but if the house wasn’t 50/50 then I would lose the house I live in, I would have to start my career again from scratch (I got very lucky with my job and who knows if I’d be able to again), and id get very little from him in the way of child support (I have now checked, thank you to everyone who attached links). Also that would mean to me, that he could just turf me out if he ever wanted to split up just like that.   He agreed that we should split everything 50/50 and apologised for his behaviour.  We are not married btw so in the meantime I might get an agreement written up in case it takes a while to get married.   Thank you to everyone who shared their stories with me, and thank you to everyone who was sympathetic.\n",
      "Throwaway, because its still an ongoing investigation at my work. Sorry for discretion, don't want to disclose too much info  I (24M) Work as a retail associate, about a week ago I was taking my lunch break with one of my friends (26F), and we were just talking and sharing laughs, she told me that she had a weird lump on her thigh and told me to touch it, obviously I said no, but she kept insisting how strangely big it was, eventually I succumbed to her wish and tried to feel for the lump, when she then started moaning as a joke. I chuckled and thought nothing of it, but another female coworker (35F, Typical Karen tbh) started to yell at me that this was not the place to be touching each other, and if we  wanted to do that we should get a room. My friend coworker was visibly embarrassed, and I apologized and said it wouldn't happen again. Karen didn't let it go, she told me she would be contacting HR so that 'We could learn our lesson'.  We got in to a full on argument which lead to Karen saying while looking at coworker friend 'How would you like it if you saw me touching somebody like this while you ate?', she then proceeded to rub my leg in a mocking way.  HR and I had a meeting, and told me she was completely right, and that the touching violated one of their policies. I told them that I would like to file a complaint countering hers because she had rubbed my leg as well. The HR representative, who also happens to be your typical Karen told me to 'stop being ridiculous' and 'quite frankly, you're being an asshole because you're just trying to justify what you did. She's a girl, do you feel harassed?'  Obviously the legalities are not up to me, and its up to HR to set it in stone, but AITA for counter claiming? I feel like I have every right to claim harassment from a coworker even if she is a girl.  Edit- I should also add, HR told me that I instigated the whole situation, and that none of the events would have occurred if we maintained a 'professional relationship' w/ everyone\n",
      "My boyfriend of nearly two years has recently gotten infected with bedbugs. About a couple of months ago I saw one for the first time ever in the bathroom of his home and advised to get his landlord to take care of it quickly because it was probably coming from a neighbor( very sketchy neighbors in a semi-sketchy apartment building).  He told me they came ,inspected ,saw nothing but exterminated.   Fast forward to about a month ago, one morning after spending the night at his place, I found a baby bedbug in the bed and saw the telltale blood spots on the sheets. I told him I wasnt returning until it was fixed. He told me he contacted an exterminator and they gave him directions on eradicating them which he followed and they were gone. I stayed away about a week to be certain. He assured me he saw none. Tonight I woke in the middle night during a visit and already paranoid, I took my phone flashlight and scanned the side of the bed and what do I find? A cluster of bedbugs just waiting to get their next meal. I woke him up to show him the evidence and left.  Now I want to ghost him because I feel they will never go away and I dont want to get infected with his house herpes in my new apartment of only three months(god forbid I havent already) and although he is very neat, he lives like a hoarder with boxes and boxes of clothes, papers etc. and will never have the money or time to clear every possible item of an infestation . Am I the asshole for wanting to leave since we will essentially never be able to visit each other until he somehow gets this resolved?  Edit: Im ready to leave because this has been a daily back and forth of him brushing off the problem and me and only me going through extraordinary measures to keep them from spreading. I bag my clothes in garbage bags when I visit, spray the bad down with isopropyl alcohol,  bag them again when I return home. Wash,dry the clothes, vaccum  and hope none followed me home. He can rarely visit because he doesnt want to follow \"the protocol\" which makes him feel like a leper. I dont have any choice but to leave since he's been lying about them being gone,because there is really no way I can see them and he cant. He even tried to insinuate maybe I was bringing them since he never notices them otherwise and now im just over it. Ghosting may not be nice but I don't prefer confrontation and he will just make more excuses. No sane person can live like this.  TLDR: boyfriend of 2 years has bedbugs, girlfriend wants to break all ties before she's infected too.\n",
      "Sorry, English not my first language. I'll try my best. I (f39) live with my partner (m49), and his 2 kids from a previous relationship. A couple years ago, my partner's dad, who lives in the USA, came to visit us, trying to reconnect with his long lost son after almost 30 years. The kids were really excited to get to know their grandpa. I was in the kitchen preparing dinner, and I overheard him in the dining room telling the eldest (who was 16 at the time) that he \"hasn't got anything against black people\" but it was a shock when he knew his daughter (my husband's stepsister) was marrying an african american. I heard the kid softly arguing but trying not to hurt their grandpa's feelings. I knew they were struggling and not feeling well. So I immediately went there and told my FIL that he was being a bigot, and racist comments are not allowed in my house. He could change the subject or leave, but bigotry is not a matter of discussion. He said sorry and chose the first. Maybe I was too harsh, but I saw my stepkid wasn't emotionally ready to start that argument with the newly found grandpa and I just wanted to cut it off. Then he returned to the USA. In January 2020, my partner went to the USA to visit him and get to know his stepsiblings.  He took his kids with him, while I didn't go because of financial reasons. It went really well and happily he found siblings wanting to start a relationship with him and the kids. Now my partner and his youngest are planning a new trip to the US for her quinceañera birthday, just a father and daughter thing. I think it's lovely. But my FIL is saying that I refuse to go because I don't like him. I really support my partner connecting with his family, but it's not my trip, I don't have the money, and honestly if I had it I'd rather go somewhere else. But my partner insists I should reassure his father I don't have anything against him because he's getting old, he almost died during the pandemics, and he's trying to do things better this time. I don't think I owe him anything, but he's expecting forgiveness. Aita here?\n",
      "Ok so I know the title sounds weird, but this is real also sorry for the formatting.  So, it's my friend's birthday in a couple of days and since I live in America, we have quarantine still going on, and now curfews cuz of the protests so I cant rlly get an actual present and give it to my friend. I figured I could atleast send her memes from shows that we've both watched and from books we've both read and also i have a cat so i could also send her cat pics. I told this idea to other friends who know her and some agreed and others didnt. The ones who agreed have pets too so we could also send dog pics and bird pics, but the ones who disagreed called me an asshole for basically telling my friend who's birthday it is that all our friendship means is just memes and animal pics when it rlly doesnt. If I could, I'd obviously get a more meaningful present, but with the protests and riots and my parents worrying abt letting me outside, I cant rlly get something. Sure, I could order something online, but I don't wanna risk anything COVID-19 related so this is all i could think of, reddit AITA?\n",

      "Growing up, my parents were getting divorced. I thought it was fair that since my sisters had to stay with my dad for school, that I would go live with my mom. We got a lot closer from the struggle we initially had. Things were going positively from there on out.   She met a guy she loved. I understood that she wanted a new husband and I said I was fine with that. Turns out, he is a racist piece of shit. I’ve never liked him after hearing him complain how basketball is full of “spades and clubs”.   My mother was also a smoker. I begged her for two years not to smoke. She didn’t listen. Her then boyfriend of one month asked her not to and she quit that night. I was also getting bullied including death threats and was once sexually harassed because of my weight. She did nothing. My dad did everything. Same with stuff like hygiene (she never got me a toothbrush or haircut). She also complained about the way I wanted to grieve over my grandmother’s death. I was nine.   I later had to move on with my dad because of financial issues. My life started going in a more positive route (now it’s shit but still better than it would’ve with her). She still had weekends and we were good together. I still despised my stepdad but she allowed me to be distant from him. Little by little I noticed that she was manipulative towards. Always wanting me to spill the beans on the family that I had plus made snide comments that knew bothered me.   She and I grew apart and she moved away. She came back for a week but instead of wanting to be with me like she said, it was more of trying to get information again. I blatantly said I’m not giving her any info and she got more distant again. We became estranged. I got her a microwave at 12 when she needed one. She gave me socks because I needed them.   We had a conversation about wanting to fix our relationship. She and I talked almost everyday for months. Then I was late to reply by a couple of hours and she never talked to me again until I graduated and my birthday. I said thanks and that was it.   She know has cancer and I heard that she complains that I am not close with her. My sister mentioned in passing I should try to reconnect if that’s what I wanted one year ago. I said nope and I’m not talking to her again. AITA?\n",
      "Me and my girlfriend had \"plans\" on Valentine's day, go to the mall, nice dinner, then spend the rest of the night at her house. But she was asked to worked until 7 and was kinda forced to say yes so that was the majority of the day gone already.  When I finally pick her up from work she asks if we can get her best friend and her boyfriend and I said no but she kept begging, I was miserable all night and told her and she didn't care, so I kept pushing at it and asked her how it was fair to me and she got really upset. Had I gotten to spend the majority of the day with her like planned I probably wouldn't have cared but I only got to go to dinner with her and her friends then took her home because she was tired.  So, AITA?\n",
      "Background info: I live in a considerably conservative community and hence its normal for adults to live in their parents’ place til they get their life sorted out. My parents happen to be extra conservative and even more unfortunately for me, I’m a female. Now onto what happened.  I’ve a close friend, E, (F 20) who’s birthday is coming up. My parents know of E since 2017, and I’ve stayed at her place twice. My mom, M, always mentions to me how I never ask my dad, D, whenever asking for permissions. She also mentions how in the eyes of a kid, both parents are the same, and my dad has mentioned previously that regardless of where I go, I should either text himself or her, so long as it’s just 1, but it would be better if I notify 2.  M has the habit of forgetting things that would otherwise work against her argument in a discussion. I had already asked and received the permission to stay at E’s place from M. There was a discussion recently on where to go on a certain date, which also happened to be E’s birthday, to which I said “Well since I already planned to go to her birthday, guess I’ll take a rain check” to which my dad stiffened and angrily mentioned that I never asked for his permission. One thing escalated to the other and they both were fiercely saying how their weekend was ruined and they couldn’t go anywhere to which I said that they could still go out together with my sibling, and hey I can leave early the second day and join them. Somehow my dad translated it to me saying “You can go anywhere if you want, but my decision is fixed and I won’t do nothing about it”. Firstly, they both know that I wouldn’t go if they refused, I’ve never done it, and probably never will. So my “decision” to go only happened because my mom remembered, but she then said that she didn’t even remember me mentioning the birthday sleepover. Okay fine, even if we go by that, here’s me mentioning it again, and I’ll only go if I got a 100% positive permission. It’s not like I’d go if D declined me to go.  Now both of them are mad at me and so disappointed because I was living like others my age. For general information, I know how others my age behave, and the kinda freedom they have. The only reason Im gritting the teeth through this is because they’ve been cheated from their childhood and each had a shitty past, and they expect me to somehow heal them by acting how they want me to be, and I know it’s wrong, but I still do because I’ve never done anything prominent in life to make them proud (with that being said, they usually declined a good amount of my opportunities). But maybe I am an asshole here, maybe I do need to be controlled more. I don’t know, please help me out here. Am I the asshole for not seeking permission from my dad?\n",
      "A quick one for you folks -  I just moved out of my old apartment and I did leave a knee sized dent in the refrigerator door. (yes I was dumb, and no I dont usually do things like that, the drywall was in perfect condition :) )  My landlord wants me to pay 500~ to replace the fridge. I want to talk to him about paying for the damage caused (replacing or repairing the door) which has to cost significantly less.  I know I did cause the damage and I want to pay for the damage caused. I just don't think buying a new fridge is fair.\n",
      "I am the oldest of three siblings from a very traditional Hispanic family. We grew up very poor and my parents sacrificed everything so we can live in a clean house and get an education. As we three have grown, we all have been able to graduate college (with loans) and get good jobs. My parent’s financial situation has worsened in many ways over the years. No retirement, they have a little bit of equity in their home and an AGI in 2019 of $17,000 but that’s it. No savings or emergency fund. My dad is in his 70s immunocompromised and my mom is a janitor at a public school. I live 1200 miles from my parents and my brother lives about 700 miles away. My sister lives locally.   I am worried sick about my parents health especially my dad during this time and last week I told me sister to go fill their fridge and I would pay for it. She did the leg work and it cost me $130. Well on Friday, the fridge started smoking setting off the alarms in my parent’s house. It was 16 years old and limped along for years. With a fridge full of food and potential shutdown of all non-essential business, I sprung into action trying to find them a fridge from 1200 miles away. I looked online and the major appliances stores were all delivering one week out. I called around and found a super nice lady at a big box store that scoured the warehouse for the cheapest fridge she could find that could be delivered asap. $1327. I promptly paid it and it was delivered the next day.   A note about my brother. In the past 5 years, he’s become a super christian conservative. Like the whole don’t talk to my wife except with me there to anyone in family type. Controlling and greedy. I think he follows Dave Ramsey to a T and thinks every man should provide for his wife/family including my dad. The If you missed your chance, “Oh well” type mentality. My brother lived at home through college rent-free, parent’s co-signed all his loans, and he never contributed anything even to groceries while he was living there. Over the years as stuff has broken at home, my sister and I have chipped in here and there and he has refused to.   I asked him to help with the fridge and he told me he’d call me in a couple of days with an answer. He calls me two days later and says the reason he will not help is because I failed to consult with him at all when the fridge broke. He would have wanted time to research and think about the answer. I said “pretend it broke now and we picked the cheapest new fridge for around $600, how much are you willing to contribute”. He said absolutely zero. He lives in a town subsidized apartment in small town Ohio while making over $140k with very little debt. I’m furious he will not pitch in and never has for anything. It feels like he has left our culture to one where you fend for yourself no matter what because God and Dave Ramsay say so. AITA?\n",
      "(Happened pre covid).   I'm 17 and had recently got a job at Kohl's. I was spending a lot of time working and saving up. My friend's (S) family is well off so she never really had to worry about money. I was trying to save up for college since my family wouldn't be able to help me at all. Because of it, I was working every weekend and after school if I could.   S' bday was coming up so I decided I was going to plan her a surprise party. She and another one of our friends were unhappy with me lately because I was working so much and not spending time with them. I planned to do a little bowling thing where our group of friends would say they couldn't come and then all be at the bowling alley. Well she somehow found out, and told me that she was busy that day and couldn't make it. Coincidentally one of my coworkers asked me to cover her shift that day. I figured that since she was busy, I would just pick up the shift.   Well S found out and told our other mutual friends. They all got pissed at me and told me I was being spiteful and petty for picking up a shift on S' bday. I know this is just high school drama but AITA here?\n",
      "Okay, bare with me here because based off the title I know it seems that like I’m a major AH.   So I (F24) have a husband (M26) and a daughter (F2) and we just moved apartments 3 months ago. Prior to this we were living at the same complex for 2 years, just on the lower level. In these two years we have never had any noise complaints. We moved to an upper level apartment because it was bigger and had an extra bedroom which we are using as a study.   Now let’s get into the nitty gritty. My daughter and I are both very sick. Because of this she woke up just an over an hour ago (3AM) and hasn’t been able to go back to sleep. So I brought her out to the living room and made her a midnight snack and put on her favorite cartoon. Usually she sleeps though the night, so this is unusual. Well every 20 minutes or so she would get up from the couch and sit on the floor closer to the tv, and then 20 mins later move back to the couch. Now she is sick, so she wasn’t running or jumping, she barely even has enough energy to stay awake.   Well after her 3rd trip of her switching spots, my downstairs neighbors starting banging on their ceiling (my floor) I let it go the first time. I lived in a downstairs apartment for the last two years, so I understand how frustrating it can be to hear footsteps when you are trying to sleep. But then 20 mins later my daughter walked back to her spot in front of the TV and they did it again, this time much harder. Now my daughter is terrified to even walk on the floor right now because she isn’t sure what just happened. So I got up and stomped on the floor a good 5 times.   Now I know that a lot of people hate living under toddlers, so I’m sure some readers are going to assume that this is built up annoyance that lead to this. But my daughter is 95% of the time a really calm child. We spend a lot of time running outside everyday so that she doesn’t have the energy to be jumping around all day. After the first month of us living here the same neighbors even thanked the landlord for putting “good, quiet neighbors up there”. These same neighbors even gave us a casual “threat” when we first moved in saying that they got the tenants evicted the last two times someone has lived up here for “being too loud”.  Now I’m thinking that I might be the AH for playing into these childish games, when they could just be having a bad night. At the same time though I feel that my child should be able to live in our home even it’s late at night.   TLDR: Downstairs neighbors banged on the ceiling because we were up at 3 in the morning so I stomped back after the second time.  ETA: I just want to clear up some things. Our apartments are designed the exact same way. This happened in the living room, so they didn’t get out of bed just to bang on the ceiling. They were in the living room and he had just gotten off work an hour prior. He usually stays up for a few hours after work drinking. I know this because every night he gets dropped off from a coworker and yells from his door to the parking lot where his coworker is and tells him to have a good night and that he is gonna “down this six pack and pass out”. After which I can hear him yelling at his wife or the tv, I’m not sure. Whatever he’s yelling at, I don’t ever hear a voice yell back. I only add this because people assume I have no idea what it’s like to have noisy neighbors when in fact I do.  Second ETA: A commenter pointed out that I should really add this. All of my surrounding neighbors have received dozens of complaints by this neighbor. My unit was vacant for a year because my landlord didn’t want to deal with more complaints. Landlord even asked repeatedly if neighbor would like to move upstairs so he wouldn’t hear footsteps. Landlord also pointed out to me that my neighbor was lying about getting the last two tenants evicted. They left at the end of their lease because they didn’t want to deal with the harassment from neighbor anymore.\n",
      "Okay so I already know I'm more or less TA here, but I just want to hear reddit's take on whether I'm a justified asshole or just a pedantic one.  So late last night, I was walking home from the train station after a long day of work. I was also carrying a massive box as I'm currently moving houses (it's been a long week). I was waiting at the lights to cross a very busy road in my area, however when the lights went red, a middle aged Karen decided to purposely overshoot the stop and deliberately park herself partially in the intersection in order to get a head start whent he lights turned green again, as the lane merged shortly after the lights. This meant that she was completely parked over the pedestrian crossing, making it harder for me to cross.  I decided that I shouldn't have to deal with that. So I crossed the road as normal until I reached her car. I put down my box, got her attention, smiled at her and repeatedly gestured for her to reverse her car so I could continue crossing (there were no cars behind her, so reversing was entirely plausible). I then stood on the road, staring at her and smiling uncomfortably and condescendingly until she felt obligated and pressured into reversing; all whilst screaming profanities at me. Once she had cleared the pedestrian crossing, I cheerfully smiled and waved at her whilst she continued to scream at me, picked up my oversized box and finished crossing the road. Although it was clear that I was doing this in a condescending way, I had not impeded any traffic during this, and during all this the people in the cars next to her were watching and laughing at the interaction. It was actually quite comical and I when telling my partner about this, he and I had a good chuckle over the situation.  I know I'm TA here, but I'm not even sorry. So Reddit, do y'all think this was a justified TA, or just a pedantic one?   Edit 1:  I previously described her as a \"white Karen\". Whilst she was indeed white, that was just poor wording on my part as I changed my sentence when originally writing it and forgot to edit it properly. Also just to clarify; it was clear she was parked over the lines intentionally. I see many people doing this to avoid getting caught in the lane merge ahead; however because of the intersection being a T intersection and the weird corner, I've seen my fair share of accidents caused by people doing that. I am normally a very passive person and actively avoid confrontation, but I felt that something needed to be done for both pedestrians and for safety.  &#x200B;   Edit 2:  Thanks for your views guys. It seems I did act a bit rashly, and dispite my valid concerns for safety, should have either ignored it or approached it in a different way. I'll try not to be so uttlerly insufferable for you guys in the future :)\n",
      "A few months ago I (22/f) got a new office job which started off remote first but I work more in-person nowadays.   Unfortunately I’ve met the CEO’s son for the first time last month and I’ve been trying to avoid him ever since. I can tell that pretty much everyone else is doing the same. The problem is that you constantly have walk on eggshells around this guy. He’s very opinionated and has a strong personality to put it mildly.   We had a conversation the other day during my break and he asked me what I’m into. Told him that I like all things creative and enjoy collecting art and visiting galleries. That was the end of the conversation……or so I thought.   Last week before I went into work my coworker texted me that the CEO’s son was running around showing people a painting he made(no he’s not a toddler, he’s only a year younger than me). At first I didn’t make the connection. When I arrived he came up to me and showed me this AWFUL awful painting, I’m not even sure what it was supposed to be? It looked like a dog or a small child. Anyway he asked for my feedback and I told him that it’s not that bad. He seemed kind of offended and asked me what I would give it out of 10. I told him it was a 4  at best  (and that was me being ultra generous!). He replied “wow, really? That’s harsh” and said that he spent a lot of time “perfecting” the painting. I told him that he can do better with practice and he told me that I’m disrespectful. Honestly his reaction was a little frustrating because I feel like he’s so used to being praised and I didn’t feel the need to do that.  So now word has gone around and my boss spoke with me in private about this issue. Apparently my actions were “hostile” and I should’ve been more careful with my words. I was even told that I should be “encouraging” of the guy’s artistic pursuits instead of being critical. And apparently I made all of my coworkers look bad too because all of them said the painting is great.   AITA?\n",
      "My (36F) best friend (42M) have known each other for 6+ years. I have been in love with him since the beginning, but he has never wanted a romantic relationship with me. I sort of accepted it and decided I wanted him in my life.  We became the closest of friends and we both are very important in each other’s lives to the point in which we talk almost every day, we tell each other almost everything, whenever one of us has a problem, we solve it as a team, like your problem is my problem sort of thing.  On birthdays we normally are together. For his birthday he normally goes to spend it at his parents’ house, and I always come along. His whole family loves me, and I love them all. For my birthdays we sometimes do a trip together (just the 2 of us) or even sometimes I have gone to his parents’ house to celebrate with them as both his niece and father have birthdays close to mine.  During the pandemic, even though we were apart, we talked regularly, and I can say he was the person who kept me sane as I spent most of my time home alone, isolated from the world. During that time, I told him a couple of times that I wanted to be with him, his response was that he wasn’t looking for someone else other than me and that he was happy with how things were.  About a year ago he started seeing someone else. I’m not gonna lie, I was heartbroken. I still am. But with time I came to accept it and I love him and want him to be happy. I have met her a couple of times since he wanted me to, but to be honest I try to avoid it as much as possible as it is painful and awkward for me to see him with her.  Now to the point. His birthday is in 3 weeks. Last month when we talked about it, I told him I didn´t feel so comfortable being a weeklong at his parents’ if he was going to be with his girlfriend as well. Judge me if you like, but I hate being 3rd wheel, plus parents’ house is a bit small for all of us. He was sad but he understood and dropped the subject.  Two days ago, he called me and told me that his girlfriend was not going to make it to his BD, he didn’t say it but I know he wants me to go. Now, I need to mention that when I decided not to go, I bought him an expensive present, the money I would’ve normally used to travel there as they live in another city.  I actually don’t want to go anymore for more reasons that I can say, but I feel like I would be TA if I don’t. So, would I be TA if I don’t go to my friend’s birthday even if he wants me to?\n",
      "I run a very small discord server for a very small fandom. I was 19 when this incident happened, but there are people of all ages in this server, with the youngest at the time being 14, and the oldest, \"K\" being a \"card-carrying adult\". They refused to disclose their actual age, but I do know they've been an adult since at least before I met them when I was 15.   One day, a new person joined the server. I was really excited, since the community was so small. They introduced themself, and put a link to their blog, which they freely admitted was \"chock full of incest porn\". I was in absolute shock, so I banned them from the server, and also blocked their blog. I personally find it morally reprehensible, especially since there are minors in the server.  I then made a general statement on my blog to please not interact with me if you support that kind of stuff. I didn't name any names, just a very short, one sentence statement. I don't like getting into major arguments so I was just going to leave it at that.  Later that day, I went on twitter for the first time in weeks, and happened to see \"K\" making fun of me for being sensitive. Now, that made me incredibly mad, especially since K freely admitted they never even checked the server anymore and didn't know the whole situation. But I figured, hey, that tells me a lot about the kind of person K is, so I banned them from the server as well.  The problem is that K and one of their friends were two of the biggest names in the community for producing art and writing. I've definitely alienated myself from both of them at this point, and I've received word from someone else that they still regularly shit-talk me on twitter (I blocked both of them on there as well).  So was I just being overly sensitive, or am I justified in setting boundaries?  EDIT: I should clarify that K was making fun of me for being sensitive over not wanting that kind of content in my server, which goes to show that K is totally fine with that content. That's why I banned K, not just because they called me sensitive.\n",
      "I (32F) live with my bf (29M).  I always knew he was a bit weird about illness.  I just never knew how weird until I moved in with him.  If I am even so much as stuffy, he freaks out.  Now, I don't expect him to want to kiss or hug me or anything, it's fine that he doesn't.  But, he makes me quarantine in the guest room if I'm even stuffy.  And if I can't quarantine, then he quarantines himself in our room.  If I have to leave the room for any reason, he insists I wait until he gets into another room away from me.   I know that he probably can't help it, but it just really bothers me that he treats me this way when I have even a minor illness.  I think he's been this way his whole life, but as far as I know, he has never been officially diagnosed with anything.  AITA?\n",
      "Me (15F) and my mom (42F) have been arguing about her not disposing of her feminine hygiene products. As in she leaves them laying out in the open, not in a trash can.   Most of the time I’ll grimace and pick it up with toilet paper, only occasionally I will tell her she left it out and she glares and goes to pick it up.   I’ve found used tampons wrapped in toilet paper on the shelf in front of the toilet, used pads(not even wrapped) stuck to this shelf, and a lot of bloody paper towels. Yes I said paper towels, when she bleeds threw and is to lazy to change she’ll stuff some down her pants and call it good.   Well today I picked up a bloody paper towel off the floor, wiped up a spot of blood from the toilet and floor, threw away her tampon wrapper, and her pad again! All in one day.   I mopped and scrubbed the whole bathroom 2 days ago and am the sole cleaner of it. If the trash is full and overflowing my family just leaves there trash on the floor.   So I told my mom I had just cleaned the bathroom and was trying to keep it clean. And she used the same old excuse, “I was in a hurry”  but she hasn’t left the house at all today. What hurry?! And still didn’t go to pick it up. So of course I left the room to do it and came back.   I told her that she constantly leaves her period mess in the bathroom for me to clean up and she called me a liar. But I haven’t been on my period in 2 weeks so all of this can only be hers. She’s the only other girl here.   I did say this in front of my stepdad, because they’re always in the same room and she said it was rude of me to do. But it’s not my mess and makes me wanna throw up. It’s also not like he doesn’t see it already as there’s only one bathroom.   I know it’s something everyone goes through but I don’t leave a huge mess after myself, I’m a big girl capable of cleaning my own messes.   So am I the asshole?\n",
      "Throwaway and names changed  I'm (22F) lead tenant in a house with Rose (23F), Chris (30M), and Katy (29F). Rose is a childhood friend, Chris and Katy are great. We do movie nights, concerts, family dinners, and holidays together. Rose and I have boyfriends who stay over sometimes. Chris occasionally brings a girl back to the house.  Katy never dated because she was working through some stuff, but she finally felt ready to try online dating. She had a few dates and eventually brought home a guy I'll call Jim. Jim lives with his parents, works part-time, and doesn't drive. Katy is career-oriented and independent. He's also more conservative than her (big fan of Ben Shapiro) while Katy is very liberal.  He came over a few more times, and soon, the drama began:   Katy, Jim, Rose and I were in the kitchen. Rose was wearing a bathrobe with a T-shirt underneath. The top of her robe started to open and Katy fixed it, not knowing she was wearing something underneath and said, \"Girl, your tiddies are going to pop out!\" Jim turns around and gets on eye level with Rose's chest and straight-up said, \"I wanna see boobs!\"  Katy said that Jim refused sex due to her body hair. He also talked about other women he found \"hot\".  Chris showed Jim a music video that included an \"androgynous motorcycle chick\". Jim made a \"joke\" calling the woman as a d**e. Chris was very pissed and cussed Jim out, ultimately kicking him out of the house.  Katy, Jim, Rose, and I were watching TV, and Jim started talking to Rose about her fitness. She left the room and he called out, \"Do you deadlift?\" She came back into the room to ask what he said. He replied, \"I asked if you lift? I've been wondering how you got that ass.\" Rose was shocked and left the room. Katy came and apologized. We told her it's not her fault, but that this guy is a dick and shouldn't openly sexualize her roommate in front of her.   After Chris heard about it, he told Katy that he didn't want Jim in the house. Katy agreed but continued seeing him. She says he's sweet when they're alone and wishes we could see that side of him. She also said that some of his medical stuff correlates with him being somewhere on the spectrum. I got that impression from him as he seems genuinely unaware when he says inappropriate stuff. It's great that Katy is compassionate, but she isn't responsible for teaching Jim this stuff.  Later, she confided that he stayed over again when Rose and I were at our boyfriends' places and Chris was asleep. Also, Jim went through her texts. She said they're a couple now and since we have our partners over, she should be able to too. I agree that it's unfair but he sucks. Yesterday, we had a house meeting and Katy said that she'll ask permission whenever she wants Jim over. Today, she asked, and Rose decided to stay at her boyfriend's.  Ultimately, Jim is the undisputed asshole, but I feel like I'm being too neutral. I am definitely a pushover and but does that make me an asshole?\n",
      "Throwaway account in case this goes viral- it would with my luck. On mobile, so I apologize if formatting is off.  I, 20F, had a couple of my friends over yesterday. We have been best friends since freshman year of high school, however we are all very busy with adult life crap so we only see each other 1-2x a year. We were getting ready to have a smoke session and watch binge watch our favorite TV show together when my mother (50sF) got home.  She had been out shopping and when she arrived, she asked my friend Kai (21nb) if they could help her with vacuum seal bags she had bought to put away a comforter. I was sitting right there next to Kai and would have been more than happy to help. I’m not sure if it’s her way of bonding with my friends or being friendly, but she does this almost every time I have a friend over. I have asked her in the past to stop. Kai came back into my room and said “please go help your mom before she turns me into a fucking maid.”  It was that moment when my frustration bubbled over and I confronted her, BEGGING her to please stop asking my friends to do stuff for her when I have them over. It is weird and awkward and Kai is very uncomfortable. She made it her business to talk very loudly over me and ask Kai if they are uncomfortable and of course they awkwardly said “haha no its fine!” Knowing they wouldn’t stand up for themselves as not to seem rude, I put my foot down and told her she needs to stop. It is entirely inappropriate and just WEIRD.  She called my dad in to help her instead, and since I was already there I tried to help her myself. I reached in to help hold the bag for her to put her comforter in, and she grabbed me by the wrist and pushed me away. She told me “I DEFINITELY don’t want your help.” The whole thing just killed the vibe and our smoke session just wasn’t fun. My friends left early and I honestly just laid in bed crying until I went to sleep.   I’m still incredibly hurt by the fact that she physically pushed me away- all because I stood up for my friend. I haven’t spoken to her since then and I really don’t want to, because I already know she’s gonna find a way to make me feel bad about it and I’ll end up being the one apologizing.   AITA? Do I owe her an apology?  INFO:  1.) Kai and my mom are not close. They barely know each other. We rarely hang out at my house, it has always been this way so my mom really only knows them through me talking about them. There is seriously no way my mom should have felt comfortable being that insistent when they literally had to ask me to please remove them from the situation.  2.) My mom has done this on several other occasions with other friends of mine- even ones I was having over for the very first time. It’s always stupid trivial tasks that have absolutely nothing to do with my friend or their presence in our home. It’s never cooking or cleaning or anything relevant to them being here, it’s always something just DUMB. She singles them out instead of asking me when I am right freaking here.\n",
      "I work at a vet hospital, and I'm on probably the lowest rung of the ladder there. Half my job is janitorial, the other half is restraining animals, walking dogs, cleaning cages, occasionally helping out in ER, etc. Most shifts are done with a partner, including the ones scheduled on Christmas eve and Christmas.   Over the weekend, I got mild food poisoning. I was drifting in and out of a fever and was running to the bathroom and blowing it up with pure liquid shit. I was so dehydrated and weak that it was hard to breathe or think and I could barely carry on a conversation. I went to bed and slept about 12 hours, with breaks in between to go to the bathroom. I woke up and felt much better, but very sweaty and tired. I got lots of rest and only had a headache for the entire day. Yesterday I worked a half shift at my other job and I started getting stomach cramps. I thought it was from my monthly so I took painkillers because I couldn't take it. I ended up vomiting up my lunch, and some blood. It was surreal seeing strings of blood come out of my mouth. I immediately left work and drank some pedialyte. I called out sick for my vet hospital job because I planned on eating rice, drinking water, and taking lots of naps.   I got an email addressed \"to all staff\", written in large red font, that anybody who calls out the day before, the day of, or the day after a holiday, will not get paid for the holiday. I feel annoyed because I can't exactly control vomiting up blood, and I was going to work on Christmas and the rest of the week, and it feels unfair to dock my entire holiday pay because I got sick at the wrong time. I dont know. I just feel gross about the whole situation. AITA?  EDIT: getting lots of concern here about the vomiting up blood. I had stomach problems not too long ago where I was vomiting almost every day. I sometimes vomited up blood. The doctor did not seem concerned. All tests came up negative, and all the pills they prescribed didn't work. They didnt seem concerned and never pushed for more tests. I stopped going to them and I made dietary changes to lessen the symptoms. I am not going to the doctor for this because they won't care. I have even gone to urgent care because I was vomiting up water, and they didn't even give me IV fluids. They gave me a pregnancy test and sent me home. My healthcare sucks.\n",
      "My (20f) 2nd year college. Had a fallout w my stepdad over not coming home for a long weekend. I assumed he was still pissed since he never reached out, and so when thanksgiving came around (and I decided to work on recovering from my ED, to which I’d relapsed in the summer, more), I worked w my therapist and texted my family a hard ultimatum that I wouldn’t be coming home. But I would see them for visiting my bio dad the week after—almost skipped that as well, but felt too much to ask after being a dick abt theirs.   (My bio dad is a psychopath/narcissist. I asked him to buy me a plane ticket while this drama was going down; he refused, instead harassing my mom abt being a bad parent. One of the major reasons she’s still so furious.)  Things blew up. Mom expressed I’d “betrayed her” like a “stab in the back.” They said not only did I prioritize my less important schedule over them, I also prioritize my shitty bio dad’s celebration over theirs. And said I was acting viciously and manipulatively “just to get what I want, without thinking of others.” Because that’s true (that I acted selfishly, though I didn’t have aggressive intentions), I agreed, and they latched onto how I “confirmed” I did it to be horrible, though I’d only agreed bc I was anxious and overwhelmed. They still seem to believe I did it to be terrible to them, and that I didn’t think of them at all when doing it. (Though I did. But I don’t see how my considering their feelings would change them.)  After, things were very tense between us. I debated cutting them off bc of their drastic reaction but couldn’t bring myself to. Stepdad had me call him once a week to catch up on things; mom and I only talked about financial things. I worked on recovering and even w all that stress started to love myself and fix my relationship w food.   Then corona happened. I planned on returning to campus though things with my family were so fucked up, bc I knew what staying would do to me. Whole fam is lowkey orthorexic. My stepdad and I talked a lot and he convinced me to stay, if not for fear of getting corona, then to fix things w my mom and him.   Since then I’ve been isolated. Have little autonomy. Had many more productive conversations w my family; we’ve become exponentially more open w communicating emotion, though they consistently hint at me needing to work to “fix things,” though I don’t know how to do any more since we feel mostly back to normal now...  But I’ve relapsed, harder than ever before. I’m snappish and depressed and isolating. My friends and boyfriend are worried, and I’m debating moving in w my boyfriend in August. That’s a WHOLE OTHER issue—if anyone has insight on how I might do that more easily, PLZ comment.   TLDR: AITA for trying to prioritize myself over my family in a selfish manner, and AITA for the instinct to just run and get away from them, even though things are much better with them now, just not so much for me?\n",
      "One of my classmates is notorious for never contributing anything during group projects and leaching off of everyone during tests, assignments, projects, etc. He is repeating the year for the third time, as he didn't have enough marks to pass the last two times. This is his final chance as he's been told that if he doesn't pass this time, he will not be allowed to restart his year.  We had a pretty big group project and as usual he had contributed nothing. I called him repeatedly and asked him to send in his content, as eveyone else had and only his part is missing. He brushed me off saying he will send it, and did not.  Today was the presentation, and I removed his name. My group mates agreed to it, so I wasn't alone in making this decision. I warned him I would do this, but he didn't take me seriously. He lost it and started saying his father is retiring and can't pay for another year of his tuition fees and that I have to add his name back because otherwise he would have to leave the university. I refused and we began our presentation. The professor asked us why he isn't presenting and I told her that he didn't send in anything.  The rest of the class said I was a huge bitch, that I had ruined his life and I had no right to be so cruel. He would probably have to leave the university now, if he doesn't make up for it by asking the professor for different ways to earn the required grade.  It's the second time I'm facing the same thing with him and I didn't have the patience for it. But AITA?\n",
      "My husband and I are selling our house. This is our first home and we have been here for 5 long years, but are ready to move closer to family and my new and only niece. We placed our home on the market not expecting too much excitement due to current situation but it had 3 offers in 24 hours. We accepted the best offer $3k over asking price and have an offer accepted on the perfect new home. After we accepted the offer the family that is buying our home kept asking if we would sell them this or that as they like our style and how things fit in the home. We said sure for the right price and continued to negotiate prices ror each item.  After about 3 things I said I was tired of going back and forth and just wanted to know everything they were interested in and I would give a price. They basically want everything except kitchen table, tvs and tv stand.  I gave a price for everything together and they accepted. We would have had to sell the Washer and Dryer anyway and I didn't want to ruffle any feathers to mess up the deal because we really want to move to this new home.  Here is where my dellima is.  About a week ago my mom and I were discussing the move and she brought up our guest bedroom bed frame, headboard/footboard. She gave it to us when we bought the home. Never mentioned that she wanted it back at the time of gifting.  She bought this thing when I was 12 (18 years ago) at a yard sale for $150.  I don't know if this matters but it is pretty ugly. Well she told me she didn't want us to ever get rid of it and to let her have it back if we don't want it anymore.  I didn't take that conversation into account when I agreed yo the deal and I don't want to jeopardize selling our home and missing out on perfect new home.  WIBTA if I just sell it?  I texted her today and told her about the deal and she brought up our conversation. I told her ot was part of the deal and she said OK and stopped texting me back.   I don't understand her attachment to it and she is definitely a hoarder. She has a 30x60 garage full of stuff she doesn't need bur can't get rid of.\n",
      "I live in a different country than my family, and recently decided after a rough few months to surprise my sister with a visit home the end of June. I was under the belief my brother would be making a trip to visit me later in July. After booking my flight, I receive an onslaught of angry messages explaining that he decided to visit me instead in June and by booking my trip for then I was ruining his vacation. I told him he can come beforehand or after, or even stay in my flat while I’m away. But my trip back home is timed for my sisters bridal shower I do not want to miss. He is still mad at me for not being flexible. AITA.\n",
      "so my girlfriend 23f and me 23f have been together for a year.   this is the most odd fight we have ever had.   so she is a dip scooper, so she uses a chip to scoop up the dip, meaning that the dip vanishes to quickly.  we do not live together and I buy the dip.   so I decided to tell her that it might be better if she gets her own dip so she can scoop as much as she wants.  she got mad and said she does not want to get her own dip. I explained that it can get annoying when I buy the dip and get non of it because you scoop it all up and she responded with.  but it's better when you scoop it, and so I told her if she likes it that way then why not get her own dip.  she got kinda annoyed and she left.  this all happened yesterday.   typing it out makes it seem so stupid but it caused a fight that I'm now super confused by.   AITA?\n",
      "let me give you the quick background story of how I ended up in this situation.  Me and my kids mother were broken up. She was living with her new boyfriend. He went to jail, so she was in a situation where she had nowhere else to go and ended up staying here in my spare bedroom.  when he came home from jail she continued to stay here, but she still goes to see him on the weekends, etc.  she comes & goes & talks to him on the phone all the time blatantly in front of me.. I tell her I don’t like any of it and I want her to move out. we had broken up but I never fully over moved on, so now seeing her come and go and boo love on the phone bothers me a lot. I ask her to leave and she doesn’t. This has been going on for about 6 months now.  the other night her boyfriend was apparently outside working on her car. She texts me that he is going to come up to take a shower because he had oil all over. I said no, nobody is taking a shower in here. me and this guy dont have a huge problem with a each other but we’re not friends either.) the only bathroom is also in her bedroom and I do not want them hooking up in my house. Them being in her room would’ve made me uncomfortable, so I told her no and she responds “Cool”. Our son was not here during this time.  20 minutes later they both come walking up the apartment steps.. I said “wtf are you guys doing”… she says ohh we need to grab some stuff. So I remain calm and figure I’ll give em a couple minutes. 5 minutes goes by and I peak out there and see through her cracked door that she is in there getting changed in front of him. I yelled that the both of them need to get the fuck out. They left pretty quickly then but not without her screaming at me and putting her hands on me, and screamed at me if she wanted him to fuck her back there then she will do that. she is literally the type of women who will test how far she could’ve gone in this situation until she is back there having sex with him.  She goes off in text messages telling me that I acted like a piece of shit & yea she lives in my house but I am not her father and I am an embarrassment to her, etc.  Am I the asshole for feeling disrespected? I am the only one on the lease. I pay all the bills, though she did give me $200 towards rent the past month. I allowed her to stay here temporarily and now im in a situation where I feel disrespected constantly and she will not leave. And now she’s at the point of bringing her boyfriends inside of here.\n",
      "My (23) Mum’s (50?) Aunt recently passed away from cancer. She was also my godmother, although she stopped having a relationship with me once I stopped being a cute little kid.  I  should  have had a relationship with her, I suppose, but life just didn’t work out that way. Lots of reasons I could point to but i remember at the end of the day we just had nothing in common. I still respect her and obviously was sad to hear she died, but i’m not so upset that I need to grieve.  My Mum on the other hand is pretty broken up by her loss. Especially because she died to cancer, which runs in my mum’s family and thus is a very sore point. Also her dying so close to xmas is just shit timing for everyone.  I want to be a good eldest kid and support my mum while she grieves, but I always feel so paralysed around grief- especially  her  grief, the way it consumes everything and everyone around her like a black hole. It’s overwhelming. I want to support her, but i need to take care of myself, too.  Anyway, after the funeral my mum invited me to go to lunch later in the week with my great aunt’s husband and adult kids, who knew me when I was a kid but I don’t know them. Can’t even remember their names honestly. I feel bad for saying that, but it’s true.  I‘m tossing up whether to  go or not and if i’d be an AH for turning her down. On one hand, going just for my mum feels wildly disrespectful to my own boundaries, and disrespectful to my great aunt’s family while they grieve. I also can’t get to the place they’re staying at on my own, meaning that I can’t politely excuse myself and go home when I inevitably become uncomfortable.  On the other hand, I feel like I might be an asshole for not going because I wasn’t able to go to the funeral (it was in a different state), and I haven’t had the chance to comfort my mum over her loss yet in-person. I’m worried she’s judging me for not being as sad as her or something. Also think my sisters are going (though my sisters live at home so they don’t really get a choice), and i’m worried that could be used against me to make me look like an AH for being the only child not to go.  So. WIBTA if I didn’t go?  EDIT: Thanks for the feedback everyone. I decided to go and I think it was the right choice.\n",
      "So I (20M) graduated from high school about 2 years ago now. Throughout my 8-12 years, I was part of my school's Speech team. I was heartbroken to find out that this was the last school year the team would be together. I am considering messaging my former coach on why I personally felt like the team was honestly doomed for a few years now.  For some background, the team is relatively new, less than 10 years. I joined its first year. The coach, Mr. F, was very good. The team became a national force in only a few years.   The first two or three years it truly felt like a team. Then, in my sophomore year, I felt things take a turn for the worse. We nearly tripled our team size overnight and a group of these became issues with their attitude. One girl in particular, HH, was super talented but also exclusive. I had been there for three years at that point and was feeling excluded as she quickly became my coach's favorite and her friend group became the favorite of the team. And indeed, I wasn't alone. Many of the kids who weren't part of this exclusive group felt increasingly ostracized.  And then my coach started getting super competitive. And HH became the core of this push. My teacher started making absurd rules that blocked us from getting to compete at tournaments without hours of work. For me, I ended up spending like 10-12 hours a week in order to be given the opportunity to compete in a tournament that would run from like 7 AM to 11 PM. Then he applied these rules to new kids who were in 7th grade. One time, he pulled 15 of them aside and told them to work hard or leave and all of them left. Many kids who were just starting out were feeling crushed by the workload and unwelcome by the \"successful\" members.   Another rule was that you had to stay until the end of the tournament, no matter what. This turned into was watching the successful members (because Mr. F prioritized us watching members of our team) every round and really just rubbing in the loss for the less successful members.  And then he came the tournament our school co-hosted with someone else. First problem was that a STUDENT was given charge of the tournament and she played favorites. The \"successful\" members were given comfy jobs. Everyone else was made \"runners\", which meant we were expected to run all over the building and do whatever was needed. My family and I also ran concession on Saturday. Oh and the school that we cohosted with? Useless, only reason we teamed up was so we could use the building. Coach was nice, but the kids were extremely rude. No matter how much our team complained, Mr. F didn't want to make a scene with our co-hosts and so all of us without comfy jobs suffered.  Sorry for the long story. I've never done something like this and honestly, I didn't know how much detail to provide. Should I reach out to him? Or should I just let the team die and mourn the thing I spent my high school years on?\n",
      "I am getting married soon. I have a Limousine which will take us to the church and then from the church to the city for bridal party photos.  My partner and I are paying for the limo and have already paid half the price as a deposit.  My nieces will be in the limousine for about ten minutes at the start of the day on the way to the church but then will join their grandparents as we go of for photos.  My sister and her husband who are in the bridal party too have twin girls (my nieces/ flower girls) Them and my Mum with out consulting my partner and I promised the girls they would be in the limousine all day and how exciting that would be.  My brother in law msgd me saying that they are excited now and I should change the limo to a 12 seater because they are looking forward to it now. He will pay the excess.  Now I don’t want to have 7 year olds in the limousine. I love my nieces so much but I see it as a time for the adults and the children might ruin the vibe.  I also can’t be bothered organising a new company for the limo especially because I’ve paid a deposit.  I called my mum and asked why she promised the girls with out asking me and my partner. Just for her and her and my dad to go on to call me selfish caring more about my bridal party than my nieces then texting me continuing to say I make it all about my self.  I feel so upset that this is is all about my twin nieces needs more than my own.\n",
      "So let me start off by saying why I think I might be the asshole. I think I’d be an asshole because... kids are kids. You can’t stop them from being kids, and I’ve seen my neighbors try, but I don’t think they’ve tried enough, and calling the cops may stress them out big time, and the kids too.  Why I want to do it: Because their kids are destroying my grills, decorations, and removing dirt while I’m away for a couple of hours  For context, my neighbors kids are 8 and 9, and every time they do it, I tell my neighbors politely. I’ve also talked with the kids personally and told them it’s really hurtful, and would be amazing if they stopped. It just happened for the 8th time, and my garden is out open, and due to some complications with my wife, I can’t put a fence separating it.\n",
      "Alright guys, Am I The Asshole?  My cousin is getting married. We had been really close up until a few years ago when we had a pretty bad falling out. We've started to patch things up, and invited each other to our weddings.  Hers is less than three weeks before mine, in a different state. All my available vacation time is caught up in my own wedding/honeymoon/ect. Any time I take now is another shift I'll have to add, potentially working the night before/morning of my rehearsal dinner.  I'm a nurse, so I can't take non-allotted vacation, especially since we're very short-staffed and the fall is a high-census season. I told her I couldn't make it based on these reasons. She got very upset. My fiance and I offered to go on a trip with her and her fiance when our finances and vacation times recover. She was pretty unenthused by this idea and told me not to RSVP no and to just figure it out.  Plane tickets alone are $500. I'd be going for one overnight. I would probably end up working the night I flew back. My round trip would be about five hours in the plane. As far as I know, she is coming to my wedding and is going to make a trip out of it by going to NYC during the week.  Am I the asshole if I don't go, or is she by expecting me to come despite my job and my own wedding?  Edits because a lot are asking about info on the same stuff:  Weddings are this year, hers the last week of October and mine the second of November.  Nurse vacation time, or PTO/ETO time: I gain 12 hrs (one shift) a month, but this time is for EVERYTHING (PTO). That includes sick days, vacation, and call-offs. I was part of a very shady department closure early this year, where I was getting called off for either a full shift or eight hours every week. Either I could get sent home without pay and get paid about half my usual on my check, or I would have to use my time. My entire department was told that the mandatory call-offs would be \"temporary.\" They went on for months. If a friend hadn't donated me time for my honeymoon as a wedding present, I wouldn't be going on a honeymoon. As it is, I can't call in sick for any reason anymore as I don't have the time. My cousin knows all of this, but actively didn't let me say \"no\" to coming when I tried to tell her I couldn't come.\n",
      "Background : Let's call her Susie. At the time, Susie [F17] and I [F17] met through mutual friends and she made it a point to become my friend. (Her words later, not mine). She constantly texted me after the time we met, telling me about how we should hang out. Cool enough. We become friends this way, hanging out and going shopping, sleeping over, etc.   Issue : Susie, outside of us physically hanging out, only texted me to talk about herself, ask for advice, talk about boys she liked, and rant about her shitty friends. Half the time, I wasn't even sure I agreed with her assessment of the actions of her \"friends,\" but I did my best to play mediator and console her when necessary. At this time, I had been applying for colleges and had my own busy schedule, so I told her several times that I really was busy and wasn't going to be very responsive. She said it was fine, but gradually started getting on my case about when we were going to Facetime. (This sequence of events repeats itself in various ways throughout the school year. Note: I rejected Facetiming with her often because it would take several hours since she would then share consecutive stories/rants/etc. instead of just a few). Eventually Susie sends me a long text message about how I'm not a good friend since I'm not there for her, and that she's always the one starting conversations, stuff like this.   The part where I'm thinking I was an asshole : I didn't honestly express that I felt the friendship was one sided at any point throughout this. At times, I did try to shift the conversation and update her on how I was doing, but it always seemed like it would pale in comparison to whatever issue she was facing at the time, plus she tended to go back to talking about herself. But that's the closest I got to openly communicating issues with her.  After she sent me this long text message, I was frustrated, and quite honestly a little relieved because it looked like she was giving me a way out, and I took it. I said that I disagreed that I was being a bad friend, but understood that I'm not responsive, and that in that case, we shouldn't be friends anymore. She said \"lol ok\" and a few months later texted me telling me she missed me, but I didn't respond, also working a summer job at that point. Looking back I realize me cutting her off seemed warranted and not out of the blue to my stressed teenage self, but I do see now where she would think I was being harsh and abrupt. AITA?\n",
      "For some context, my best friends sister has had a poor betta fish for two years, in a 1/3 gallon bowl without a heater, filter, or ever changing the water. I got him a new tank, (2.5 galls cuz she refused an appropriate size) and i went over there to change his water weekly and taught my best friend how to change it. i haven’t gone there in a few months because they told me they’ve been keeping up with the tank, but they recently asked me to take the fish home for a week while they’re on vacation. the poor fishs water looked like it hadn’t been changed in six months, half the water was evaporated, it was brown, there was fish poop and molded fish food everywhere, poor guy had fin rot, ammonia burns, atrophy, and was so depressed it wouldn’t move. i took it home, put it in a 5.5 gallon (until i can retrieve my spare 10 gal.) with a heater and a filter, and treated his fin rot. it’s been four days and he’s looking so much better, he’s active, his fin rot is almost gone, his colors came out, and he’s eating real frozen food instead of their $1 pellets. but i am deeply considering not giving him back to his owners, i don’t have the heart to let him back into that situation. the family might be pissed i stole their fish but the fish is in a much better place with me. my best friend said her sister won’t even remember he’s gone, but i’m scared she will try and fight for him back.\n",
      "My wife (29f) is the oldest of 5 siblings and her parents are in the middle of getting a divorce. Her father is almost non existent in her or her siblings lives, and her mom suffers from a neurological disorder that makes simple tasks very difficult and effects her memory.  When they were growing up, my wife had to take a very active role in raising her siblings as her mom was very limited in capacity and her father was not around much. Her siblings as well as her have described their childhood as survival.  One of her siblings (24m) has an undiagnosed mental disorder. He is very smart, funny, but is a little shy and struggles with confidence. He does not work, does little around the house, rarely showers or takes care of himself and spends most of his days playing video games. There is a girl he really likes, but she is not interested in him at this time.  His mom likes that he isn't super motivated to leave the house or \"grow up\". She nurtures a codependence between the two of them and enables his lack of motivation.  Over the weekend we celebrated his birthday, and I couldn't help but notice him putting in some (minimal) effort to impress this girl he is interested in. She was invited by his mother. In a brutal moment during a game we were playing, she made a comment that ultimately made it clear she was not interested in him at all and didn't view him as a responsible adult. It was not done in a mean way, but it was a crushing blow for him and for me sitting there listening and rooting for him.  I want to have a conversation with him about his future and his goals as well as give him some advice, but I'm concerned that it's not my place. My wife supports this, but I'm  worried that doing so will drive a wedge in the family.  WIBTA if I had this \"tough love\" conversation with him?\n",
      "So my friend claims they have insomnia but they stay up all night playing games and take multiple naps during the day and pretty much sleeps all day. They don't have a job or anything and it honestly makes no sense to me. But they stay up way past 6 am and then go to sleep so by noon when my kid is full of energy and running around her play area, their SO comes out to snap at my kid for being too loud cause they are sleeping. Am I the asshole for not telling my kid to be quiet? Not really sure what to say to them or about the situation but they are stubborn and claim they have insomnia but I've never seen someone with insomnia stay up all night and sleep all through the day. It just seems like an irresponsible sleep schedule to me.  We are roommates, their SO pays their part of rent, they don't work. And I don't understand how insomnia can let you sleep all day but not at night cause I have another roommate with the same problem but they sleep during the night and its just broken up sleep. And my kid is 2 which keeping them quiet all day while they sleep is not something I can do without just putting them in their room the whole day which I shouldn't have to do.  We also live in the city, which a park or playplace is about a 30 minute drive and my SO takes the car during the day since I work nightshift.  My friend knew I had a child and knows how they are and accepted that before we moved in. They never explained their sleep schedule prior to us moving in.\n",
      "Here’s some backstory. We will call my friend Mike. Also, I’m a female. Just clarifying.   Mike and I met when we were both in High-school, although I am a bit older than he is. We shared a class together and when I first saw him, I knew I wanted to be friends. I usually got that feeling when I saw people who ended up becoming a close friend. I love having friends, and ended up making some life long friends in middle school and high school. It’s been over 10 years since I graduated, and “friend zoning” wasn’t a big term yet.   I met Mike when I was a senior, and he was a sophomore. I was in a serious relationship at the time and had already been so since I was a junior. Things were going great at this point in my relationship, and life seemed to be great as well.   When Mike and I first became friends, I only ever had platonic feelings for him. We became fast friends, having tons of things in common and generally making each other laugh out asses off. I wasn’t the type to cheat or even emotionally cheat, and I should have spotted the signs that Mike was interested in me but I honestly thought he cared for me just as much as a friend.   Fast forward a couple years out of high school, and I had left my long term relationship. I had just turned 21 and wasn’t ready to be tied down. There was more out there for me to discover so I broke things off, and it wasn’t easy but I had good friends including Mike that were there for me. I eventually started dating... a lot. I never once considered Mike an option to date.   In my earlier years of school and after my 4 year relationship, I had quite a number of small time boyfriends. I liked to make out with boys but that was about it. Sometimes I would make out with a random cute boy at a party, even if I didn’t have feelings for him and wouldn’t even feel bad about it. I still never thought of doing this with Mike.   I had grown to love Mike deeply,  but only as a friend. Have you ever loved someone so much and wanted the best for them, but not in a romantic way? That was totally it. I genuinely cared so much for this guy. We eventually became room mates and this is where things got bad between us.   At that point we had been friends for 6 years already and no romantic connection between us. After we started living together, everything was great because we had amazing times partying with our friends, getting stoned or watching movies, going out, cooking dinners, getting drunk, all sorts of shit. We had crazy good times.   Until I started bringing over guys I was seeing. He would become cold and withdrawn, give me the cold shoulder, start acting like a brat pretty much. Mike also had one serious girlfriend while he was in high school, but nothing else after that. He never dated around like I did.   I found out why because he eventually confessed that he was in love with me and had been since high school. And as my heart sunk, I had to tell him I didn’t feel the same. Things were awkward after that since we lived together.   Eventually we moved passed that somehow and I got the impression he was over it.   Our lease ended and we decided to move back into our families houses, and for awhile it was still sort of awkward but then we started hanging out again more and more. I kept exploring the dating field and basically trying to live my life.   One night he was hanging out with me at my parents house, who he was very close to as well, and he basically erupted because I was talking about a guy I was currently seeing to my Mom. When Mike and I got back to my room to chill, he got mad and confessed he was still feeling the same about me and that it wasn’t fair that I never gave him a chance at love.   I was starting to get pissed off about the whole ordeal because I had never given him any sign that I was into him like that. No kisses, no flirting, no touching, and no leading on.. and here I am losing a great friendship that I valued, trusted and cared a great deal over. He didn’t think it was fair that I didn’t love him back?! When I never did????   Then he said this. “I should have kissed you when we first started hanging out. You would have fell for me. “   So I had to hit him with some cold facts.   “You and I never had a chance to start. I was already in a serious relationship when we met that lasted years after that. I grew to love you as a brother and I’m sorry if that’s not enough, but it will never be more than that. I don’t love you. “   He left my house, extremely pissed off and we haven’t been friends since. I think about him everyday. I miss my best friend so much but I understand if he can’t be around me. It hurts to be around the one you love, but doesn’t love you back. I wish him well still.   But I always wonder if I’m an asshole for how I handled things. I know I was being honest to myself but should I have looked deeper for those signs and prevented a 6+ year friendship from crashing and burning? AITA for never giving him a chance? I just don’t think I could have done that.    TL/DL: 6+ years of being just friends, Turned down male best friend twice, Walked out on after confrontation and truth being spat out. AITA for never giving him a chance?\n",
      "So I am a 16M and my 1st day of my sophomore year at high school started today, so I wanted to take a Nintendo Switch that I had purchased with my own money to play Smash with some friends at lunch.   As I was leaving to get on the bus my Mom asked me if I had the Switch in my bag. I said yes. She replied that I wasn't allowed to take it to school with me, saying that it would be a distraction from school. I was frustrated at the point saying how I had paid for the whole thing with my own money that I had earned and could do what I want with it. We got into a huge argument over it and I eventually caved and handed over the Switch.   Now as I am leaving school on the bus I'm second guessing myself and wondering if I should have stood my ground.  So AITA.\n",
      "Obligatory apology for mobile formatting.  Backstory... My MIL is currently staying with us for a week (we are following my countries regulations as most restrictions have been lifted)  She is lovely, she's a bit hippy and \"witchy\" which I don't mind, I love me some crystals as well. But, she believes 5g caused corona and is an anti vaxxer. She may be slightly autistic as well but at her age, they didn't believe females could have autism so was never diagnosed. She has a carer for other reasons so we aren't fussed about a diagnosis.   Here's the issue  She always calling my partner \"boy\" whenever telling him off or scolding him, or whenever she is being condescending (which is a fair amount let me tell you.) I have a serious issue with this, I have many friends of different races that use this term in a very derogative way, it's used to belittle grown men and this is exactly what I feel she's doing and I've explained these feelings to her, she hasn't stopped.  She has also refered to me as his \"Barbie\". I'm gender fluid and she knows this.   WIBTA if I told her to stop and really put my foot down on it this time? She's here for a whole week so I don't want it to be any more awkward then it already is with my firm moral and political beliefs.\n",
      "We have four kids: ages 11, 16, 17 and 21. We're also expats of 5 years (Sweden to Canada).  We've always lived in close quarters, we just couldn't afford an apartment with rooms for everyone. So our 11 year old daughter has shared a room with us for most of her life. We've always tried to quarter it off a bit with a separator.  Last year my two middle children (m/f) were deadset on going to \"High School\" in Sweden. My parents (their grandparents) live in Sweden and were willing to take them in. My eldest son moved out years prior, so that left just our youngest with us. At the time we were living in a three bedroom apartment.  When they moved out we let our youngest daughter have her own room, and she was ecstatic. This was her first time having her own room. After around four months, due to rent increases and since it was just the three of us, we decided to downsize to a two bedroom apartment. Our daughter visited the apartment with us and loved what would be her new room.  Shortly before we moved apartments (after signing the lease) our son (17m) had a change of heart about High School and wanted to come home. This was before the Coronavirus, but he'd been abroad for about 3 months and wanted to come home. Since he is the oldest we thought it'd make sense for him to get the second bedroom, and for our daughter to share a room with us again.  When this happened our daughter was upset, and requested to sleep in the closet to maintain her own \"room\". So that's where she's been, her mattress was able to be squished in there.  This somehow came up around a friend of a friend, and she gave me a look and told me that this was unfair and \"severely inappropriate\". I asked her what she meant by this, and she just scoffed at me.  Am I an asshole for this?\n",
      "I'm a 29 F and my husband is 28 M. We've been together for 7 years and we have an amazing relationship for the most part. We're in a good place financially and none of us really needs anything in particular, if we do we can buy it for ourselves, so gifts can sometimes get a little bit tricky.   I have never been into having the latest phone or piece of technology, I had my first phone at 12 and, since, I've had 8 phones total. I kind of get attached to my phone and only change it when it's absolutely necessary. He, on the other hand, loves having the latest appearance on the market.   My birthday is tomorrow and for the past month he has been trying to pick my brain and find the perfect gift. I kinda felt he was wanting to buy me a new phone, but I told him time and time again I don't want a new phone at all for my birthday, it's not something that excites me and my current phone is perfectly fine, no need for a new one. If anything, I said I would rather him give me something symbolic of us, that would get me right in my feels and would have been great.  A week ago he said he had found a great gift idea but he was unsure if I would like it (we tell each other everything, it's really hard to even keep gifts secret most of the time). I told him he knew me very well and if he thinks just for a second I wouldn't like it, I probably won't, and again, hinting he was thinking of a phone, I said I definitely don't want one.  Well, today, a day before my birthday, he couldn't keep the secret any longer and gave me my gift. A phone. I didn't react in a bad way, I just wasn't as excited as I normally am when he has given me gifts in the past, I thanked him and said that I just need a little time to play with it, right now it's definitely not what I was expecting as I told him specifically that I did not want a phone, anything but a phone, so I was a bit disappointed.   He's now upset at me that I'm not happy about the phone, but, for the first time in our relationship I feel kinda disregarded. The phone is great, I will definitely use it for some good years and love it, it's just that he knows me better, there were a lot of other options that would have made me so happy, and I feel like he just took the easy way out and just bought me something to buy me something, no thought went into it at all.   I don't want to be inconsiderate in any way shape or form. AITA?  LE: We talked and now I am excited for it. He DID have a reason for buying me a new phone eventhough I made it clear I don't want one. Recently I've been filming some tiktoks of our two cats and been having fun doing it (I didn't think he had paid a lot of attention to that, I was misstaken) and he said he saw that I was struggling with my older phone and a new one would be a lot easier and better for it and he was struggling with thinking about something more creative as he did in the past. I am very much happy now and in the process of setting it up!\n",
      "Trigger Warning: Suicide, Mental Illness  I get the part where it's generally wrong. I feel like in the situation it was kinda okay though. Basically, he has bipolar disorder and he's always moping around about everything and just in general he's always thinking irrationally. We were just talking about this thing on the news about a kid who committed suicide. That's where it kinda took a turn and he said that he can relate to them. I was already irritated because he changed the topic to something depressing like usual. He also just destroyed the mood. I regret saying it but we started having an argument about it and I was just trying to explain to him that he needs to stop talking about his mental health when he denies to take medication. It ended with me saying that if he's so depressed and if he hates his life so much, to kill himself. I caught on immediately and apologized but he was already hurt by it. He didn't reply to my apologies, he just left. I feel like an asshole but at the same time it's kinda true.\n",
      "AITA for making my friends pay for breaking my phone? This happened about a year ago but was recently brought up again by one of them. I take really good care of my belongings, especially my phone, a few months prior to the incident I left my phone unattended around them & when I came back it was on the ground w/ the screen cracked & no one would take accountability or even say if they saw who did it. Paid 200$ to fix it myself & continued on. 2 months later me & the same group were rough housing on the bed(not sexual) & I realized I couldn't find my phone, started searching & found it underneath 2 of my friends w/ the screen broken, I told them that they would have to pay for it b/c it was found under them & now the phone won't turn on, if I ever broke someone's property I would pay for it w/o even being told. It's how I was raised so I assumed that they would too however they both protested & said it was my fault for leaving it on the bed(we didn't plan on rough housing in the 1st place) & I should take responsibility for my own belongings & pay for it myself even though they admitted they broke it. I eventually convinced them to pay for it & it only cost the both of them 80$ all the while claiming that I was overreacting & being rude. It's been almost a year & I was talking w/ one of them about manipulation when he brought up the incident saying I manipulated the situation by making them pay for it & putting the blame on them. Their main argument was that it was an accident so I should have had to pay for it, am I the asshole for making them take accountability for breaking my phone?\n",
      "My sibling has a romantic partner that I really don't like, and they don't like me either. I've sort of begrudgingly accepted that they are in love with someone I don't like, and I'm perfectly willing to be civil, but their SO has on multiple occasions picked a fight with me.  They have argued with me when I found one of their jokes offensive, I have heard from other people that they have slandered me behind my back saying that I'm a horrible person, and have told strangers where I work and why I'm a \"c*cksucker\" I work in retail and today was Black Friday. It was extremely busy and I was even on register so I was working non stop. My sibling and their SO came in to buy something and before they left the SO approached me and excitedly told me that I was going to be their sister. So, they were now engaged. That news alone would not have made me angry, it was the fact that they told me in the middle of my shift on Black Friday while I was in the middle of checking someone out.  I complained about it to my sibling (because the SO has me blocked on at least SC and I assumed everything else too) and they told me that they did tell their SO not to tell me, and did tell them it wasn't cool, but complained that I always come to them instead of taking my issues directly to their SO and that they are tired of getting yelled at for things they didnt personally do.  This has been six months of tension in the making, and this is by far not our only issue (my sibling has also done some not nice things), but it is making me think if I've been treating my sibling unfairly because of how much I hate their SO. Maybe I am just subconsciously scared of confronting the SO and prefer to talk to my sibling? It's not like I have any reason to think the SO would even listen to me.  My best friend said that I was right to tell my sibling how I feel, but now I am worried that it wasn't right for me to go to my sibling as a sort of middle man. I want them to know how their SO's actions affect me, but maybe I took action when I wasn't thinking rationally.  TLDR: My sibling's SO announced their engagement in the middle of my Black Friday shift and when I complained to my sibling they told me to stop coming to them with complaints and talk to their SO  AITA?\n",
      "Mobile so hope this reads well.   For context my best friend is 27, but somehow never really grew out of that age where everything needs to be a lie. And she’ll lie about everything but lately it’s gotten worse...  After not speaking to her in a week, because of the constant lying, we have been shooting messages back and forth. And it all seemed good, we’ve been friends for years so I try to just put up with all her issues but as we were talking she started her spiral of lies again. She lied about what she wanted for her roleplaying character which seemed pretty dumb but whatever, but she kept going on wanting one thing and saying another and blaming everyone else for what she was saying.   I called her out and said she needs to stop because she’s making me question talking to her again, and she can just be honest as we’re suppose to be friends and she responded she doesn’t know how and is an pathological liar. I pointed out this just makes her seem like’s proud of it and unwillingly to change which she claims she’s not. This is where the conversation gets uncomfortable.   She told me she does this all for my approval, I told her she’s only getting my disapproval by not being honest and that I think the whole thing is stupid. She then told me she can’t lose me as a friend and that she needs me to fix her and make her more honest and a better person. She said she’s only going to lie more if I’m not around. I straight up told her that her tactics remind me of gaslighting and that she’s being manipulative and abusive right now.  She went on how I’ve made her feel worthless and toxic and how I’ve made her feel like she destroys everything she touches before removing me on social media.   Several alters have told me I was being unsympathetic because she was reaching out to me for help and all I did was hurt her feelings. I’ve been asked to apologise and told I need to reach out and be her friend again.\n",
      "Context: I (18M) have had to live with my aunt (47F) and cousin (21F) ever since I was about 7-8 years old. My younger 2 brothers (8M & 14M) and mom (43F) also live in the house as well.  My aunt and cousin have always been a hassle to live with. Both are lazy and despite having jobs, never help out with bills or anything money related. They instead spend their entire paychecks in less than a week and then complain about not having enough money for anything. They are complete hoarders and some of the messiest people I've met. My aunts room, for example, is buried in clothes. Literally, you are unable to see the floor and are piled so high it reaches my height in some spots (I'm 5'4, short I know). She makes no attempts to clean and instead talks about how overwhelming it is and how she wants to fix it, but then continues to by more clothes whenever she goes to the store.  I should also mention that at one point she was living in a different room and moved to her current one, cleaning up in the process, but then it immediately went back to piles of clothes that she doesn't wear.  My cousin is the same way and I share a room with them. It is unbearable as I despise things messy and unorganized, but when I bring it up she talks about how its so hard for her and blames her ADHD. Her and my aunt will also bring their mess to every other room in the house. At one point using the front room as their new bedroom essentially. Now they use my grandmother's room (she recently passed away and they wasted no time taking over her room). My room is now just storage for extra crap that my cousin can't fit in there.  My cousin is also an overreactive/emotional adult child who takes it personally if asked to do a basic chore of taking out the trash or feeding our pets (some of them are actually hers and not family pets). She acts as if everyone is just out to get her when she sleep all day and helps with nothing.  Not to mention both of them bring more problems into the house. Example, bringing in a new kitten that they couldn't afford and then making my mom pay the vet bills saying they'll pay her back, they have not.  My mom pays all the bills and buys all the food. I help where I can with money but my mom hates that I'm the only one willing to help so she refuses if I try to help too much as she's trying to get my aunt and cousin to pull some weight and not just us two. Its been this way ever since they moved in here. My grandmother used to be the one helping my mom.  I've expressed my frustration and told them they should just leave. I've also told my mother this as well. All think that's too harsh. My aunt and cousin have nowhere to go if kicked out and I doubt they could manage their money enough to rent an apartment.  Me and my mom  are seen as the bad guys in every argument we have over the mess and lack of help for my mom. Am I really being the asshole for wanting my mom to just kick them out?\n",

      "On my phone and English is not my first language.  So, when I was in my late teens/early twenties, I had a really hard time figuring out what I wanted from my future professionally. I got accepted at one of the top universities in my country and hated my course. I told that to my parents, and told them what I wanted to study. They let me drop out, but my father, who has a history of undermining me and making me feel insecure about my academic capabilities, ignored what I wanted and decided that I had to study Law.  I really lacked some backbone back then, so I got into law school (it’s a regular major in my country) and I was miserable, I hated it as much as my first course.  After two years, I decided to confront them, drop out again and go study what I wanted all along. My father was really angry at me, to the point I actually feared for my physical safety, but he only yelled. After he was done yelling, he told me not to expect any kind of financial help from him, and he also forbade my mom to help. I figured it was fair enough, since they had already supported me for a couple of years, and started working to support myself. Once I started university again, my mom felt bad because I was struggling and actually helped me financially. My father didn’t talk to me for a couple of months, and even after we reconnected, he wouldn’t talk about my career choice, to the point of leaving the table mid-lunch because I was telling my mom about a job offer I had gotten.  I did great at school, graduated and went on to get my Master’s in another country. Because I can only work part-time, they started helping me again (about 75% my mom and 25% my father).  My father and I no longer have issues, but that’s mainly because we barely speak. They got divorced a couple months ago and since then I’ve been trying to message him regularly because I’m afraid we’ll completely lose touch if I don’t, but he does not seem to care too much about my messages.  I’m now on my last few weeks before submitting my thesis, and I honestly don’t feel like thanking him on my acknowledgments. That’s not out of spite or anything, it’s just because I don’t even know how to do it without being completely fake. Also I highly doubt he’ll have any contact with it, he doesn’t even know what my research theme is.  Either way, I feel like not thanking him at all might make me TA, because he ended up helping me cover my expenses in the last two years, and he no longer makes derogatory comments about my career choices like he used to do. On the other hand, I feel like I got to where I am right now despite of him, not thank you him.  WIBTA if I only thanked my mom for helping me get where I am today?  (Also, not sure if this is relevant, but money is not an issue to either of them)\n",
      "For privacy, I am using a throwaway account and obscuring some identifying details.  &#x200B;  My father died a few years ago, in his fifties. He is survived by me (his only child), his ex-wife (my mother), his sister (my aunt), his estranged brother (my uncle), and his parents (my grandparents). This is the story of how my grandparents and I stopped speaking to each other after he died.  &#x200B;  My dad moved away from the deep south to the west coast to become an engineer. My grandparents still live in his childhood home. Grandpa is a retired railroad worker with a pension. (He used to tell me that he got that job when he was young by just showing up and refusing to leave.) Grandma is a homemaker.  &#x200B;  When my dad died, I flew out to take care of his body, his house, his work, and basically everything else, with my mom and step-siblings. My dad had always told me he wanted a Tibetan Sky Burial. But since that was illegal, cremation would do. He was into the \"deathling\" community and cheap, environmentally friendly treatment of corpses.   &#x200B;  But when I called my grandparents, they told me they wanted me to fly his embalmed corpse to them so that they could bury him in the family plot. I told them that it would be extremely expensive (I had to pay for everything out of pocket), difficult to arrange logistically, and an especially bad idea for my dad's body, which was found about two days after he actually died. Besides, my dad hated the idea of embalming and burying corpses. They begrudgingly agreed, but insisted that I \"bring him home\". I knew my dad hated that area, but I thought I could give them some of the ashes, then spread the rest someplace he liked.  &#x200B;  Fast forward about a week. I'm at my grandparents' house. They have arranged a Nazarene burial and published an obituary soliciting donations to their church. (My dad was not Nazarene.) I am getting ready to divide the ashes for them, when they start berating me for having him cremated against their wishes and not letting them keep all the ashes. I won't recount everything they said, but they kept asking, \"What about us?\" and telling me, \"We could die soon\" and \"The heartbreak you're causing will kill us.\" Eventually, I offered them all the ashes. They refused, saying I had taken him away from them. I just didn't know what to do at that point, so I drove off before sunrise and didn't contact them again. I still have the box of ashes because I just don't know what to do with them at this point. Am I the asshole here?\n",
      "This was a Few years ago. I have this friend, we’ll call him Tom, who I was close with for years, like childhood friends. Before he went away to college he started dating this girl, let’s call her Shelly. So when he went away to college, Shelly and I started hanging out and we really bonded. We became like sisters, going to the mall all the time together, going to movies. She was super sweet and it was nice having someone to hang out with. While Tom was in college, he cheated on Shelly. A lot. And when she found out she, understandably, dumped him. But she and I kept hanging out.   So one day I was at Tom’s watching a movie and I got a call from Shelly. I asked if I could take it and Tom said yes. However, he evidently thought I had meant another Shelly we had gone to school with. So when he realized I meant his ex he got really upset. I pointed out I had asked permission to take the call so why would he think it was the other Shelly? He said I can’t be friends with his ex it makes him uncomfortable and I kind of flipped out and said he doesn’t get to dictate my friends and that frankly he lost the right to ask me not to be friends with her when he cheated. We ended up in a shouting match and essentially it ended our friendship. I honestly miss him but I’m kind of a stubborn person so until recently I was very sure I was in the right here. Now I’m not so sure. What do you think Reddit?\n",
      "Okay so I’m a f (24) and my best friend, “Stacy” is also a f (24). I have been rooming with her since college, so about 6 years now. We really didn’t  plan  on living together after college but money was tight and we both didn’t want to live with our parents anymore so we got another apartment together. Mind you, we’ve been living together for basically 6 years. About two years ago I met my boyfriend. Stacy is very cynical about relationships. The last guy I was with was abusive and after we broke up she just kept saying things like “I told you so, I never liked him, I didn’t want to get in your way but I was right...etc”. So this guy though is the complete opposite. He treats me so well, and we can really picture a future together. So, boyfriends lease is up early u expectedly because his roommate m (26) had to move to a different state. My lease for my apartment is up in 2 months. We talked about moving in together and staying in the same area. If I didn’t get an apartment with him then he would have had to move all his stuff halfway  across the state to his parents house only to move it all back 2 months later. So we signed a place and I’m now paying double rent to avoid breaking my lease and fucking up my shit right. Stacy knows this and instead of being supportive she starts saying all this weird shit like “well my aunt and her boyfriend moved in together and they broke up 2 months in, so” “just saying one fight can lead to much more” and it got to me. I’m feeling so guilty that I moved out 2 months early. I still have some stuff in the apartment because it’s winter and it’s hard to move a lot of it right now but I’m paying for the space so I think that I have the right to keep it there. Recently my bf has been having night terrors where he is inadvertently hurting himself (banging his head into the door, knocking over glass on the side table) and I’m always there to wake him up and he’s fine. She got mad at me because I won’t spend just one night back at the place, when i told her I would once his episodes get better. I feel so bad for making her feel this way but after 6 years shouldn’t I be fine with moving on with my life? I’m struggling hard for money right now and she keeps bringing up her raises at work like I’m supposed to be extremely happy for her (I am) but it’s hard when she brings it up all the time and my entire paycheck goes towards my apartment. Oh, and my new apartment is 2 miles away from where she is and I live in the same complex as her cousin. Am I the asshole for leaving?   TL;DR - I’m moving out 2 months early from my lease with my roommate due to extenuating circumstances, and I feel really shitty about it.\n",
      "So a few weeks ago open enrollment started and my ex and I sat down to talk about coverage for my son.  At the time we were going to get him health insurance and no dental. But as i thought about it I was like “it would be stupid to not get him dental insurance.” It’s pretty cheep and with all his mouth issues (he’s 9 and went through a round of braces and now wears a retainer.) the cost of his future bills are going to add up.  And god forbid he actually needs work. A filling out of pocket can cost upwards of $400 around here.  Plus you need to be on most plans for a year before you get any orthodontist coverage. It just seems like the medically responsible thing to do.  I let her know I was going to in fact  get him dental coverage and that she was expected to pay her share 39%  or $18 a month. She is railing against it.  Trying to say I’m trying to get her to pay for my personal coverage (I’m not) and that he can get insurance next year like we previously discussed.  So I informed her that she was required to either pay her portion or provide her own health insurance as it stated in our child support order and if she doesn’t, I will file for contempt.  Now she’s attacking me personally like I’m doing something TO her when I only want her to do her job as a mom.  Am I the asshole?\n",
      "It’s a boring one, but I wanted outside opinions. So me and my friend were hanging out at my place so I could practice make up looks on him for Halloween. My mom comes home around 9 like she usually does. Shortly before she came home my friend and I got food. So while I’m eating, my mom asks me to unload the dishwasher, and I said “sure after I’m done eating”. So an hour later, my friend has to go home. However there was a mess in the living room from the food we ate and from some of the make up mess. So I cleaned for about another 30+ minutes. I forgot to unload the dishwasher. The next day when I wake up and I go to the kitchen, I remember so I start unloading them right there. There was only like 7 dishes in there anyway, so my mom comes in while I was unloading them and she becomes mad. Very mad actually, so I explained I forgot but I’m doing them right now, I’m almost done. So she starts yelling at me saying I do things on my own time. I tell her that I again forgot, and I’m sorry. She then keeps yelling and I’m also getting frustrated myself. So at this point I’m yelling too. I know it’s my fault for forgetting but she yelled at me for a few mins for a mistake. I was just going to forget about it, until she brought it up again today saying I was in the wrong, and when I tried to defend myself, she told me to shut up.\n",

She wanted to go to a restaurant a town away the first time, and when we got there we found that it was decently expensive. She still wanted to eat there, so we did. She wanted to eat there, so we agreed she’d pay the bill. About a week later, I invited her to go to a cheap burger place near us, and I payed for our meal. On the way home, we saw a new Chinese place and she wanted to order some noodles. I just got some ice cream and a drink, and I payed her back for the food I ordered.  Fast forward to a couple hours later, my father comes home and takes my keys, with him and my mother claiming I exploited and stole money from my sister. I told them no, we agreed on who payed each time but they didn’t want to hear it. Now I’m grounded until college starts, and I don’t feel like I did anything wrong. AITA?\n",

The other (4F) is perfectly sweet to humans, but doesn’t get along with other dogs very well. Beyond this though, my biggest problem with them is that they are not potty-trained and literally piss on everything.   I hate visiting my in-laws because everything smells like piss. You can’t sit on the couches because they are always covered so the dogs don’t pee on them. The carpets are stained with pee. The only room that isn’t covered in urine is my husband’s childhood room and only because he told his parents we would only visit if they kept his door closed at all times because of how many times we’ve showed up to wet spots on the bed. On top of that, my in-laws don’t take the time to clean these urine spots very well and will let them sit for hours or days on end before they get to cleaning them.  Anyway...  Every time my in-laws come to visit my husband and I, they want to bring their dogs. If they were trained, I would have no problem with it, however, I honestly don’t want to spend the whole time cleaning up pee. Also, because we live in a condo, keeping them outside the majority of the day isn’t an option and taking them out becomes more difficult with stairs involved.  Here’s where I may be the AH... This means that my in-laws have to board their dogs whenever they visit us, or need to have my husband’s brother watch them. Also, my in-laws allow us to bring our (fully potty-trained) dog with us when we visit them. They feel I am being unfair by not allowing them to do the same. I get it, kind of. But at the same time, I don’t want my carpet-covered condo to turn into a pee-stained mess. Overall, my husband agrees with me, but recently has started to feel bad about the “double standard” of not allowing their dogs when they allow our dog.   So, AITAH? Do I just need to suck it up and invest in some good urine cleaner for future in-law visits?\n",
      "I (22F) have two male kittens of three months old after almost a decade of wanting to have cats as pets but not being allowed because my younger brother is allergic. Now that I’m living alone, I finally could adopt them and it’s being wonderful.  Since I live alone (parents and brother living in another country) from time to time my grandparents, aunt, uncle and little twin cousins (7F&M) come to visit and stay a few days sleeping here, as they have to travel to get in the town that I live. My cousins always wants to greet, pet, pick up and play with my cats, always very excessively, even waking them up because they wave their toys in their faces. I always say to them that they should leave my cats alone, that if they want to play or be pet, they’ll get closer and they’re getting stressed with their behavior. But they never listen and when I get pissed off of saying the same shit over and over again, I say in an angrier manner and they start to cry, my aunt and grandma say that I’m being rude and I need to understand that they’re kids.  I love my relatives very much but now when they visit my house it’s being an annoyance and it’s stressing me and my kittens, they just don’t listen to my complaints. I’ve been thinking of not allowing they stay in my house anymore, at least, only if they understand how much this kind of behavior it’s affecting my cats.  WIBTA?  Edit 1: I’ve seen some questions about how I’m sure if the cats are stressed. They always get away from my cousins when they try to pet, play or pick them up. Fortunately they aren’t aggressive, but it’s very clear when they don’t like someone, not wanting to be close.  Edit 2: I put them in my bedroom for a few hours, but my cousins will always beg for me to see them and my aunt and grandma always get in discussions with me that they’re nice kids and love the kittens very much and do nothing in a malicious way. And a few minutes ago, they went to my bedroom without my permission to play with them (they were trying to sleep)\n",
      "I am a very religious man who has raised my kids, both sons and daughters to abstain themselves from sex before marriage. Boyfriends were not allowed until 18 years of age and the boy had to be a religious Christian also. The boy fits the bill, however I don't think it's a good idea under any circumstance for boys and girls to be in a room alone together without any supervision. As boys are very horny and often can't control themselves even when they try very hard. I would know this as it was the same for me when I was his age and I ended up having premarital sex which I regret so much. Because I know what it's like to be a young man that's very hormonal, I set a rule that they could only spend time together in my house, with the doors being wide open. It's my duty as a father to protect my daughter from damaging herself. She has obeyed all of these rules and hasn't shown any resentment towards it, which is why it shocked me to hear her say she wants to move in with her boyfriend before marriage. She told me and my wife she can control herself and her temptations to have sex and that we have nothing to worry about. I disagreed and told her it wouldn't work out, because I know from experience majority of the time when two people live together romantically they'll slip up at some point when it isn't expected. Then they would regret it the next day. She told us it's her choice and she's old enough now to decide for herself what she wants her life to be like. I responded if that's your choice then we will no longer pay for your college tuition. After that she just stormed out of the house and hasn't been answering any of our calls. My wife told me we should just accept her decision so we don't lose her. I do feel like I may be wrong for not thoroughly explaining my reasoning for not wanting them to live together, but I refuse to cater to her sinful behavior.   AITA for refusing to pay for my daughter's college tuition after she broke our agreement?\n",
      "Edit: Okay, I am the asshole. I accept that.    However, I have seen no convincing arguments about why Josh doesn't deserve to know before getting married, and everyone here has just disregarded his feelings out of hatred for my actions (fair enough).    Given that, I don't regret my actions, and will do it again if she doesn't tell her future partners before getting married. I am an asshole, but a necessary asshole.    My sister (30) is engaged to a guy (33), let's call him Josh. Josh is a very well established guy, very nice to my sister and our family, does a lot for us.  Josh and my sister announced their engagement a couple of months ago at a family dinner. Obviously everyone celebrates at the news and has a great night.... Except for me.  I took my sister aside  later in the night and asked her if she had told him about her \"past\". My sister went through an extremely \"sex positive\" phase in college and slept with easily over 100 guys (we're twins btw, so always been close). She said it didn't matter, it was the past, etc. Fair enough, it shouldn't matter, but I think Josh deserves to know this before he marries my sister. Not every man is comfortable with marrying someone with such an extensive list of past sexual partners.  So anyway I tell her if she doesn't tell him, I will. I give her a month. She doesn't tell him. Meanwhile they're going full steam ahead planning the wedding. I give her one last chance, a few more weeks to come clean, she doesn't.  So I told Josh all I knew about her sexual past. He thanks me, but doesn't take the news well. Apparantly my sister has been presenting herself as a sexually-shy kind of girl. ( edit: she lied and said he was her third sexual partner ). Completely blindsided him.  He's put the wedding on hold and hasn't spoken to my sister for several days. Says he needs time alone to think.  As you can imagine, everyone in my family is blaming me for ruining my sister's wedding (I guess I kind of did). Josh's family is kind of neutral, though they're obviously offering Josh emotional support and thanking me for my honesty.  AITA?\n",
      "Long read, tldr at the end. Throwaway because my bf reddits too  I (F24) and bf(25) live with my bf's parents. We've lived with them for a few years while paying off student loans and haven't had any issues. However, recently my bf introduced his little brother (6) to PS4 online gaming and got him set up with an account. Now the PS4 and TV are located in our room, I didn't mind at first because they only played together and usually my bf kicked him out after an hour or two. Now it's evolved to his brother playing as soon as hes home from school and occasionally my bf's cousins (around the same age) join in. There's times that I get home from my evening workout after work so around 7:30pm/8pm and his brother and cousins are still playing! On the weekend his brother is constantly bugging us to play and will wait outside our door or the bathroom to ask us. Anytime we leave my bf tells him he can play so sometimes we leave for hours and come back and he's still playing.   Now I've told my bf before that it's frustrating to constantly come home to kids in my room and kicking them out every day makes me feel like an asshole. Also, I play some games too so my game time has dropped as well. He understood and tried implementing stricter hours but that only lasted like a week. Now his little brother is acting very entitled and gets upset when I dont let him play which is at most 2-3 times a month (usually on the weekend) when I just want to relax in the room.   Now I had a day off yesterday and I heard his little brother complain to his parents that I'm hogging the PS4 and that it's not fair that he can't play today and I'm always kicking him off. I didn't hear their responses but that comment kind of pushed me over the edge. I called him into the room and told him I heard what he said and that wasn't very nice, playing the ps4 is a privilege and he's not entitled to play every day. Because of his rude comment he couldn't play today or tomorrow. He started crying to his parents, his parents haven't said anything to me or bf but I feel like I may have overstepped my boundaries?   I do feel bad because I remember how much fun I had playing games when I was younger but I feel like the kids are constantly in the room and my room is really the only private space I have in the house. So am I the asshole for kicking bf's little brother off the PS4? WIBTA if I restricted their game time to only a few times a week?   Tldr: Bf's little brother and cousins play the PS4 in my room for multiple hours almost every day. Am I that asshole for kicking them off the PS4 for a few days? WIBTA if I restricted their game time to only a few times a week?   EDIT: I do pay rent to his parents for the room and the PS4 is my bf's that he bought for me and him.\n",
      "Some backstory: My friend (let's call her Ashley) and I are both in an advanced school program, alongside a handful of others. We recently had an essay draft due and had it be peer-reviewed by others in class. I got Ashley's and noted what I thought she needed to fix or change within her paper. (A side note- her paper was unfinished and done the night before.  Here's the thing about Ashley; she's infamous around the school for being super stubborn and braggy. She has trouble admitting when she's wrong and only ever comes up with excuses, while at the same time always seeking validation from others. She's also been known for being pretty dismissive and mean towards other people's problems, but constantly vents to me and others about her problems.   Anyways, I looked over and critiqued her writing. The paper was very muddled imo, very hard to follow, and had very little analysis of the topic. And of course, there was the problem with her not finishing it, as well. I told her all of these, granted, a bit harsher than I usually am with her I guess.   She came up with an excuse for every single thing. Her paper wasn't finished because?? And her structure was incoherent because \"oh well Mrs thought it was ok when I showed her the outline\" (even though her outline and her essay were night and day). She refused to take any of the criticism I gave her and kept trying to make it seem like I hated it.   \"Just say that you hate it. You do, don't you?\"  \"Fine, I guess I'll redo the whole thing!\"  I eventually snapped and told her, \"Christ! Turn it in as is then! Just don't come whining to me about the zero you'll get because of it.\"  Now she's going around telling people how much I hated her essay and how I wouldn't take criticism??  I try to be gentle with her cause she's clinically depressed, anxious and works a lot despite being in high school, but I genuinely did not know how else to go about this. Especially since this essay is required for a full ride scholarship and she constantly complains about how her parents won't pay her tuition.  So Reddit, AITA?  TLDR; I told my friend everything I found to be wrong with her essay, and would up snapping at her when she kept making excuses. AITA?\n",
      "For those who don't know how the Indian railway works: Ticket checkers are super rare and no one checks your tickets and sometimes people don't even buy tickets. You can also buy a First Class pass which costs like 3-4x the normal pass and is essentialy a VIP pass(let's you skip most queues and sit in the First Class compartments). I usually buy it just because I get a pretty huge student discount and I didn't wanna deal with the morning crowd.   Since last week I've been getting people coming up to me and begging for money, I usually just ignore them but on Saturday some asshole was super rude and pulled out my earphones and kept asking me to give him money. Yesterday too two guys were going around asking people for money but today luckily a TC got on and she was asking people to show her their tickets. Those two guys were trying to hide near the back of the compartment, but after showing my pass to the TC I told her about those two and she went and asked them for their ticket, which of course they didn't have. She then fined them like Rs 700 and one of them actually started crying after paying her.   I didn't really see what happened next because I had to get down and it was kinda crowded, but my friend told me that it was a dick move to make   poor people have to give up almost their whole day's earnings just because they irritated me and that I should have just minded my own business. Tbh though I would do it again if I ever get the chance to, so AITA here?  Edit just because I didn't make this clear enough: A second class tickets costs Rs. 15 with almost no fines and the first class ticket costs over Rs 100. This happened after 4pm when the second class compartments are only kinda crowded and they would still have had enough place to squeeze in a seat\n",
      "First time posting here, and I'm on mobile so yeah.  Am I the asshole for trying to throw away a tattered book? I was at my locker at school, and I was getting ready to go home. I had a book that looked like it got ran over by a semi truck. I'm talking full on bent pages, highlighter marks all over it, etc. I'm walking by the trashcan, so while I was moving my arm to put the book in, I accidentally drop it.  No big deal, I just picked it up and carried on. Well, behold the lady I'll call Karen.  Karen:  yoinks the book out of my hand as hard as she can  Me: Hey- Karen: (very rudely) WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS? WHY DON'T YOU JUST RECYCLE IT OR GIVE IT TO SOMEONE?!?!?! Me: It's all tattered an- Karen: SO YOU JUST THROW IT AWAY? Me:  I left, and she kept the book that  I own.  I would have been fine if she wasn't so rude about it, but her tone was holy hell Karen-ish. It's my book, I can do what I want with it. In the condition it was in, I didn't think anybody would be able to use it. Am I the asshole?  Edit: I would have recycled the book if I had a recycle bin near me, I just didn't. Edit 2: The book was Copper Sun by Sharon Draper. Good book, I recommend it.\n",
      "So I'm not sure if I'm wrong or not but me (F26) and my boyfriend (M27) were planning a small vacation/ road trip around the surrounding states where we live in the Midwest to see the nature, go fishing and hiking, and just kind of blow off steam and finally spend some time together as the quarantine continues. The trip was supposed to take 2 weeks or so. I was expecting we'd go on the trip in a little bit, but then my job contract got renewed and I sort of thought it would happen a bit later when I could take a vacation.   Instead out of the blue, he tells me that he'll be taking that exact trip with his family plus some random cousins who live near him, but that I'm welcome to come along (a mere few days before departure). Now I have a disability that among other things makes me carsick easily, and I also have to use the restroom far too often. Generally, it doesn't ruin my life, but traveling with a large group (including his cousins and siblings) would make it very uncomfortable for me to have to ask to pull over a lot when I don't want to share my medical condition with his family, or really anyone. Plus I couldn't really leave after starting a brand new full-time job for a big firm. I got kind of upset that at the last minute he invited me to come along, and said he didn't know what to do when he told his parents about the trip we were going to take, and they decided to do it as a family trip. Obviously they can do whatever they want but we'd been talking about this duo trip for months, so I felt like I was cut out of something that was originally my idea.   He said he didn't know what he was supposed to do seeing as he lives at home just during the quarantine, and wanted to spend time with his family, and that his parents would be upset since he had worked abroad in the past for a couple of years and they missed him. I didn't think I would be, but I'm honestly pretty upset since I haven't had a vacation in years and I'm not exactly sure what kind of solo trip would be fun right now with quarantine. He used up most of his vacation days for this trip so he sure isn't coming with me, plus I don't really want to travel with him after this. AITA for getting pissed at him about this?\n",
      "Husband (m34) works full time, Monday to Friday. I work part time, one day a week and every other weekend.   I take on 85% of the household chores. I arrange and care for almost all child related responsibilities and cook dinner every night.   We split bills evenly.   On the weekends I work I expect the house to be kept tidy from Friday and I expect him to plan and make dinner for all of us.   He says that because he works all week and only gets the weekends off he should be able to relax and shouldn't have to worry about chores and making dinner.   (He some times helps throughout the week with dishes and tidying but it depends on his shift as he works swing shift. )  I worked this weekend and the house is now a disaster and as of 615 no dinner had been started.   Am I the ass hole here? Should I just leave him be to relax? I only worked there days this week.   Or is he the asshole who can't keep a clean house clean and provide two dinners for his family?\n",
      "So I (14 ftm) currently have a part-time job, , I got locked out of the house, it was in 90 degrees My grandparents were home so I asked to borrow their spare key, but this happens quite frequently, I have to lock the house up, so no one gets it besides my family. I've tried asking my mom for key ever since I got this job, but but she kept on saying that I'll just lose the key, but here's the thing I get locked out every single time, usually my grandpa's there, but recently, he's just been staying at his house, so I'm just stuck being locked out, I don't want to keep on borrowing my grandparents key, they need that for emergencies. What if my grandparents aren't home the next time I get locked out well, I just be stuck in the heat and until my mom gets back home? And if you're gonna ask no, my dad's not in the picture. My mom has the main key to the house and those are attached to her car keys, obviously, she needs to take her car to get to work, but I just know we're just gonna get in a fight about it, so I want to know, will I be an asshole if I ask for a copy of the house key? sometimes I do end up losing things, but I'm not gonna lose this\n",

      "I know, it's a pretty dumb question but i'm kinda concerned(don't repost, he has Reddit).  So my friend (H) and I have known each other since year 7. We're both part of the same friend group, so obviously we hang out and were pretty close. We're also in the same classes, so we also sit together in our classes. H originally had issues with controlling his emotions, and is extremely stubborn. He also strict, Asian, tiger parents and his relationship with them is sour (He's always cussing them and even admitted to wanting them dead). Me and my other friends often try to check on H (we've even recommended him to see a therapist) but he always says that he's fine and that we're jut overreacting.  But this year he changed.  Now, he's always misbehaving; hacking into his parent's email/bank accounts to delete detention notices and order things and whenever the teachers tell him to work, he'd either cuss at them or just lash out and storm out of class. Obviously my classmates see this, and they've starting teasing him. My teachers and classmates (Who've become sick of H's behavior/antics) have been putting pressure on me to regulate his behavior, so for his sake, I started trying to encourage him to do some classwork (Concentrating for an entire class is bit overkill, but I think that you should at least do some work in class), told him about how his parents will probably be shocked at his antics, etc. But whenever I did, it just pissed him off and he'd just say I'm a 'teachers pet' for working in class (Even though i just work harder in class so I can study less). I started taking some offense at his comments and I blew up and made a dumb comment about how he expects to do well when he doesn't even do anything in class and only studies cuz of parents, afterwards I did apologise and explained the circumstances but instead, he just laughed.  Now, H excludes me. When we hang out, H ignores everything I say and blocks me from our group. H now also refers to me as, 'fatass' and 'two-faced' and whenever I ask him why he's doing this, he says its because apparently I'm 'bullying' and 'discriminating' against him in class by telling him to do some work and that I'm not the nice person I use to be and am a fake friend. Recently, I also got a text from another friend, who told me that H started some group chat without me where he pretty much just complains about me, claiming that i'm just like his mum and a bad friend for making him stressed. That really hurt me because, all i ever tried to do was to get him to be more diligent so to hear this really made me question myself..  I'm starting to question why I'm still even friends with him, and I've never talked about this with my other friends (H is a lot more nicer to them). But at the same time, I feel like a jerk, he does have a pretty poor family life, so should I stop giving him more stress?  AITA for getting my friend to work in class and challenging his increasingly odd behavior? should I start being more understanding to him?\n",
      "I (25F) have an older brother \"Andrew\" (28M).   Andrew has been in therapy for at least 5 years due to various mental health issues. Andrew has trouble holding down a job because when he gets into a depressive state he will just stay in bed all day (regardless of where he's supposed to be).  I'm just saying this to paint an accurate picture of his mental state, so I can provide context to what's been happening recently...   For a few months now Andrew has had an \"online girlfriend\" called \"Anna.\" He sends her money, which I wouldn't have a problem with usually because he's an adult who can make his own choices in life.... however, my problem is that Andrew sends her money he can't afford.  My parents told me that Andrews spent all his savings on Anna and even sold his PC and his old gaming consoles for money to send Anna. He's dead broke and they've been sending him money just to make sure his rent and bills are paid and he has food in the fridge.  When my parents have tried talking to Andrew about not sending money on Anna he just \"shuts down\" and refuses to speak on the subject further. We're all worried this relationship is self-destructive for Andrew and he will screw himself over financially if he continues.   This is why I decided to reach out to his 2 best friends \"Ryan\" and \"Ben\". Ben works as a financial planner for struggling families and I thought he could help Andrew in that regard as well. They know about Anna, but they didn't know about the fact Andrew was sending her so much money. I thought if I reached out to them and told them about what's happening, they could actually speak to Andrew and get through to him.  But ... it apparently didn't work.  Ben and Ryan went to visit Andrew last night and staged an \"intervention\" type thing. Apparently things got very heated very quickly. Andrew kicked them out after like 10 minutes. Ben called me and told me it was a disaster and their friendship with Andrew is now on thin ice. Ben even said things almost escalated physically between Ryan and Andrew and he separated them.  Later I received a huge wall of text from Andrew complaining about me divulging details of his private life to his friends (all I told them was about how much money Andrew was sending Anna) and that he hated me and wished I'd just stay out of his life and not meddle. He also said I was shaming Anna and portraying her badly to his friends. He's also worried he's lost his 2 best friends because of \"my meddling.\"\n",
      "I (f22) have a niece (5) and nephew (4) that I babysit fairly often. This has been an ongoing issue between my sister and BIL for quite some time now. It all came to head today. I love my room to be damn near spotless. I’m a neat freak and hate any kind of mess. Now I know they are kids and they will be messy. I deal with it but I do expect them to clean up after themselves. Put away toys, throw out any leftover food, put clothes in the hamper, basically put stuff back where they found them. I don’t yell at them if they forget or anything but it annoys me greatly. I will kindly tell them to “please put that ball back in the basket after you’re done playing with it” and they have been listening to me up until today. Today I told the younger one to put his sweaty shirt in the hamper and he screamed at me “no” I admit I got annoyed but I told him again to put it away and he started throwing a fit saying “mommy and daddy said not to do anything you say” I was furious and asked the older one what he meant and she told me that her parents said they don’t do anything at home so why should they do anything here. I immediately called my sister and told her to pick up her kids. She came and asked what’s wrong and I said “you both told them not to clean up after themselves and not listen to me when I say to do something so I will not be watching them anymore” my BIL then said they are not my maids and this is child abuse and I don’t deserve “free child labor” I then told him that he doesn’t deserve free babysitting either and to “get the fuck out of my house”   They both of them have been trying to text me ever since but none of it is nice. Basically I’m a bitch and I don’t want to see the kids and I don’t care for them etc. AITA?\n",
      "I very recently got a summer job with a company that I’ve worked for before. Loved it last summer, but this summer I have a new boss. I’m giving as many details as I can but keeping it vague in case he is on reddit.   So, this guy has been leaving me alone on the job site a lot, and now is expecting me to supervise a trainee working with machinery I’m not very familiar with, after I said I wasn’t comfortable with it. I did end up putting my foot down and reminding him that I’d said no, and he didn’t take it well.  The last straw for me was the other day when he expected me to be comfortable on a 24 ft ladder when no one else was on the job site. I said no and he was incredulous as to why I’d be uncomfortable. Since then he’s been cold, discouraging, and told me that I need to “get comfortable with ladders if I want to stay with the company.” I feel like I’m well within my rights to refuse what he’s asked of me, but he’s making it out like I’m a huge inconvenience. I’m not even sure I want to keep this job because he’s being such a pain to deal with.  AITA for saying no?\n",

      "I'm transgender. My cousin babysits one of her friend's kids. She wanted to teach him about LGBT people and came to me for help since I'm gay and trans. I gather some family-orientated movies featuring LGB couples and/or transgender people as well as some movies and documentaries featuring serious topics pertaining to being LGBT that they can talk about.  I send it to her. She finishes it over 2 weeks. Calls me and tells me her son is saying he's transgender and asks me how she should go about his transition. I tell her he's just saying that because he's processing new information and he'll get over it. Inform her that when he's over and he says he's transgender I tell him he's not and he doesn't care for the next few days he's there.  She's enraged. Feels I'm invalidating him. Thinks I have internalized transphobia. Hasn't talked to me since. She's bought him dresses and wigs, but whenever he's over, he has no preference of wearing masculine or feminine clothing, isn't distressed when called by given name or masculine pronouns, doesn't bring up being transgender when he's told he's not and just goes on normally. I'm really confused about what the fuck is going on.  I've been trans and gay for over 10 years now. When kids are introduced to what that means some kids begin sporadically claiming they're gay or trans. For no reason. That's just what kids do. They get over it. Those that don't go on to be gay or trans, but taking it so seriously, and immediately entertaining it RIGHT after introducing what those things are? Yeah, typical kid shit. Not a big deal.  AITA? I have 0 insecurity with being gay or trans, but I have lots of experience with kids, and that's why I responded to her the way I did.  EDIT: My cousin just babysits. The conflict is between me and the kid's mom. Cousin isn't involved. Apologies for wording. The kid's mom was the one who wanted to introduce him and is the person angry.  EDIT 2: Kid is 5.\n",
      "I will try to be as short and sweet as possible. If y'all have questions about missing info, please ask. Throwaway.  My BIL is 36. My husband is 28. BIL has burnt bridges with every other family member due to stealing miscellaneous items and because of his attitude. He has a \"the world owes me\" attitude. Basically, none of his wrong doing is his fault ever and he always blames someone else. Including my husband.   So, since I married my husband 4 years ago this has been a battle. My BIL is always becoming homeless due to his own stupidity and tries falling back on us. My husband has this huge desire to be a good brother and always welcomes him in. Hes homeless this time because some chick he met off tinder (who wants nothing to do with him) needed a place for her and her daughter. He gave up his lease to her and became homeless because she wasnt comfortable with \"a stranger\" around her child. They have known eachother for 2 weeks.   He is paying the rent still, as she is unemployed at age 34 and never had a job. Like I said, his own stupidity and this has happened MANY times in the past. He blows hundreds and hundreds of dollars on random women and being their \"white knight\" (his words) and saving them from hardship.   Now, some of the money that he uses on these women isnt even his. He borrows money to provide for them. None of these women are sleeping with him. None of them want him romantically. Hes simply supporting 3 women right now and their children when he doesnt even pay child support or see the 4 kids he has.   Anyways, he apparently asked my husband if he could move in with us temporarily with the clause of \"This new woman shows signs of interest. So I just need to play it cool until she is comfortable with me around her kid and I can move back in.\" It's not going to happen. He cant even help with bills if he were to stay here because all his hard earned cash is being blown on those women he is supporting. So he expects to live here for free. I said no, for the first time in 4 years of marriage.   My husband said \"Its bizarre that you would drop everything if it were your sister but you expect me to tell my brother no. That's pretty one sided.\" Mind you, my sister is 14 and while I would drop everything for my sister, it's not needed. She has my mom. So the situation is completely different. He later apologized and tried explaining himself but I'm sticking to my \"no\" verdict. I dont want to continue supporting his brother. AITA?  The only reason I feel like the AH is because this is his brother and I know that he wants to help him out. After all, this is his house too and he has every right to be a part of the decision making but this has happened so much that I dont want to deal with it anymore.\n",
      "my best friend since high school and i were supposed to go on a camping trip about 4 hours away. when i reserved the spot, i asked if she could help pay part of it and she agreed but she didn't pay but since she's my best friend, i let it go because it was supposed to be our first time ever going to the smokey mountains and.. she's my best friend, the one person i could go to for anything and vice versa i thought . 3 hours before we were supposed to leave on the trip, i called her to make sure she was up, but no answer. i texted her about 30 minutes before we were supposed to leave that she needs to be up here so we can check in on time. she only sent back \"omfg\" but never did text me back afterwards. i've been calling her all day letting her know the cars packed and i had everything ready. she does not answer and even declined my calls. she's been posting on her snapchat story all day while i was calling her. upon cancelling the trip last minute of course there's no returned money so i'm out $200. i'm extremely pissed. would i be the asshole if i told her she owed me money for the reserved spot we didn't go to?\n",
      "My wife has never really been a clean person. She's very much the \"no reason to clean until its dirty\" type. Shes also super slow when she cleans, and doesn't do it all at once but over the course of several days. Because of this, the house always seems messy.  It was a freaking disaster these past few days and she finally decided to start picking up while I was in bed I guess. When I came out she had some of the house cleaned up, but there was still some dishes in the sink, the trash wasn't taken out, there was still clutter on the counter, and there was another load of laundry to be done. But she still acted all proud of herself when I came out and was like \"the house is looking nice huh?\" I told her it's still worse than what it should look like every day and she got all offended and said she worked hard to try and get it looking nice and I could at least agree that it is. I told her im not going to praise her for what she's supposed to do every day, especially when she didn't even do it right. She got pissed and said well if its not good enough for me I can do it myself, and went to the room and now won't talk to me or finish cleaning. AITA?\n",
      "UPDATE: I had a meeting with my boss yesterday. I was informed that said coworker was found cleared of any wrong-doing, however that I was on the verge of termination due to a multitude of claims that coworkers have made against me. My position has been moved to a sister center 30 minutes away from my home, and the next “mistake” I make will result in termination. I am BAFFLED to say the least. Thank you all for your input and kind words, but I have some things I need to process.  Let me preface this by saying I know it sounds weird. But I’m just entirely unsure about the whole ordeal.  I (21nb) work in a childcare setting. We have tons of kids throughout the building that have dietary restrictions. Be it allergies or veganism. There is a child in my room who has dietary restrictions that state that she does not consume gluten or cows milk. My coworker (F) does not like this child’s mom. She talks about how irritating and overbearing she is and how the child isn’t even allergic. (The mom has ceiliac and contamination from her daughter can cause a reaction)   The other day while serving snack, she served that child a snack that contained gluten. When I pointed it out, she told me to just let her have them because it didn’t matter and she wasn’t allergic. She does not act this way with any of the vegan or vegetarian children in the classroom. Only this child. So I reported her to the assistant director. Now she and our coworkers who are her friends are all mad and keep reminding me that the child isn’t allergic and it wasn’t a big deal. AITI?\n",
      "My dad's going through a crisis. Well....His whole life has been a crisis. He abused my mom for 20 years of their marriage. He was negligent to my siblings and I, going as far as spending money meant for our medical needs on dates behind my mom's back or to spite her.  He's notorious for making events such as birthday parties, Christmas's, and weddings the time to prove himself a gentlemanly scholar, clearly compensating for all the very bad things he's done, often pointing out other's flaws to make him seem great. In fact, the only times I can remember being complemented by him is when my success reflected positively on him as a parent.  However, he's made some breakthroughs recently. Naturally, he had a horrific childhood, one I couldn't possibly relate to. Let's just say it explains why he is the way he is. I'm a mental health advocate, struggling with self hatred all my life. I remember that I owe my growth as a person to people who included me despite me hurting them.  There's extra weight on me because I've been trying to help him be better. I don't really want the be that person, but I'm the only one willing. I guess there's something deep down inside me that believes people can grow up and that my family can go one evening without throwing things at one another.  He recently broke up with the women he rebounded onto who has children and a lot of other drama that I know is going to find it's way to my wedding. I guess he moved to another state, but I haven't talked to him since the breakup. I don't know where he is and frankly, I don't care. I'm not a spiteful or hateful person, but I turn into someone I don't want to be as soon as my dad is involved. I think it's a defense mechanism or something. I haven't forgiven him for manipulating, disturbing, and imprisoning my mother, who is the most kind-hearted and capable person I've ever known. She has accomplished so much in her situation that I often dream what she could have been if she never met my father.  Talking on the phone, I told my dad he was invited because I felt horrible not wanting him to come, but I really don't. I know I shouldn't have, but I did. I didn't even want a wedding thinking about what will happen as soon as my parents or siblings see each other, my family is a hot mess, and I really don't trust that they can keep it to themselves because they never have before. At my graduation, my dad wrote me a check addressing to \"the graduation embarrassment\" because I dyed my hair pink. I plan on my mom giving me away and I imagine he'll find that embarrassing.  My fiance was my rock when I felt I couldn't go to my family for help. All he wants is a celebration of our relationship and I know that shit will hit the fan as soon as my dad is within view of all the people he screwed over.  I see that I have three options: Tell my dad he can't come, never contact him to tell him when the wedding is so he misses it (the least dramatic but most cowardly option), or give him an opportunity to be a better man by letting him come to the wedding and mind his manners.  So people of reddit, what you got for me?\n",
      "My wife has  NEVER  been interested in cuddling, she calls it  suffocating  wheras I’ve always been interested in cuddling- so whenever I bring up the pillow my wife accuses me of being jealous of it, which is stupid.  (This is relevant to the story) my wife grew up with her grandparents, her grandparents always had a blue pillow on their bed, when wife was 16 her grandfather passed away - unfortunately from a rather cruel illness and not old age, her grandmother passed away a week after wife’s 22nd birthday.  Since the funeral, my wife has insisted we have the blue pillow on our bed, she’ll fall asleep holding the pillow too.  It sounds ok at first but it gets annoying because she doesn’t hold the pillow overnight and will often end up moving over to my side rather then sleeping next to the pillow!  I asked her to either put the pillow on the sofa or on the chair we have in our room and she’s calling me TA and telling me that I’m being insensitive   AITA?\n",
      "I used to have severe bulimia and I'm relatively skinny. My brother takes medicine for his bipolar that makes it a little bit hard to lose weight and is overweight. Once he started gaining weight, he started lashing out at me for my own weight as well as straight out fat shaming me just so he could feel better despite the fact that I've always been skinnier than him.   One day when we were at the mall he started throwing a fit because a dress that fit nicely on me didn't look as good on him in his own opinion. He screamed at me in front of multiple people insulting my eating habits, how I have no idea how it feels to be the weight that he is (despite the fact that I used to be overweight) and saying how everything comes so easily for me. He was fully aware that only about 3 months before this, I was in an eating disorder recovery program for 4 1/2 months. I snapped back at him telling him that his weight isn't my problem, that I didn't think he's fat but if he does then I cant help that. I then took off the dress and walked out. I know he has bipolar and sometimes its hard for him to control his reactions but he has always treated me badly for my looks. Later that day, my mom and dad shouted at me for hours about how I always need to support my brother no matter what he says and that as his older sister, its my job to take care of his emotions. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "I (36f) have a daughter, Lucy (10). She was not quite 2 yet when I divorced her father, Larry (40). There were many reasons. Firstly, he would  claim to be taking money from our account to pay bills, yet every single bill was delinquent. He would check the mail and hide the shut off notices. He was never able to explain what he was doing with our money. Also, I'd work all day to come home to my daughter in a dirty diaper, alone in her nursery while he sat around playing video games all day.   Anyway, I decided it was best for all of us to divorce. I've been with Lucy's step-dad, Thomas (35), for almost 4 years now and he is the only other man I've had around her. We are all very amicable tho. I've never brought her bio dad to court for child support, I agreed to handle it privately. Same with custody. She lives with Thomas and I fulltime. Larry is supposed to pick her up Saturday night and we would pick her back up Sunday by noon.  He has a history of canceling on her. For various reasons, concerts, baseball games, anything under the sun. He was doing well for awhile where he wouldn't cancel, until he met his most current girlfriend, Dolores (33).  Dolores has a 12 yr old daughter Erin, who she believes Larry should prioritize over Lucy. Anytime Lucy does go to their house, Dolores is very cold and unkind to Lucy. She purposely excludes Lucy. They rent a 3 bedroom house, yet when Lucy is there, she is forced to sleep on a loveseat. They did not bother to get her a proper bed and her own space. There was a time when Dolores and Larry were driving home with Lucy and Erin and went through Wendy's drive thru. They got Erin a meal and a drink. When Lucy told them what she wanted, they told her no, she can have something at their house like cereal.   Larry and Dolores have an incredibly toxic, co dependent relationship. Dolores has been fired from 4 jobs within a year. Larry hasn't had a car in about 5 years. So he is completely reliant on her car to get to his job. Neither can afford to live on their own. Lucy says they fight constantly.   She no longer enjoys being there. A combination of Larry constantly bailing on her to how nasty Dolores is has made her not want to go, not for over nights at least. She loves her dad and we do have an amicable relationship 90 percent of the time. But his failure to stand up to Dolores is starting to cause issues. I've told him Lucy does not feel welcome there and I refuse to force her to go if she doesn't want to. I would never stop her from going. But I will not force her to.. He says she's 10 and Thomas and I are AHs for basically letting Lucy make this decision on her own. So, aita for leaving this decision up to my child ?  Edit: For clarity. 1. Larry and Dolores have been together about 2 years now.  2. This is not a new development. I've been dealing with this for just about a year, when they moved in together. They originally said they got her a bed. About 2 months into them living there, Lucy told me they never gave her the 3rd room and has been resigned to a love seat. This is when this started. So it has been a long long time since Lucy has slept there, because she has no bed. This weekend, again I asked him where Lucy would be sleeping, did he get a bed which he had not. So again I told Larry that Lucy did not want to come. And he got angry and told me it is my job to tell her she has an obligation. Which I respectfully disagreed. So I've not been letting her sleep on a love seat.\n",
      "My (42M) ex-wife (44F) and I recently separated, we were together for 26 years (we met in high school) and during that time her parents became unable to care for her brother Brody (34M) who is autistic. Brody moved in with my wife and I 10 years ago, and while there was an adjustment period he lived with us happily since then. My marriage's deterioration was completely unrelated to Brody and was centered around my wife's emotional affair with a coworker.   When deciding what to do about Brody's living arrangements I stated that Brody could live with me, but my wife overrode me and demanded Brody come with her. I said I didn't think this was fair, because Brody is verbal, he stated his preferences were to stay at my house, his autism is fairly mild and he is capable of making his preferences known. My wife overrode him and took him with her when she moved out. However, since then she has called me asking me to come get him because he was giving her such a hard time, letting him stay the night for a few days, then a week, and now it's been a few months since he spent the night with her at her apartment.   I consider Brody to be my brother too, I've known him since he was 8 years old, I very much have a strong bond with him and I'd be fine if he stayed living with me until I was old and gray. My ex and her family are very unhappy about this situation, but my argument is and continues to be if they care about his happiness they should listen to his opinions, he is an adult, just because he has autism doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings and preferences. AITA for letting my ex-BIL stay against his family's wishes?\n",
      "Ok so I have a free period at my school and I share it with my mate and we play a game together and we were playing against each other and we made rules for what you can and can’t do. This means like no glitches no being mean if you are winning and he’s really bad at the game but he constantly breaks one of the rules no cheating for weaknesses. And I got annoyed cos I know them all and I feel like I should win but he always uses online builds we banned etc and he constantly hates losing but if you are winning you’re “ A Sweaty Bitch” and this annoys me. So because he hates losing he uses the banned builds and sometimes we do random I get angry cos the game is luck based and he’s quite lucky. And because he wants to win he uses bs tactics looked down upon by the whole community and he’ll tease you when he’s p48 ing you. He knows I hate feeling less than someone and I’m really good and he’s not exactly. He has to rely on bs tactics. So I today told him I hate the way he plays after he sleep, froze teed my team which we said we forbid so I got heated and told him he plays like a pussy and I know I’m better so you saying that you’re better then me pisses me off. Well he reacted badly. He got angry stopped talking to me. Started being really passive aggressive and played the victim even though he broke the rules of the competition we set many times in one session. Was I too harsh. I’m wondering AITA.\n",
      "Yesterday my friend(F15)and i(M15)made plans to hang out for the first timw since i moved away, i just recently moved into the city she's in. We were supposed to go to the mall at around 10-12pm and the plan was all set,our schedules were clear, and we were both excited.  Same night i told her to go to bed early.   So then the next day at around 11pm i started texting her but she wasnt online at all, and for the whole  entire  day i waited for her to text me back. Im not even joking, because ive missed her so much and really wanted to see her. But no. Nothing, she never returned to my texts UNTIL around 8pm. And she was pretending nothing had happened and as if she didnt leave me hanging. I didnt confront her about it cuz i figured she had smth urgent to do. Finally at 8:30 she texts me and i quote \"oh btw i fell asleep today thats why i didnt show up\".  Not even a single \"sorry\" in her sentence. I was so frustrated. I specifically told her not to go to bed late. She could've told her parents to wake her up. She could avoid this outcome in endless ways, but noo i guess i just dont matter enough for her to interrupt her dumb nap. Whatever, then the rest of the convo went like this;  Me:welp  Her:wdym welp  Me:welp as in i have no words for you  Her:wth are you dumb i just thought i'd tell you the reason why i didnt reply to your messages  Me:also the reason you ditched me.  Her:ditched you☠️?  Me:we had plans to go out today, remember?  Her:well the plan wasnt really set yet..  (it very much was btw and she confirmed that she would come)  Me:what..  i quoted the message where she confirmed it was okay   Her:well its not my fault that i fell asleep. You're exaggerating.  Me:atleast you could apologize.  Her:dont be funny☠️  Me:there was a lot of way that you could avoid that  Her:stop being dumb i set an alarm but it didnt work did you even read what i said im not gonna apologize for an accident.   Me:do you not apologize when you accidentally break your friends stuff??  Her:not the same thing  Me:yes it is?? You could've at least said \"im sorry for falling asleep and not being able to show up\" like what the hell get a fucking grip.  Her:i didnt apologize cuz you're being dramatic about it.  Me:im not being dramatic ffs we had plans and you fell asleep naturally im upset and on top of that you get mad at me for being upset?? You're acting so stupid rn  Her:because its not that big of a deal omfg  Me:I understand that it was an accident, im not mad because you fell asleep, im mad cause you cant own up to your fucking mistake for once and apologize for it. And it IS a big deal to me, i wanted to see you after so long   Her:well idc if its a big deal for you, it isnt for me, plus i dont have a mistake to own up to and apologize for just let it go and shut up  And then i just left her on read because my feelings are really hurt. But was i being too dramatic? Should i apologize to her for exaggerating?\n",
      "I don't have a great relationship with my inlaws, I've never really fit in with them and not for lack of trying.    It's got to the point where I'm polite and hospitable for my husband and children, but I don't go above and beyond.   Last year I had 20 of them all staying for Christmas, cooking all the meals, making up beds etc...    For the most part it went well, but I still had to hear a few sly comments from MIL and SIL about my food being cheap (it wasn't) about how the work i put in wasn't a big deal (i waitressed for 48 hours straight).   I was woken up at 8am the next day and asked to put breakfast on for them....  SO this year they are dropping hints about how I should host Christmas again.  I really don't want to either host or spend Christmas with them this year at all.  Maybe next year I will host again.   The problem is my kids want to spend Christmas with the wider family, and I want them to be happy.  My husband doesn't stand up for me but he is otherwise a wonderful man.  So what do I do?  AITA and being precious and self-centred?   Should I just suck it up as it's only once a year?    Even thought they're the assholes should i do it for my husband and kids?\n",
      "My best friend (22F) and I (23M) have been friends for over 10 years. We met in school and have been inseparable ever since. We’ve been through a lot together and she is my rock, my favourite person in the entire world.  Every year, for our birthdays we make sure to give each other a really thoughtful gift, even if it’s not an expensive one. This year though, we had a little rough patch and argued over something silly. We made up and I thought everything was fine! My birthday came and I traveled to see her. I wasn’t expecting a huge gift and honestly just a thoughtful $5 card would’ve been perfect, but instead she gave me two of the weirdest presents in the world. Things I never mentioned I wanted,or even remotely like, and I know she knows me, so that was a bit underwhelming. Of course I am grateful for the gifts but I can’t help but think that she still resents me for that earlier argument and that she did not put any effort in finding me a bday gift. I told two of my friends about it, one says YTA for being ungrateful, the other one says NTA because it’s not like her at all. So… AITA?  EDIT: She got me camping knives and a whiskey kit (I live in a big city and don’t like whiskey)\n",
      "Back in April (9 months ago), my boyfriend and I, who are both car owners, both needed oil changes. I'm generally bad at car maintenance, and at that time I couldn't remember the last time I'd gotten an oil change, but I suspected it had been a little over a year before. My boyfriend is relatively handy and an engineering student, and he planned to change his own oil and oil filter and offered to do mine as well. He bought new filters and oil, and one day changed the oil in his car. He planned to do mine as well, but changing the oil and filter was more difficult than he thought, and it took a while, so he decided to take care of mine another day. I told him it was no big deal, and if he didn't get around to it, I could always have a mechanic do it instead. From what I recall, the conversation never really ended with a definitive \"I'll go to a mechanic\" from me or a \"I'll do it for you\" from him, but I assumed that he would get around to it considering he had already purchased the materials to do it for me, and was willing to do it for free, whereas I would have to pay for a mechanic. I'm a student and I can't afford to pay for unnecessary expenses. My boyfriend, on the other hand, assumed that I would take care of it.  I didn't. It's now January, around the time my car would be due for yet another oil change, and it's been about 2 years since my last one. Today, while I was at a friend's house, my boyfriend changed the oil in his own car using the filter and oil he had purchased for mine back in April (our cars take the same filter and oil). I'm kind of upset, because he didn't mention to me that he was doing it, and if he had, I would have asked him to do mine as well. His perspective is that changing the oil in MY car is MY responsibility, and if I wanted him to change the oil in it, I should have asked him and he would have. He was under the impression that I would just go to a mechanic and get it done when it needed to be done.  In general, I don't expect him to take care of me all the time and look after my responsibilities, but he tends to be very thoughtful and attentive, so this situation is abnormal for us. However, I feel like he was a little inconsiderate, and now I'm kind of upset. He said he can still change my oil for me now, but I don't want to ask because I think he would have offered today if he really didn't have a problem with doing it for me. WIBTA if I got him to do it for me now? WIBTA if I paid a mechanic instead? And AITA for being upset?  EDIT: Since this is coming up a lot, to be clear, I have brought it up in the past 8 months, and my boyfriend was either too busy or the weather was too cold to change the oil. He knew that I had not had an oil change in ~2 years and that I had not taken it to a mechanic myself in the time since. Also, this is something I would like to learn how to do, and I expressed that as well as my willingness to help with the task.\n",
      "ATIA  Every time she has a problem, I present her with a solution, then she just lashes out at me, for helping her. Because I dont like seeing her stressed out and stuff. How is it my fault that I'm trying to help?  Example, her phone kicked the bucket, she doesnt have an alarm clock to use. I told her, set up the alarm on your laptop, her response was. I don't want to do that. (Well wtf do you want me to do about it?) I told her, let's stay on a call an I'll just wake you up through the call. Nope. It's like she just shuts down everything and blames me for it. Is it really a me problem? AITA?\n",
      "Background info: my mom married my step dad when I was two after my real dad didn't want to be a part of my life. Nobody told me he wasn't my real dad until I was 13 and my parents divorced shortly after.   My step dad and I never had a good relationship. He was pretty strict and could be mean. I could never really talk to my step dad. After the divorce, I didn't see him a lot and that's on me. I was a bratty teen and didn't really want anything to do with him. He would always try to reach out and we would maybe see each other once a year.  During my senior year of college we kind of made amends a little. Fast forward a year or so and I was in an abusive relationship. I needed to get out, but I didn't have a place to go. My step dad offered up his basement to me and I accepted. I was told that I would have privacy and be treated like an adult. I was also told that I could stay as long as I needed to get back on my feet.   I had a cat at the time, but he was worried she wouldn't get along with his animals. So my cat was locked in the basement all day and he would complain that she would cry.  On one occasion I was asked if I was doing drugs because he found a random pill on the floor. Then he found sleeping pills and lectured me on that because apparently he's against them (we're talking Zquil here).   One other time he opened my mail claiming he thought it was his. It was my birth control and there was a coupon for plan b inside. He sat me down to have a serious talk about what I was doing with my life because he thought I was ordering mass amounts of plan b?  He was also really weird about my dating life. I wasn't allowed to have anyone over because he wanted to try to have a father/daughter relationship with me again and he thought it wouldn't be fair if I was developing a romantic relationship downstairs. I would be fine if he just didn't want strange people in his house, but this answer was infuriating.  Since he wanted a relationship with me, I was made to feel bad if I didn't talk to him when I came home or if I didn't eat dinner with him. But I didn't want to feel like I was living back at home.   The biggest issue was that I was smoking weed. He is a recovering alcoholic and asked me not to smoke in the house or else it might trigger him. I complied and I would smoke in my car or at a friend's house before coming home. But this wasn't good enough.  So eventually after a month I was kicked out. I was forced to find an apartment ASAP and  had to get rid of my cat. I don't really remember this, but I guess I left a bag of trash there when I moving out and he actually drove it to my apartment and left it outside my door.  So now nearly two years later, we haven't had any contact. My mom sent me a message from him today basically trying to make me feel guilty. He talked about how he refers to me now as \"somebody's daughter that he used to know\" and how he finally got rid of everything that reminded him of me.  So, AITA for not continuing this relationship?\n",
      "I had offers on table so when a recruiter reached out, she knew she had to move fast. I spoke to their COO on Wed and then had several calls since. He told the recruiter they’re going to fast track my interviews to get me an offer because i was the “perfect” fit. My interest in it was average compared to others on the table. 3 of the interviews from this company were this morning along with a project last night. I was exhausted and brain dead from all this.   On my 5th and final interview, the CEO asked me after 15 minutes in if I have any questions for him - I didn’t. This was my 6th 30-60 minute call including the recruiter discover call. I stumbled and said “Not really… uhmmm … can you tell me about your day to day responsibilities?” - I don’t know. I just felt I had to come up with something and he never talked about himself in the first 15 minutes - it was all complex questions about my abilities.   He laughed and said “I think that’s enough, thanks” and hung up immediately. I told the recruiter and she called me in complete confusion why the 180. I’m thankful I’m not working there but damn, is this response actually justified? Could I be the asshole here for asking something he thinks is silly?\n",
      "It was my (16m.) birthday, mum got me a a few different things clothes and stuff and she has a thing were if you’re unhappy about a gift tell her and she’ll happily go back and change it.   So I tell her I’m not really a fan of the old man boxers and show her the kind if underwear I’d rather she buy.   She gets really mad saying how disrespectful that was and I need to learn how to appreciate something. I ask what she meant and bring up how she’s said in the past to tell her if I’m unhappy with something.   She says there’s certain gifts that are okay to ask to change and some are not. I ask her to explain that and give examples of a gift that’s okay to change and a gift that’s not okay and why.   She says I’m being rude for pressing her on it and at my age I should know the difference and should learn to just be happy with what I get.\n",
      "I (25F) have two younger sibs, Rachel (20F) and Noah (17M). Our parents marriage is awful. We all desperately wish they would have gotten divorced long ago. My dad is a sniveling, unrepentant, emotionally abusive asshole. Your classic Useless Man.  Mom was so stressed being married to him, she made a lot of bad decisions raising us. (Like, you know...not leaving him and trapping us with him too.) Rachel has horrible anxiety and Noah is extremely depressed. I became the Emotional Support Eldest Daughter, and while I have sympathy for mom and know it was hard and she did her best, it was also hard to be forced to listen to her complain constantly as if I could do anything about her marriage.  A little over a year ago, I moved out and got my own two-bedroom apartment in a neighboring state, and mom was super supportive. The distance helped ME loads in actually being able to talk to her, but my siblings haven't had that luxury.  I needled mom gently over the phone for her to finally leave dad. And she eventually listened! She decided to try and move closer to me, so I offered my tiny apartment as a place for them all to stay while figuring out the logistics of the move.  We agreed to let my siblings stay with me for about six weeks while she worked various things out. The move turned out to exponentially up stress levels, though, especially for mom, since dad didn't lift a damn finger to help. A lot of drama happened over the phone that I got dragged into, and I was excited to see my siblings and give them a space away from all of that bullshit.  The house finally got sold, mom found a new one to rent about 40 minutes away, and my siblings are living with me and it's super chill, if a bit cramped.  But now Rachel can't stand the idea of moving back in with mom in the new house, at least not so soon. Since all of the time sensitive elements of the move are done, I figured she could stay with me for an extra month so she doesn't have to deal with the stress of moving again on top of college classes, and said she was welcome to.  But mom flipped out. \"We had a plan, are you just telling me to stay all by myself in this 4 bedroom I got specifically for them? Why would you give them the idea that they had the option to stay longer? Nobody is talking to me. I did all of this with all of YOUR best interests in mind and not my own, why am I the bad guy?\"  Rachel and Mom can't talk to each other without screaming, and I'm acting as a go-between again. Rachel is 20, she shouldn't need permission, but she's still financially dependent on us. I completely understand needing space to approach mom at her own pace.  It's like Mom thinks none of these issues would have ever happened if I didn't try to suggest that certain plans she made could maybe be more flexible to consider Rachel's needs, but we did just kind of spring it on her without warning after months of stress?  Am I just being an asshole and overstepping?\n",
      "I live in England, but I'm originally from a Latin American country. Two years ago, when talking to mom over the phone, she commented her friend's daughter wanted to do a summer course in this country, but were having problems to afford it due to the price of the plane tickets. She said they found one at a really good price, but she would have to come two weeks before the start of her course, and they wanted to know if she could crash at my place. I asked my husband's opinion, he was okay with it as long as I approved of the girl first.   I said yes straight away, my mom's friend is really nice and I thought her daughter would be the same. I talked to her and warned her I had an infant son (back then he was 5 months old) and that we would be moving house around the time she was coming so it would be likely that her stay would be uncomfortable; plus, my husband and his family are muslim, so there would be obvious restrictions.  We moved to our new house a few days before she arrived, and our place was a mess, plus we didn't have a car because until then we didn't really need one. We had to rent one to go get her from the airport, which is two hours away, because she was bringing presents that my mom had sent with her, and I felt uneasy leaving her on her own.   She stayed with us for two weeks, I didn't ask her to help around the house because I could see she wasn't much at ease being with us. She wandered off to Spain on her last weekend here, so my husband and I went to drop her off at the bus station much to her dismay. On the way back she got in trouble with immigration and missed the bus back home, so we had to get her a new ticket and paid for her taxi, because she arrived at the bus station at a really late time.   I must add, before moving house, we didn't have Internet at home, we used the data from our mobiles but when we moved we realised our reception and our connection was rubbish, and we could see she wasn't pleased with it.   She left for London to go to her course, my husband gave her a charger and a phone,  because hers were useless without WiFi, we bought her train ticket and saw her off to the train station.  My husband said he didn't like her and he didn't rest until he found her on social media.  I was livid. She dissed, complained and made fun of us at every opportunity.   I tried to confront her and she only replied via WhatsApp messages, saying that it was her right to have freedom of speech and express her opinion in any way she wanted, I just called her a hypocrite and a liar because she didn't have the guts to at least say those things to our face. Her mom called to apologise but it just made me feel guilty and more upset.   Am I the asshole? I am aware her stay here was not very pleasant, but she was warned in advance  and she said she was ok with the situation.\n",
      "I kind of considered making a wider post on this but I think this one thing is better suited to the sub.  Okay, so, I (16f) have a sister (14f) who I had a good relationship up until we were 7 and 9. She was always eager to spend time with me. But I was always into spending time with her too. We got along really well. Then she started getting clingy and when I told her to stop and brought it up to my parents nothing changed. She got jealous of my friends. When I did include her she would try to hog me to herself. About 6 months after it started she pushed one of my friends over because my friend had my attention for a few minutes and my sister didn't like it. My parents grounded her for it but they told me I shouldn't have ignored her.  Except I didn't.  I just didn't give her my undivided attention.  I still spent time with her after that but when it was clear she would keep getting jealous and possessive I stopped letting her hang out with my friends.  Then over time I just stopped wanting to spend any time with her.  My parents have never let me stop though. They make a point of forcing me to spend at least one Saturday a month doing something with her and cultivating the relationship. And I hate it. I hate it because she is still so needy and clingy. I can't take my attention off her or she's like a toddler demanding to be seen.  My birthday is coming up in February and I have made virtual plans with friends. My sister wanted to hang out for some of it and I said no. My parents said I can't do that. I told them I would leave the house without her and walk around all day but my birthday is not going to turn into another day for her to demand all my attention. They said family is important and I told them healthy family is important but I shouldn't have to spend time with someone who demands it and wants my full attention always. I said I should be allowed to talk to my friends without her making a fuss, I should be able to trust that I can look at or speak to someone else and not have her become an emotional leech who keeps wanting more and more. They said it was a cruel thing to say.  I told them they should say that to my best friend when my sister told her to fuck off four months ago because my sister wanted to hang out with me and I was playing a game with my best friend.  I told them to say that to my friend she pushed who she still claims is an asshole for taking my attention away from her that day and getting into trouble. I told them I will not spend time with her on my birthday and if they try and force me I will take whatever punishment they dish out because I am not doing it anymore.  AITA?\n",
      "Every year at my(19M) church around february, we hold a talent show for anyone to perform anything. We have 2 seperate ministries, one for korean speakers (KSM, which pretty much consists of seniors) and one for english speakers (ESM, which consists of young adults, and families). The ESM makes up the majority of the church  We really set this event up for parents to let their children play instruments or songs, or sing, and for the ESM and KSM to mingle, but every year its always eaten up by the KSM seniors who sing these boring ass 10 minute long operas, or recite korean poetry they made, and sometimes instrumentals. They also leave right after the performances are done, which defeats the purpose of mingling  I recently got elected as an admin who looks over and schedules the acts. This year I was looking at the seniors that were performing and I saw that each of them were over 10 fuckin minutes, one of them was a 20 minute long performance of a bunch of classical songs on the fucking RECORDER by 5 seniors. All the others were just poetry and operas.  All the performances for kids were only around 3 minutes. Honestly, it isnt fair to the majority of these families, children, and parents to have to wait for these seniors to perform for that long so I cut every act down to 3 minutes to make it fair. Some of the elderly really pushed to get their full amount of time requested, so I allowed it.  That being said, the talent show this year will only go on until 9 (for the first time ever) instead of midnight, and all the childrens acts will be performed first so that parents don't have to deal with their children being tired and exhausted from sitting through every single performance.  The seniors were really upset, but majority ruled, so that was that.  At the performance, after all the children were finished, I noticed that a decent amount of parents and families were leaving, and all that remained were mainly just the seniors watching each other perform their acts.  the KSM is extremely upset at me for formatting the talent show this way and are actively trying to get me off the board as an admin (lol). Some of the other admins agree and are also trying to get me off the board too.  All I see is that I made a very successful show for everyone; the parents got what they wanted, and the KSM got to perform and leave like they always do anyways. AITA?\n",
      "long story short I'm the second oldest of 10 kids. I'm a (29) nonbinary lesbian and I'm not the only queer (2 of us are out to the whole family but there's more) in the family. Mom is Catholic. She leaned on the church a during times of stress and Jesus brings her a feeling of understanding and peace and all that. I'm much more on the side of church is an uncomfortable space and topic. She screamed at me for about an hour after I came out to her, but after that has honestly improved and I can tell she's trying. (it's been almost a decade.)  I get whispers from the other sibs that arn't out that mom has said she's struggling with her faith and her relationship with us and wanting us to be happy. I mentioned on the side about a 'friend' that mentioned some theology books to me that sounded interesting and if I liked them I could send them to her. She got excited because I expressed interest in religion again. The friend is google and a list of 'Jesus said its okay to be gay' books.   I feel a little bad about trojan horsing this to her. I'm not at all interested in rejoining the church and all of them will be Christ like love is for and to all. Love your queer kids. But at the same time I want to sneak this in to keep her from accidentally saying something and severing a relationship with one of my younger siblings and I think it would come across easier for her in a book.   so wibta?  (PS Dad is there. he's pretty chill about everything but backs mom up as he takes the 'we are a united front together and I don't undermine my wife in front of my kids' way of husbanding.)\n",
      "We were out celebrating my birthday and we played a game on which I gave a hint to a friend who has been with us since before we started dating. It was just for fun and I wasn’t thinking anything about it. I just gave her a hint. My girlfriend won the game BTW but apparently now it seems like I won’t stand with her in life and she is pursuing to leave the relationship. Did I do something wrong?\n",
      "Some context: I (29f) have been friends Janet (28f not her real name) for fifteen years. She is basically my only friend and we are very close. We have been very supporting of each other for years.  Janet has a bad habit of picking not so great guys. Her first child’s father has six kids by four different women and works as a pizza delivery boy. Her other child’s father and current partner, we will call him dan, has had his issues. When she got pregnant with him he was on drugs, then he went to jail for most of her pregnancy, and they’ve been evicted from an apartment already.  Janet is constantly complaining about dan. How he spends too much money, how he’s lazy, and how he doesn’t pull his weight. In the last few weeks it has been very persistent and it’s becoming overkill. It went from every other week to every other day. She talks about how she doesn’t like him, how unhappy she is, and how stuck she feels. They’ve both gained a super unhealthy amount of weight and they are having money problems. Her family and I don’t like this guy but it’s largely based on the impression she’s given us. She goes very back and forth about wanting to leave.   She told me today she went to the doctors and found out she was pregnant. She acts like it was this total surprise and she’s bummed, but I am not convinced. She has two kids already and she isn’t a young girl, she knew how this worked. I can’t help but feel like this was a “band aid” baby.   Janet and dan cannot afford another child and really don’t have the room for one. She wants me to come over today to talk about it but I’m dreading it because I don’t think she should have this baby and I think she was insane for putting herself in this position. AITA?\n",
      "So my girlfriend has lived with me for around a year now, it's my flat and she pays me whatever she can manage each month as she's a student.  For the last few months she's been asking if we can get a dog, I've said no every time as we already have two cats and it's quite a small flat.  &#x200B;  The other day her parents come over and take her away for a surprise, I obviously have no idea what the surprise was so I leave it and wait for her to get home.  A few hours later her and her parents walk in the front door with this rescue dog from a shelter a few hours away, at this point I'm in shock and trying my best to hide my feelings as I don't really want to freak out in front of her parents..  After a while her parents leave and I tell her I'm angry and upset and she apologizes saying she wasn't thinking because she was so excited, she says she's not going to force me to have a dog and will move back in with her parents if I didn't want it.  I was too angry to have a conversation with her so just left it for the night.  &#x200B;  The next day I'm willing to speak a bit more and tell her I want her to move back in with her parents as I don't want the dog and I also feel like she's disrespected me by going against my wishes, now she gets upset saying I've broke her heart and she wants to live here with me and the dog.  &#x200B;  She's now in crying a lot and saying the reason she wanted a dog was for her mental health as she's finished uni for the summer and needs something to do/take care of and apparently the cats are no use as they show no affection...  However she's been crying a lot and is clearly upset and now I'm feeling bad and wondering if I'm being too harsh..  Am I being the asshole here?\n",
      "So this happened several years ago but another post on the front page just reminded me of it and felt like sharing. At the time my sister and I were living together and had recently started dating a girl who at the time of this story we had yet to be intimate with each other (its relevant later).  i had been on a few dates with this girl and one evening after showing up at her place to pick her up to grab dinner she instead surprises me with a spread of dishes offering for us to stay at her place, saying “I made sure everything was vegetarian”. here’s was the problem, I’m vegan but never explicitly told her. based on dishes I had ordered or when I declined some fish she had offered from her dish she had assumed I was vegetarian. I politely told her I was actually vegan and she proceeded to become very apologetic and embarrassed saying I didn’t have to eat anything and we could go out, feeling guilty I told her no, that I would be happy to eat but jokingly added don’t be upset if I have to run to the bathroom. We ate and spent the evening on the couch with her asking me every 15 mins if I was feeling ok and when I left for the night she apologized again.  Skip forward to the next morning my sister and I are having breakfast when I get a text from my date again if I was doing ok being a little exasperated at this point because as it turned out I was perfectly fine and didn’t have any issues. I told my sister about the night before and how she was stilling asking if she had made me sick. To which she proceeds to called me a asshole for making her worry and ruining the night, that I should have not said anything ate the food because in her words “it should be mild enough to not be an issue” and if I really needed to I could’ve excused myself. She also mentioned that my date probably had made plans for me to stay the night, but I had ruined that and ended up stressing her out over what turned out to be nothing. While I could see her point, I thought she was being over dramatic but aita for unintentionally making a date worry because she cooked a vegetarian dinner instead of a vegan one?\n",
      "My grandfather passed away back in 2016. It really hit me hard. He was my closest relative. Closer than my parents. Fast forward to now his birthday would have been this month so I posted on my Facebook a post just talking about some good memories I have with him along with a few pictures. My mom proceeded to text me saying I needed to take it down because it’s “family business” (he was her dad) I said “respectfully no. This is how I remember him and if you don’t want to see it you can choose to hide my post.” I use my Facebook page as a journal and to communicate with my friends and family. No one is obligated to like my posts. They are there because they mean something to me. I post to a)get my feelings out and b) to get support from my friends and family who are not in my immediate area. Note that the memorial post was only posted to select Facebook friends as it’s still a hard time of year for me and I needed some support from them (everyone but my mom gave positive responses of encouragement)\n",
      "My girlfriend, who I moved in with last year, received some cutlery when her auntie passed away the other year. It isn't particularly nice or valuable but she likes it for sentimental reasons. I hate eating with these forks as the tangs are too close together and it really minimises the amount of food I can eat in one forkful.  I began hiding the forks in my work van, one every 3 or 4 weeks until they were all hidden. I claimed ignorance and that seemed to be going pretty well.  Anyway a couple of months passed by with me enjoying having properly sized eating implements when I gave her a lift in my van to work the on Monday she opened the glove box and found all the forks. She is quite upset due to the emotional nature of the forks and also that I would be dishonest about something so small.   The forks are back in the regular rotation now and I can feel the resentment growing and growing whenever I fetch a properly sized fork to eat my dinner with when she has knowingly set out a tiny fork to eat my dinner with.  So Reddit, AITA for hiding my girlfriend's tiny forks?\n",
      "TL;DR mother wants me to put tracking app on phone I pay for, so she can 'see if I'm using time effectively'.   I'm a college student and 700 miles away from home. Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n",
      "For some context, my parents got a divorce when I was two. My mom has dated a few guys since and she has married two of them. The one I'm talking about was the second guy. His name was Mark (not his actual name) and he has been an asshole for a long time. We have never really gotten along, but everything got worse during 2020. I had been going through a really tough time with ADHD and controlling my anger. I would never let out my anger and just hold it in because as a female, I would be attacked relentlessly. So every once in a while when I was having a bad day and when Mark decided to be an asshole, my patience would break and my anger would spill out. During these breakdowns, Mark would take out his phone and would film me. But recently I snapped. I was in the process of moving out and I had a lot on my plate. This specific day was super stressful and I went to go get some chips from a bag in the pantry so I did what most people do and put my hand in the bag and grabbed a handful of chips with my step dad watching me. The thing is, he has believed that I haven't washed my hands ever since I was 9, I was 19 when this happened. Anyways, Mark decided to point out that I grabbed chips with my hand. I was pissed off at the fact he got mad at something so small and slammed the door to the pantry before trying to go to my room to cool off, but he stopped me by saying: \"I should've recorded that.\" as he took out his phone and started to film me. I was fed up so I turned around and yelled at him. I said that I want him to stop filming my outbursts and that I have the right to my own privacy. He responded by saying: \"no you don't, this is the kitchen.\". Ever since, everyone has painted me as the bad guy and I don't know if I should've defended myself. So, Am I the Asshole?  Edit: Update, I just asked what he does with the videos and my mom said he shows her in a way similar to when you're arguing with your sibling and you run to one of your parents and tattletale saying: \"mom, my younger sibling just yelled at me.\"\n",
      "My boyfriend 24M and I 23F been in a relationship for like 10 months and been best friends for longer. He has been by my side since I broke up with my ex-husband, it was a really toxic relationship of 6 years and we have a kid together, he moved out with another girl making me believe he was working for our baby's future.  My boyfriend never liked anyone touching his phone which I understand it's his privacy but sometimes he let's me use it when my phone dies to just watch tik toks or memes on Facebook, the problem comes from a few months ago when he just out of nowhere started freaking out even when I look at the time on his phone or ask can i see some memes my phone is off. Have in mind I come from a toxic relationship I understand he isn't my ex but the fear it's still there I asked about it like what's with the sudden change and he just shrugs it off saying  he has always been like that.  A few days back I was taking my kid to school when I notice his phone was not charging he was asleep so I went to plug it so he had charge when he left for work and I looked and the screen to two different girls names on his phone. I didn't open it but did see the message of each girl one says \"hmm yummy🤤\" and the other one \"dream of me 😘\" I felt myself break I talked to him about it but he just said one was his cousin and they were talking about food and the other was just a friend and acted like it was nothing. I apologize for looking cause I felt bad for not trusting him but something in my gut tells me that something ain't right. Idk how to bring this topic again without making him mad or him thinking I'm just a toxic jealous girlfriend. So AITA?\n",
      "UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM   TA account   My (32F) husband of 7 years (32M) and I are pregnant. We have one previous child, Anne (6F, fake name) who has epilepsy. She has had 1 seizure before (relevant later in the story).  &#x200B;  To be honest, my MIL is horrible. She gives backhanded compliments, insults me and my looks and always tries to set my husband up with other people. The last time we went to her place she said she could make my husband a tinder account, or set him up with some girl who is the daughter of MILs best friend. My husband has told her to stop, but doesn't do anything else. News flash, she doesn't stop.   &#x200B;  When sending invites to my baby shower, I told my husband I didn't want my MIL there. He told me, \"since you're not letting my own mother be in the room with you when you're giving birth, you have to invite her to this. You should be grateful that you get a baby shower at all\". Also, he wouldn't even be at the baby shower, as he has something at work.   &#x200B;  At the baby shower, I was telling everyone how our baby was once again a girl. My MIL then decided to say, \"Wow another girl! Let's hope she's not like her sister\". I asked what she meant by that and she said, \"we don't need any other diseases in the family. Imagine seeing a new-born baby drop to the floor and shake everywhere. It's embarrassing\". At first I was honestly confused as she clearly had 0 idea what she was talking about. But then the pregnancy hormones really kicked in and I started crying hysterically. I left my friends house and my mother drove me home.  &#x200B;  Once I got home I saw my husband there. I didn't know why he was home and not at work but I just didn't stop crying. He said, \"where are all the gifts? You do realise how expensive some baby things can be\". I honestly couldn't believe he said that of all things so I decided to lock myself in our bedroom.  &#x200B;  About 10 mins later he tells me he got a text from his mother explaining what happened. He told me that I \"caused a scene\" and \"should be happy I got to meet up with some friends today\". I tried explaining how wrong what she said was and how she insulted our daughter and UNBORN baby. He said \"well Anne's epilepsy medication isn't cheap so I see why she said what she said. You just interpreted it wrong. Apologise to my mother.\" I packed a bag and called my mother to pick me up. I'm currently at her place and she's picking Anne up from school.  My husband and his family keep blowing up my phone and calling me a \"drama queen\" along with other hateful names so I need to ask, AITA?  Edit: WOW this blew up. I woke up to 700 new notifications so thank you all for your feedback. Just wanted to let y’all know that I am meeting up with my husband later today and we will discuss things. I  will  be showing him this posts and your comments. Also, thank you all for the kind messages and the awards too! However I don’t know what they do lol. Can someone please explain them to me? Thanks. See you soon.  UPDATE: ok so I’d like to start by explaining my username. My friend (who hosted the baby shower) suggested the name as a joke. When I showed her the kind things y’all said I also asked, “why do people think I’m suicidal?”. So I’d just like to say I’m not and my friend apologised if we worried any of y’all. Ok now to what happened  All of you were talking about how abusive my husband is. I guess I never realised it was abuse just because it wasn’t physical. I don’t know why I had that mindset, but I did.   I sat him down and started reading.  “You’re MIL is horrible” “Divorce this man” “Anne doesn’t deserve this” etc.   I explained to him that I wanted a divorce. We were in a public cafe so I knew there was no way he’d physically hurt me. This was how the conversation went after I said I wanted a divorce: Husband: “So just because a few strangers on the internet told you to do something, you’re going to do it?” Me: “it’s not ‘a few’, it’s thousands.” Husband: “It doesn’t matter who it is, you don’t even know them” Me: “Well you don’t know the chefs in restaurants yet you trust them to cook your food” Husband: “Shut the fuck up” Me: “it’s not my fault all you do is run to mommy and choose her over your daughter” Husband: “I don’t give a fuck about you or your opinion you fucking bitch” Me: “ha ok”  After that he stormed out of the cafe.  I think y’all would be glad to know that I emptied our joint bank accounts and took any valuables.   Y’all might think “oh that’s a happy ending to the story” but there’s way more.   So my FIL contacted me (which is weird we only talk at family gatherings and what not) and told me he apologises on behalf of his wife’s actions. He told me that she never liked me because I “stole him away” from someone called Melissa?Apparently my husband and her were together during college but she cheated on him. MIL however still loved her like a daughter. Turns out, all these years we’ve been together he’s been cheating on me with Melissa. MIL knew. FIL knew. Everyone knew. It explains a lot, like why he wasn’t at work that day. What actually happened was Melissa came over to our house and they had sex IN MY OWN BED. I was disgusted hearing it. I’m not sure how but she must’ve left before I came home. So basically Melissa told MIL and MIL told FIL. FIL said he regretted not telling me sooner and kept apologising over and over again. I was shocked and started crying. I thanked him for telling me and said I just needed some space.   However he also told me that MIL was telling a different story to what happened on that day (none of my soon to be ex husbands family was there so they didn’t know what happened) and that’s why everyone was telling ME to apologise to MIL. MIL told them that I started yelling at her for “wearing a better dress than me on my special day” and I “threw drinks and food on her”. (She made a mess of her dress previously so I’m guessing that’s what she used as ‘evidence’ lol). FIL said, “the woman really loves herself. In a couple of days I can guarantee you we’ll have  another  picture of herself hanging in our living room”. I laughed and said goodbye. I’ve also gotten a lawyer to sort out some divorce stuff.   I’ll give y’all another update soon. ❤️ Edit: second update is under my profile  Edit: to the people saying this story is fake, go ahead and believe that. Nothing I can say will change your mind so your opinion is fair. However, I don’t believe you need to be as rude as you were because I am going through a bit of a struggle. Thank you.\n",
      "First, Yes I know this post is stupid but I can’t tell if I was being rude or he was. Second, I’m sorry if there is errors I’m on mobile. A little bit of backstory Logan is kind of annoying and hates on popular shit like if any kid in school is popular he goes on a rant about how they are so bad and hates on popular games, Jonathan will take Logan’s side no matter what, and Lenny when it’s just me and him will say what I point. So it starts out with us in a XBL party playing COD Warzone Logan dies and rage quits everyone else continues playing. We are just talking about random stuff. While Logan is attempting to be funny by blasting kids music into the mic. I get slightly mad at the game and say  “I love this game sometimes.”   Then Logan starts saying   “The battle Royale genre is so stupid and basic.”  I say  “Logan you just hate on anything that’s popular, shut up”  Logan starts laughing and starts mimicking me to try to be funny while John joins him and Lenny of course just sits silently. I start bring up valid points while they are screaming the word Grau. It then gets brought multiple times and they make fun of me. So I start thinking did I do something wrong? So reddit I’m sorry this is stupid, but AITA.\n",
      "This is my very first post on Reddit, so sorry in advance for formatting issues. There will be a tl;dr at the end  My mom (65F) asks me(29M) if she could stay with my family in a different state. She wanted to start anew where we live and get a job as a housekeeper. I didn't really have any objections but we have an one bedroom apartment and our bathroom was in our bedroom so privacy was gonna be an issue. Plus our baby's stuff was occupying a lot of the living room area where my mom would be sleeping. It would be a tight fit, but our lease would be ending within a few months and we could move to a bigger place with enough room for everyone. So we said yes. We never set any ground rules because we're adults, should be easy right?  Weeks after move-in, my mom and wife are having issues. I worked full-time and my wife & mom were home together a lot. They would talk and bond, but my mom has made comments about how we lived, how my wife's tribe live (she's 25 & native american), what her grandson needs (8 mo. baby), etc. She would reference stereotypes about Natives like how they live poorly, drink a lot, doing drugs, piggybacks on their casino money, etc. My mom is Central American btw. My wife kept her feeling bottled up and she wasn't comfortable around my mom anymore. She gave me an ultimatum: fix the situation or she would stay at her mom's place and leave me alone with her. I told her I'll handle it.  Later that night, we started talking to my mom & everything was going well. But when it came to talking about her job searching, that's when it all exploded. My mom got a few offers for housekeeping jobs, but she didn't want to reply to someone because they're Mexican and said they're rude and dirty people. It got heated quickly to which I said she was a racist. She was defensive about it and said 'only for work purposes'. My wife chimes in, bringing up the things she said about her family and tribe, saying she's absolutely racist. My mom starts making a big scene, saying we're horrible people for having this conversation at night and that this is like we're kicking her out on the streets. She started packing her things into her car then left.  I've never 'kicked her out', she left on her own and never wanted to resolve the issue. She doesn't have family where I live since I was the only one who moved out to the southwest. I never told her up front that we were gonna talk about her comments, but I've privately talked to her so many times beforehand about her comments being a problem and nothing changed. AITA?   tl;dr : I confronted my live-in mom about her racism and after arguing with her about it, calls me a terrible person and was 'kicking her out' of my house because she didn't want to stay and talk about it.\n",
      "When i was 19  I wanted to get through college w/o debt purely off grants. Life free from debt defining my mom's life. Partly meant not leaving at 14  She convinced me to take a loan to help fix her car, since she can't take more & can't find the money herself. was skeptical, but needing to pay for transportation made sense  Before the loan came we argued over bs, she decided to remove me from the car on my way to school  I wrote a contract detailing conditions for giving her $. she would provide reliable transportation to school. Also a timeline for paying back  Next day she asked about loan. And didn't let me finish explaining that I require transportation before she had a fit about how expensive it is for me to live with her, how lucky i am to live rent free & how now she's going to start charging me for everything. & it \"would be so much worse if you lived anywhere else\"  I bought stuff i always wanted, + some things that would help with school  Didn't do anything or give my mom any money (already paid my own phone and already didn't eat most days). i left/cut contact. Had to drop out in the process  As a teen she liked to kick me out, hunt me down, and guilt trip me into coming back to help take care of her 4 kids* and make me apologize for every thing she took offense to  *(I was in online HS cause daycare is expensive & twins needed someone to stay home/take care of them all day for a few years. + housework/ dinner made by time everyone else came home. It was my whole teen life)  Resumed limited contact (3 years later), she expected me to apologize, admit how wrong i was to treat her like that & hurt the kids w selfish greed  Not too late to move back in. And how if i just didn't arrue with her in the first place my life would be so much better right now, and I'd have a degree, so please just apologize already so we can move on and go back  I got pretty mad about it & felt like everyone told me she was in therapy and doing better w her issues. I expected her to not pull this same thing the minute I started talking to her again. But she did  Family that was sympathetic to me before now sides w her and keeps pushing me to just apologize, esp cause dying  I tried to tell her I'll resume talking to her if she brings her therapist to mediate. After years of just trying to avoid sensitive topics, where she kept making subtle jabs at different things associated with trauma she gave me (like how i can't drive) and just doesn't seem willing to admit to her part in it or that it's anything but me being lazy. Claimed that I'm \"abusing her\" and \"wanting her to live in guilt\" and \"weaponizing Mom Guilt\"  Sometimes wonder if maybe the past tainted how strongly I reacted and how unwilling I am to capitulate  My therapist hasn't said much beyond i should figure out how much contact to have w family based on what I'm comfortable w and sticking firm  AM I the AH for not letting her have any of the money? Or is my entire family AHs? Or just her?\n",
      "Pretty much title and this isn’t the first time happening. So basically I’d have to pick her up after work at 7pm on Saturday so then l’d have to cancel my plans cuz of it. There is 2 solutions that she doesn’t wanna do which would be to either use Uber to get home or to go to my sister’s workplace and wait maximum an hour and then my sister would be able to drop her home.\n",
      "Title might be meh but here we go. I’ve lived with my boyfriend for a year, we’ve been dating for 2. He has 50/50 custody of his 5 year old daughter, which means we have her at least 2 nights a week every week and 5 every other week.  When we first moved in together I took over grocery duties as I like to grocery shop and cook, as well as I make twice as much as he does so that takes some of the pressure off him. But also when we first moved in together I was taking care of some debt and money was a little tight, so I made sure to shop smart and not splurge on unnecessary items.  Now that it’s all taken care of and we’re comfortable financially, I buy everything we need and also get anything special they both ask for. I make a point to ask if there are any special flavors or treats they want. I also get things for myself.  I don’t like a lot of snacks, so the ones I get are specific. I also don’t always want them immediately — for example, I’ll get a special kind of ice cream bar (as well as the ice cream bars they like and regular ice cream) and I could make my box of ice cream bars last for a few weeks since I only want them every now and then. But sure enough within a few days they’re all gone, followed by their ice cream. Mine always go first because they have their own but 3 people are eating mine.  Same for crackers, chips, fruit snacks. I get what I want and more than half the time they’re gone before I get to have hardly any. My boyfriend gets off work earlier than I do by several hours and picks his daughter up then so I suspect this is when it’s happening since I don’t notice it until they’re all gone.  I offer to buy them a box of the same kind FOR THEM and they always say no, they like their own. But lately the 5 year old seems to get a kick out of eating my snacks on purpose. She’ll tell me later “I ate all your chocolate chip muffins!” When she has her own blueberry ones BECAUSE SHE SAID SHE LIKED THOSE BETTER.  My boyfriend always apologizes and seems sincere; he doesn’t even seem to realize what’s happened until I point it out. No, they’re not unhealthy or obese, by the way.  Tonight I bought all the things I wanted and wrote my name on them and told my boyfriend (not his daughter, that’s his job), that those are MINE and if they want their own I can pick up more and label them. He’s been acting huffy ever since. AITA?\n",
      "first post on here, i was contemplating on even posting this but i need some sort of point of views.   So I (20f) started talking to this (33m) from an online dating app and honestly was very  attracted to him from the beginning. Well, fast forward 8 months (now) and we're together and everything is great. Well, mostly everything. In the beginning, i told my mom about him, not too much information just the basics of him. Then she asked how old.... I kinda froze but didn't make it too obvious and just blurted out that he was 28. I have no idea why but i just kept it up thinking he and I wouldn't have ended up together 8 months later. He knows that i told my mom he was 28 and not 33 and he seemed uncomfortable then kinda understood why i would lie about it.  But i feel like an asshole.. i mean eventually i wanna have him around family events and stuff, i just don't know if i could go back from that and it feels shitty.  Am I the asshole for lying about my boyfriends age to my family? Mostly my mom, who i feel like knows something is up\n",
      "This one’s pretty short.  For all my life I’ve hated having pictures taken of me, I’ve expressed this openly to my parents every time they pull out a camera on me.  But as of recent it’s become incredibly excessive. Every living moment I am in MUST be documented by videos and photos despite my wishes against it. When I protest I’m scoffed at and called miserable, happened again this morning. Wasn’t feeling great, was just in a dressing gown and they once again decide to pull out their phone. I complain and they pull the usual routine.  They always post in on Facebook and lie to me about it, saying they wouldn’t. Believed them until I unfortunately found out they would take pictures behind my back doing normal activities, post them publicly and I would be none the wiser until an old “friend” of mine was effectively stalking my activities on my parents social media. Really freaked me out.  Am I the asshole for refusing to partake in family photos, even if it makes me uncomfortable?\n",
      "I recently made some media discussing what I liked about a particular television series that wrapped up in the early-2010s.  While I did end with a recommendation to watch the show, that had not been my intention when creating it, but rather just to give my thoughts as to what I felt made the show interesting and unique (which by necessity required discussing the finale).  A lot of people seemed to appreciate what I posted, but I also received quite a few comments about how I should have included a spoiler warning. These made up only a small part of the responses and were mostly polite and never angry or over-the-top, but they still caught me by surprise and made me question my judgment.  I assumed anyone who would have been interested in what I had to say about the series would have already seen it and even though a spoiler warning isn't difficult to include, it never even occurred to me that one would be necessary for a show that old.  Deep down, I don't think I did anything wrong by not including a spoiler warning, but I recognize that just because I thought enough time had passed, my opinion could be wrong.  AITA, or are some people just being overly-sensitive?\n",
      "My mom (46f), my boyfriend (26m), and I(24f) are planning a slightly spontaneous trip up the east coast for the weekend. Mom’s been kind of down so   We’re visiting a recreational weed state and my boyfriend wants to try edibles with me. Based on my previous experiences with edibles, I become a little.. excitable.   So when we all discussed lodging I requested that we either all chip in for an Airbnb with two bedrooms or that we get different hotel rooms.   Mom got a little upset and asked why we couldn’t just get a 2 bed hotel room to which I replied that I’d like alone time with bf. She thinks that’s ridiculous because we’re all going together and “you don’t need to do things like that on vacations with family.” She went on about how it’s cheaper to split the cost of one 2bed hotel room than either of the options I suggested.   I tried to compromise by finding a hotel suite with multiple bedrooms but she wasn’t interested. After discussing with my boyfriend, we both agreed to split her food costs for the entire trip so she’d only have to spend money on the hotel (we’re providing transportation). That’s not good enough either.   My brother texted me an hour or so after the conversation with my mom and asked why I was being a selfish wh*re. He said I should just let mom stay in the same room as us so she didn’t have to be alone (???)   Y’all, AITA?\n",
      "So I ordered a lipstick for my sister as a birthday present, to me it was expensive and I spent over a quarter of my first paycheck on it (20€). I don't have a PayPal account so I gave my mom the money so she could order it. That was 13 days ago and the lipstick hasn't arrived yet (the site said 10 days). I checked if the site and lipstick was legit before deciding on ordering from there and it seemed all good to me. Today I asked my mom if she could give me the order number so I could track it and she told me that the site didn't ask for that information, meaning an email address I guess, and I told her that it did in fact. Then she said that she had deleted it and I requested that she would contact help and ask for the number which apparently didn't fly with her. She the asked why I wanted to know all of a sudden and started to yell at me. She said she would give me back the money and then burn the lipstick when it arrives. She says things like that alot. My stepdad then told me to fuck off and I did. This isn't the first time I my mom has ordered things for me that never arrive and also my mom lies constantly but right now I'm not sure if I'm in the right or not. I would like to know if I'm the asshole for doubting my mom and making a scene about this. Btw, sorry if the text is kinda funny, English is not my first language.\n",
      "My  15f  dad got married to his new wife/my new stepmom in January. They've been together since I was 11 and we get along super well. I can honestly say I love her a lot. My mom and dad were never married but to my mom, my dad is \"the one that got away\". When she found out about the wedding she asked to come and so I aksed my dad and stepmom and they both said \"sure whatever\". We came to the wedding venue and I got dressed my stepmom and step-grandma (???) And my my mom got dressed at her hotel. During the ceremony my mom started crying and got up to excuse herself. It didn't interrupt or anything but when I sat down with my dad at the reception I apologized to him and my stepmom.  They genuinely didn't notice or care she left and I think that pissed my mom off or something (she was at the table behind us and I'm sure she heard them say they didn't care). When I got home she was angry with me and said that I was a little shit starter and I should've never even have told her about the wedding and that this has caused her so much hurt. She said that I probably liked when my dad said he didn't care about her and told her she could come out of spite.  She sent me away with my father and I've been here since. I've been trying to talk to her but she called me an asshole for rubbing my happy new life at her and that I've shown my true colors. She doesn't want to see or speak to me and anytime I do she calls me an asshole for telling her to come with me.\n",
      "Long story short they are huge on family and are always nice to me and send me cards and talk about me like im family. And they always want me to visit. Wife goes alone instead. But fuck all that. I dont like them and i shouldnt have to go. My wife would like me there. But im pretty good on everything else except for this. As long as i am nice to them always there is no reason i need to go. When they visit im their tour guide and driver for everything. And i clear my schedule for them. But fuck going to visit them. If im gonna make the time to go somewhere. It sure as fuck wont be to visit them. My wife has told me she wahts me to go. But im there for her on everything else.Her family was rude when i first got with her. Like the first couple of days. After that they have been nice. But fuck all that. This whole \"You married into it\" is bullshit. You can love someone and treat them right without ever tagging along to visit any of their family.\n",
      "My intro computer science course had a competition in which you could win prize money. I assembled my group in a forum and didn't really know what to expect from my teammates. One of my teammates had some sort of disability and was almost always late to our meetings, but seemed genuinely engaged. I was pretty behind in some other classes and helped out when I could, but I was overwhelmed by the mechanism of our final project. This teammate started pitching what seemed like overly complicated ideas for a solution that I felt must have been easier, so I started consulting some dorm mates that had already taken the class to see what they had done. She didn't want to work with me on this strategy and just did her own thing. The plan was to maybe meet in the middle at some point. So two days before the deadline, it turns out she finished the entire thing. It was super elaborate and I couldn't really follow it. I tried to help debug it a bit and was always present during meetings to help, but at this point it was entirely beyond me. Anyway, turns out that our team won the competition, and all four of us won $100 each and got an A. After the competition she messages the group chat asking how much of the work we feel we had contributed. I was honest, and said basically nothing, (mostly because she didn't work with us on developing it). She then asked if we thought we were entitled to the prize money. I was so shocked by this, like, the team won, not you, this is just how group projects play out sometimes. She said she did it to help all of us out (one of our teammates experienced a tragic event during), and that it was rude of *us* for not offering. She then went on to point out the flaws in my proposed code and said it never would have worked. It was a draft!! She had to take a night off work to finish it, but none of us asked her to do that. AITA for accepting the money and not giving it to her?\n",
      "I (f19) recently tutored a student (f17?) through a tutoring website. Her mother (50??) furiously called and texted me today and we had the following conversation (literally copy-pasted, with identifying information taken out).  Mom (M): Hi (me), I’m (student’s) mother. I wonder why you charged the money for the first trial lesson yesterday. I claimed it was wrong to make me pay for you to (site). Back to the conversation we had through the chat. I talked to you about a trial lesson that shouldn’t be charged. See the attached picture!  The attached picture is a screenshot of where she asked me, “Are you available for a trial lesson?” and I said yes.  Loop: Hi! So my first lesson is backed by a good fit guarantee. If you or (student) weren’t happy with the lesson, you’re guaranteed a refund for the lesson. I’m sorry if there was any miscommunication, but that’s what I thought you meant by a trial lesson.  This is where I feel like I might be in the wrong. I honestly was confused about what a “trial lesson” meant, because she didn’t put free in front of it. However, this might be totally my mistake.  M: We were not satisfied by your lesson at all. Please withdraw the request for the payment as soon as possible. I’m not happy with this unpleasant miscommunication with you.  M: Please search what the trial lesson means. This lesson is of course free since this is an exploring time.   Loop: Hi - there’s no need to be rude  Loop: I’ve voided it. You won’t be charged. Have a nice day.  But M starts blaming me for other charges as well, and I start to get mad.  M: You actually charged me $87.20 instead of $45. So, credit remaining is $38.15 after you cancelled only $45.  Here’s another area where I may have been unnecessarily rude:  Loop: No. Does it make sense for me to have charged you a remaining 38.15? I have a set rate of 45. I voided the one lesson I submitted with you. The other charges are not my problem. Please don’t contact me again.  M: It’s my bad to meet you. I won’t contact you any more.  And then I ❤️ed the message.  AITA in this situation?\n",
      "Wife has a friend (Liz).  We were over her house one night & mentioned that she had a tree that needed to come down in her front yard but was hesitating on hiring a tree crew for removal.  Estimates were expensive, range was from $3500 to $5500.  Liz didnt know I have a \"lumberjack\" hobby.  I have most of the tools of the trade so I asked her to show me the tree.  I felt confident I could drop the tree exactly where she wanted it.  The huge cost was the crane the tree crews bring plus insurance & other overhead.  So I volunteered to do it.  I told her I would fell the tree exactly where she wanted it.  Delimb the trunk & make some piles.  One for brush, one for small logs & finish off by cutting the trunk up into firewood sized pieces.  She was surprised & happy.  I dont mind the hard work & enjoy a day with my chainsaws.  Its great exercise too.  She insisted on paying me. I refused but we did come up with something.  She cuts hair at a local salon, rents a chair/booth so we worked out 2 years of free haircuts.  So the big day came, I cut her tree as described & started with haircuts.  A few haircuts later & my wife asks if I am tipping Liz on my visits.  I respond no, we just keep track of remaining haircuts & schedule the next visit before I leave.  My wife was embarrassed & couldnt believe I was that stingy. She says you always tip the stylist, especially because my wife likes the way Liz cuts my hair.  I asked if Liz tipped me and reminded wife that I did  alot  of hard labor plus consumed much gasoline & bar oil that I supplied.  If you want to compare costs, 2 years of haircuts - so 24 visits at the average rate for men's hair cuts doesnt even come close to the $3500 which was the cheapest estimate she received- thats what I saved her.  I didnt like to keep score like that because I didnt mind doing a service for a friend plus I had fun, but IMO Liz definitely got the better deal now that we're talking about it.  Wife says Im embarassing her in front of her friend.  My view is that we bartered one service for another: free haircuts for free tree cutting/cleanup and no further money needs to exchange hands.  When the free haircuts run out and I begin paying for them, of course I'd tip her.  AITA?\n",
      "My MIL (58) is having some memory loss  problems and they can’t figure out what is causing it. She’s been to a neurologist and they ruled out dementia and Alzheimer’s. She doesn’t work and stays home alone during the day in a small apartment while my FIL works. She doesn’t drive and doesn’t leave the apartment. This past month she has been calling my wife everyday hysterically crying that she’s depressed and has even mentioned not wanting to be alive at times. This has my wife worried. We live an hour away and it’s hard for my wife to visit her as much as she’d want.   My wife is currently 37 weeks pregnant and is having a very difficult pregnancy. She’s currently off work and taking it easy. We live in a 840 sq ft house with our dog and our 8yr old son. We close on our new house in 2 weeks and with all her complications I don’t want her packing anything. I’m planning on packing this week to get things moving.  This is where our problem comes in. My wife wants my MIL to stay with us this upcoming week so she can help pack and also to get her out of the house. I told her I don’t want her staying with us until we move. Our house is so small and she’d have to sleep in the living room and I leave for work early and it’s just not convenient right now. I told her as soon as we move she can stay with us. I don’t care if it’s the first night in the new house, she can stay with us. As far as this week, I rather her not stay. My wife is upset and called me an asshole for not wanting my MIL here. My mom stayed with us this weekend and my wife says it’s not right that my mom cans stay and not my MIL. I explained that my mom stayed the weekend which is different since I’m not working and coming home tired and wanting to relax. My wife said there’s no point in MIL staying the weekend since my FIL is home and they usually go out.  AITA in this situation?\n",
      "AITA for provoking my younger brother?  I (34f) have a brother (33) who lives with my Dad (71), my youngest brother (29), youngest brother’s fiancé (29) and their son (7). I don’t live with them anymore.  The 33 year old brother (call him Matthew) has been getting worse and worse of late, constantly spouting racist, eugenic, slurs and thinking himself smarter than anyone else. He’s always been confrontational and he used to bully my youngest brother; now he’s turning his attentions on my 7 year old nephew in the name of teaching him not to be “weak”.  So today, I bumped into my 29 year old brother, his fiancé and their son and went home with them because my nephew wanted me with him. Matthew was there and almost immediately stole my nephews’ favourite teddy from him and taunted him, because he wanted a hug or something? And then he wouldn’t give it back, holding it above my nephew’s head who was very upset.  So I took Matthew’s hat off his head to balance the scales and gave it to my nephew to “trade”. My nephew let it go too quick and so Matthew kept the teddy and said “what is the lesson here?” My nephew didn’t know and didn’t care; he just wanted his teddy back. So I said as a jokey thing we say, that the lesson is that Uncle Matthew is a pain in my nephew’s side.  But Matthew persisted in asking what the lesson was. At this point, and having seen him do this too many times before, these “lessons” that just make my nephew cry, I said it again. And so my nephew repeated it. So then Matthew said something about “no, Auntie’s lying, that’s not the lesson”. So then my nephew got more upset, thinking he was wrong, looking to me for answers.  So then (this is too long, sorry), Matthew repeated what he always says “you’re making him weak, teaching him to be weak”. Usually, I ignore him but this time, fed up, I said something along the lines of “what you’re trying to teach him may not be the lesson he learns.” And Matthew properly bellowed “SHUT THE FUCK UP, WOMAN.”  I said no. He accused me of being overbearing, making my nephew weak, and that “the literature” all agreed with him. And yes, I said “I’d rather be “overbearing” than a knob head” which wasn’t very grown up of me, I admit.  My youngest brother stepped in at this point and told us to stop because last time we argued, Matthew kicked a hole in the toilet door while I was in there and he (youngest brother) didn’t want it to happen again. And he said to me that I don’t back down, Matthew doesn’t back down, it escalates and that youngest brother has tried arguing back and it never works.  So I might be TA because it’s not my house and I don’t want to make things uncomfortable for the people who live there, especially not my nephew, but I’m also just so sick of Matthew talking down to everyone and airing his horrible views and making my nephew cry again and again, and that we’re all expected to not say anything because it’ll “make him worse”. AITA?\n",
      "My ex husband and I were together for 8 years, and we had 5 cats, one of which passed before we separated, and one of which came with me. Of the 3 that he kept, one is an older girl named Sadie. He had Sadie before we had even begun dating. We've stayed civil since we separated, and we're both in new relationships.  Sadie recently got a new growth on her face-- my ex assumed it was a cyst and brought her to the vet to be seen. They biopsied it, and the results came back cancerous. We were talking on the phone about it because he was very obviously distraught, and he asked what I thought he should do. I had to put my cat down very suddenly this past July, so I was especially empathetic to what he was going through. I told I thought the best thing was to spend as much time with her as he could and put her to sleep before she began to struggle. It's already spread to her lungs, and she's at least 18 years old.  His girlfriend messaged me later in the day and said she thought it was inappropriate for me to tell him to euthanize his cat and that there was no reason Sadie wouldn't fight it and beat it, and that he wouldn't drop the idea of euthanizing since we'd talked. I apologized for overstepping any boundaries, but I maintained my position on what I'd told him. AITA?\n",

Background info-He cries over everything if he does not get anything or if it does not go his way.Today the left but he keeps pissing me off by crying my and my parents house is pretty quiet because I’m their last child in the house out of four siblings. My half brother does not live here. Anyway back to why I don’t want him to come over again he cries for everything and gets what he want when he wants it.he also has to touch everything and he does not give me a minute to breathe or to relax and today and yesterday he was playing with the magnet’s on the fridge and there was a check on it and I think he took it and throw it away because it was there before he was playing with the fridge and then it disappeared and that was my grad money. he also won’t ask me to go in MY ROOM he just walks in when he pleases and my sister told me to not yell at him or discipline him when he does nothing wrong so am I the asshole for not wanting him to come over?  Edit-thanks for giving me some tips and agreements and disarmaments and here’s some answers his parents just gives him whatever he wants and he also knows rights to wrong he’s also almost five he knows how to talk and say what’s going on  I should also put out they(him and his parents)come and vist once in while for those asking why he comes over\n",
      "I (21F) live alone with my father. He has a dog who's getting old and sick. I'm not a dog person at all, I don't like them much, so I don't interact with her. Luckily she is quiet and not too rowdy and up-in-your-face like many other dogs tend to be, so I've been able to live with her without any problems. I did not choose to adopt her, either, so she is not at all my responsibility.  Thing is, she's getting old. She's obviously in pain because she's stiff and limps wherever she goes, and she pees and poops on the floor just right in front of my dad multiple times a day because she can't control it. My dad got diapers but then gave up after one day because it didn't stay on. Didn't even try taping it or anything. He hasn't taken her to the vet or anything, either, despite me literally begging him to. I don't like dogs, but she's a living creature and deserves care. I was considering taking her myself, but I work retail and don't have the money to take a dog to the vet when she has an owner with stable income who should be doing it.   My dad planned to go out of town (without consulting me) and told me he'll need me to take care of the dog. If this had been a couple years ago when she could control her bowels and her bladder, I would have said yes without question.   But I can't stand things like urine and feces, and I don't want to be in charge of cleaning up after a dog who's crapping on the floor multiple times a day for a week. It'll be my birthday week, too, plus I have a job that keeps me busy. If this were a simple \"let her out a few times a day, make sure she has food and water\" kind of deal, I could do it, but he is basically asking me to clean up after her for a whole week, and I don't think I can handle that. She's not my dog, so there's only so much I'm willing to do to help out. And he didn't even ask me first! And he's not paying me.  WIBTA if I tell him he needs to find a sitter for her because I refuse to take care of her?  EDIT: I contribute to expenses. My dad pays rent, but I pay for all our groceries, household items and office supplies. I also do most of the housework.   Also, I'm immunocompromised. Part of my problem with feces is that it's unsafe. This dog is clearly sick and cleaning up her feces could pose a huge risk to my health that I don't want to take.\n",
      "My brother (21) moved to our father’s place a day ago place because he couldn’t find a job at my mom’s place.  And he always breaks one of my two most crucial rules when it was my own room, close the door and don’t let any dogs in. Even my parents close the door and don’t let the pets in. I don’t want my sheets covered with piss and I’m also a light sleeper so when the dogs bark, I’m just wake up instantly. I calmly say to him to not let any dogs in. And he doesn’t listen to me at all.  So AITA?\n",
      "I definitely feel like the asshole but here we go.  I’m number 4 out of 8 kids in a blended family. Because of this, I’ve never had my own party. Number 7 and number 6 have their birthdays within a 5 day period before mine, and since they go first and they’re younger I don’t even get to pick cake flavor. Last year I opened birthday cards at the kitchen table alone and only my parents and one sibling gave me a gift because the household gets tired of birthdays by the time mine roles around.   Number 8 has never had that issue as she is the only child who has a birthday in June. Additionally, she has 7 older siblings, is the only member of my household to be blood related in some manner to every single other member, and our parents had her at age 40 so they get exhausted with her antics very quickly. As consequence, she usually ends up getting whatever she wants from someone or another after a tantrum or two.   I graduate high school two days before her birthday and she’s started demanding that I “share” my grad party with her. In theory I wouldn’t mind and I feel awful saying no to a second grader, but I don’t want her little friends underfoot, I don’t want birthday candles on the cake that I got to pick out, I don’t want everyone to be focused on giving her gifts and forgetting about me again, and I don’t want her monopolizing attention. I know high school isn’t a big deal but I’ve had some significant mental health problems throughout in the past couple years and I’m very proud of how well I’ve done. Am I the asshole for wanting my accomplishments acknowledged, even at the expense of a little kid’s feelings?  EDIT: I forgot to mention that I told her that I didn’t want to let her share and our mother got upset with me because “now everyone has to listen to her cry about it”\n",
      "Introducing my S/O Mike, my friend Cassie and her husband Bob. We were all very close, even \"aunt & uncle\" to their kids.  My S/O and I are great now, but of course we've had rocky times. I try to keep our relationship private, but there have been times that I've reached out to Cassie and Bob for support. They were always supportive and helped us make it through those tough times.  Bob has occasionally been inappropriate with me; pressuring me to sleep naked with him and his wife, asking if he could watch me shower, pressuring me to cuddle with him w/o a bra when I said I did not want to be touched, etc. This has been pretty upsetting for me and I've tried to set boundaries, but I always got over it to keep the peace b/c Cassie would say he didn't mean anything wrong by it and he was trying to help me feel more comfortable around him.  Recently I hung out with them and Mike wasn't with us that day and they said I seemed stressed. My mother was in the hospital, COVID-19's going around, and I just lost my job. They say no they can tell it's not that stressing me out, but if I'm not ready to talk about it then they won't push me.  I say Ok, what do you think it is that's stressing me out then?  They say that Mike doesn't love me and I need to leave him. I'm stunned. Then it's like a dam broke and they start venting, saying he doesn't respect me, is inconsiderate to them etc and I start to ugly cry. I feel blindsided and upset. IDK where all this is coming from. I defend him but they dismiss it saying I'm in denial. I start self-doubting. I listened to everything they said and sobbed through the whole thing.  FTR the reasons they gave were mostly petty and none of them recent. They never talked to me about any of it until now and acted like everything was fine this whole time.  Ex: We’ll go out to dinner and they tell us it’s their treat, but they say he takes advantage by ordering the most expensive thing on the menu (not true). He'd order the same thing if we were paying. We treat them too but I don’t keep track of how much their plates cost, I just want them to have a great time.  Then Bob said I should sleep with him to get back at Mike. I told him no, that Bob's like a brother. Cassie tells me to consider it b/c Bob is great in bed, and she'd be happy to join. I repeat I'm not interested, they're my family and I wouldn't do that with anyone for \"revenge\" b/c that's not healthy.  And then something clicked, so I asked about the the past and they admitted they'd been trying to initiate a threesome. Now they're both pressuring me to consider. I again say no and change the subject, evening ends.  I can't act like this was ok. I want to clarify, I would never end a friendship over someone trying to look out for me. But I’m questioning their ulterior motives, and believe that good friends do NOT try to hit on an emotionally vulnerable friend and try to convince them to sleep with them.  AITA?\n",
      "My boyfriend (26M) and I (25F) recently moved in together. We have a shared office space, which doubles as our guest bedroom when we have visitors (which is pretty frequent)  While we were unpacking and moving in, I noticed a book written by a politician/businessman who is quite well known (and quite devisive). I do not share beliefs that align with this author- and while having this book in our shared space doesn't make me feel deeply unsafe, I know some potential guests that would and am uncomfortable with having our future guests see the autobiography and it's author and believe that I could in any way support that individual.   When I asked my partner if we could hide/give the book away, he was very, very reluctant. His perspective is:    he's read the book- it's not related to anything devisive, it's just an autobiography  He doesn't back the individual politically. And anyone who sees the book is welcome to begin a dialogue with him about it.   It's a book that he bought with his money, and he doesn't want to give it away.    My perspective is this: it makes me uncomfortable having this book present in our shared space. And I feel like my discomfort should take precedent- as this is a rather inconsequential matter and my partner would never have noticed if the book went missing in the first place.   My partner eventually conceded, but I want an outside opinion- am I wrong here?\n",
      "So I (F17) am from the east coast of the USA, and planning to attend college on the west coast. I likely would have had to go to an east coast college for my parent’s comfort, but the school on the west coast was the most prestigious I got into, and ranked highly for my area of interest.   To backtrack, this application season and my junior year due to covid was immensely stressful. I was isolated from friends from virtual school, and my home environment isn’t the most healthy. My dad has anger issues (we don’t really talk much), and since I was about 12 my mom has come to me as emotional support because of my dad. I’ve mentioned seeking therapy, but she always says she doesn’t need it. As a result of my dad, my mom can also get frustrated easily, and can say hurtful things which she doesn’t mean; such as saying I won’t succeed, comparing me to my sister/cousins, and when I applied to the school I am going to, she told me that I would never get in and to not bother applying (Looking back I don’t think she seriously meant this, I think she was just upset about something). However, I would like to say my mom is also so supportive of my accomplishments. But in essence, these past two years, mentally I haven’t been doing the best - I try to put a smile on, because it seems to improve the home environment.   So my mom has been talking about wanting to rent a home near my University, at least for the first month or maybe long term. She said that now she can finally enjoy (my mom was a SAHM) and wants to explore the West Coast, and that she can also be there for me for support and to spend time together. So I know my mom isn’t planning to live on campus, and she said that she wants to explore the WC, but I already feel like a lot of the emotional dumping is going to fall back on me. At some point, I guess my mom saw the look on my face and asked what’s wrong. I told her nothing. She pressed, and I explained that I’m torn about her moving. I said that while obviously I can’t tell you what to do, but I wish everything you did wasn’t based on needing to be near me. My mom then denied all of this, and eventually I raised my voice, and stated examples of going on to school trips (to DC and Florida) and her following me to the same destination in secret, and then telling me when I came back. Once again my mom said clearly we don’t understand each other, because she “just went for her own fun”. I immediately apologized for raising my voice earlier, but my mom has not spoken to me since. One hand, I do feel bad for what I said because my mom truly has been through a lot and a tough married life, but a part of me still feels angry - why is it that you were never there for me emotionally mom, but now you want to come to California to “support me”. I just feel kind of lost.\n",
      "My maternal grandmother died last week. Her funeral is tomorrow. She was pretty well off from her second husband and prepaid for her funeral costs but there are a few things that still need payment. It's 600 to open the mausoleum and 520 for the after funeral luncheon.   My mom doesn't have any money. She works a minimum wage job and is notorious for letting her bills get shut off due to nonpayment. She's never really had to be responsible in her life because my dad or grandma has always bailed her out. My parents divorced when I was pretty young (mom cheated on my dad) and my grandma hated him for no reason. She also did not like me. No joke, she once said that my dad liked me better because I looked like him. And she really used that as a reason not to like me.   I (28F) have one sister (33F). My mom has no siblings so the three of us are the only family she had.   To be honest, she was a mean spirited person. She got enjoyment out of being mean to people. I was basically NC with her, I've her seen her maybe twice over the last 5 years and tried my best to avoid her. Her will and trust left everything to my mom, but her trust states my mom will receive 500 dollar monthly payments until she dies or the trust funds run out. If there are funds after my mom dies they all go to my sister. This was changed in 2016 - it was previously to be split between us.   I know my mom has no money to pay for the food or to open the mausoleum. She just keeps saying how she's not worried about it and how she'll figure it out and how she can \"work something out\" with these people. I know in the end my sister and I will be asked to pay for it.   This probably comes off as bitter but oh well. This woman was awful to me my entire life. She used money as a way to manipulate people. When my sister turned 16 she bought her a car. This was her way of hoping to make my sister like my mom (and grandma) better than my dad. For my 16th birthday I got an empty card. During college I tried to extend an olive branch and go over for Christmas. After showing my sister and I (both very broke) a tray of rings worth thousands, she comes out of her bedroom with 2 rings, leans over me and hands them to my sister and says \"pick which one you like better and give the other to your sister.\" When I became an adult she expected me to want to repair our relationship. As an adult, I don't know how a grown woman could be so awful to a child and I had no interest in being a part of her life.   I know my mom has no way of paying for this and will have no intention of paying my sister and I back. I barely want to go to this funeral, let alone throw away money that I really don't have. So AITA for not wanting to help with funeral costs for a woman who openly hated me and cut me out of her will/trust?\n",
      "I had a plan for a 'surprisf wedding' for my partner, no proposal, no engagement, we happen to stumble across the scene of an already setup wedding, she's shocked and delighted, we walk down the isle and get married with all our friends and family already there and in on the secret. I'm not here to debate if this is a good idea, I've considered it for years and come to the conclusion my partner would be delighted by it.   I worked out all the details, I know exactly the custom dress she'd have made, the details of the venue and setting, ect ect, this took some work.  I talk to her family about it and they're reasonably a bit concerned, I assure them, and begin to involve her sister (who will be the maid of honor), in the planning.  The sister, her husband, and 6yo boy live a couple states over, so they'd have to fly in for the wedding, their spending history and luxury cars, house, and winter condo in a warmer climate indicate that money doesn't seem to be the biggest consideration for them.   I finally pick the date, Feb 8, 2020, excitedly tell the sister and verify the venue is available to be met with this response:   \"Hi (OP), no problem at all. I'm sorry, but we couldn't possibly make that date. (Her son) and I will be in school and we would have just left (your state) the month prior. We can be in (your state) anytime between December 20th and January 5th. Is there no way for these friends to be in the area during that window?\"  Initially I went along with it but eventually I couldn't continue, I was so enraged that she would presume to tell me when I could get married. The date is important for my partner's preferred setting, hopefully with snow on the ground and early Feb is a safe bet.  I haven't told my partner about this because I think it might significantly affect her relationship with her sister. My problem is that I'm stuck on what to do, my partner incessantly and open complains about us not being even engaged yet, and everytime she does it increases my negative feelings toward her sister over it.  Normally I talk to my partner about everything. This is eating me up inside and I'm at the point where I hate her sister for it and like the idea of eventually revealing what happened. I know this is not a good way to feel and planned on never telling my partner but my resentment continues to grow everytime my partner mentions marriage or I think about the fact that I could be married already.  WIBTA if I tell my partner what her sister said in response to me having a scheduled wedding surprise date, effectively cancelling my marriage surprise plans?  EDIT: I've been the asshole for blaming me not being married on my partner's sister. Again, I'm not here to debate whether a surprise wedding is a good idea for my partner. I understand it is a terrible idea for most people, I've spend literally years considering the idea and coming to the idea of doing it. You are not my partner, nor do you know her.  UPDATE: I confessed to my gf the entirety of the situation. She said she would have loved a surprise wedding. I am relieved but devastated as well.  EDIT2: Thank you for the responses, they've granted me some things to think about and that I need to work on putting my ego in check. Yes I am an asshole, yes I come across as an asshole. Thank you to those commenters able to articulate your viewpoints in a constructive manner. Reddit has helped me become closer to my gf and begin working towards a better place in my relationship with her and my in-laws. I'm going to stop responding to comments now, I apologize for being an asshole to the other assholes and non assholes in this thread.\n",
      "I don't know how to feel about this, so I'll try to be as concise as I can.  Today is a  \"Bunnies' Day Out\"  event at my local shelter and what that means is its kinda like  'Hoppy Hour'  events held in CA, OR, OH, etc. Rabbit owners/parents bring their furbabies to socialize and meet other bunnies, and you get to mingle and just bask in the cuteness of bunnies for a few hours. Its also to promote rabbit welfare and how bunnies are not just Easter pets. I've been pretty excited about this for  4 weeks  now, and I can try to improve my social skills as I'm a huge introvert. Also, she needs her nails trimmed and they do it for free so I can't pass that up.  Well coincidentally, my brothers have spontaneously decided to go to the zoo today and I had already planned not to go. I'm not in the mood to walk around in huge crowds in 80 degree heat downtown.  Plus, I'm trying to save money. Well, my brothers don't like that one bit.   I'm in my room right now and I hear my brothers whining about how I won't go to the zoo with them. You know what they do? They open/close their closet doors causing it to vibrate and shake my bedroom door, thus scaring Keira in the process. When rabbits thump, they either sense danger or are upset about something.  SHE THUMPED 16 TIMES AND WAS FLAT-OUT ANGRY . It took me a while to calm her down but I'm still upset. Really, I feel muddled about this whole situation. I don't know what to feel right now.

      "My sister’s(18f) boyfriend(18m) was in our house a few times last week. I (24m) come home from work tired and all I want is to relax and it started to bother me that this guy is in our house.   The worst part is he sometimes stays for dinner and I don’t feel comfortable with him eating with the family. I can’t stand him talking teeneger nonsense to impress my mom and it is really tiring. First I told my sister politely that I don’t want this guy to be in our house and reminded she didn’t ask me befor inviting a guest. She didn’t care and said mom is ok and my gf comes too. I told her it is not the same. My gf doesn’t bother her and my sister doesn’t work like I do. I told her if he comes another time I will make sure that he knows he is not wanted here.  She got really upset told me she will invite him and doesn’t talk to me. When i ask her something she ignores making me even more angry at her and her bf. And my mom doesn’t even care I work and I am tired. The thing is she doesn’t even work and I think she has no right to act this way.   AITA?\n",
      "I live with a couple in a 2 bedroom house and all 3 of us are on a year lease and its been about 6 months so far. My main issue is with the girlfriend of the couple. Let's start off with the few good things about her:  1: She's pretty quiet at night time hours, doesn't steal food, etc etc (basically respects boundaries)  That's pretty much it.  More background about the living situation: she is 27 years old, unemployed (her bf just pays for everything), and sits in her room for 22 hours a day. The boyfriend works 55 hours a week, I work 40 hours a week. Now personally, I don't care if she's unemployed and does nothing about it, I don't care what she does in her free time, but there are so many mutual chores she does NOTHING about.  &#x200B;  For example: Their dishes in the sink? Sits there for about 4-5 days straight. Their trash bag with trash sitting by the door way? Sits there for almost a week. Guess who vacuums the living room and wipes off the kitchen counters and cleans the microwave and fridge? Not her. She's also the one who does laundry between the two of them and their unfinished laundry will sit in there washing machine/dryer for almost an entire week (Which I don't understand because... she's home all day). I'll also find like crumbs and actual food stains on the kitchen counter which will just sit there until I do something about it.  &#x200B;  I've tried being extremely patient and understanding with her. I've even told her \"hey listen, can you spend 10 mins per day checking out the common shared areas and cleaning up whatever needs to be cleaned, then you can do whatever you want the rest of the day?\" and she would reply \"yeah sure\".... and then it would happen for a couple days then stop. I've had that exact convo with her many many many times over the past 6 months and no dice. Even talked to her bf to get her to do stuff.  &#x200B;  Yes I do ask her boyfriend to help contribute to certain chores, but I rarely do it simply because he's bringing home the money, and also he's barely home.\n",
      "I (26m) am married to my amazing wife Leah (25f) and we are expecting our first baby in November. I'm a foster kid. I aged out of the system after a pretty shitty experience with the system. I have trauma. Lots of trauma. It's not something I can talk about easily. Leah and my therapist are the only people I have opened up to and I try not to burden my wife with this. She understands and never pushes. But she has told me I can tell her anything when I need to.  Her sister Janet (33f) and BIL Michael (37m) are foster parents and biological parents. Their first foster kid has been with them for about four months now and the kid is struggling. The kid hasn't told them much about their experience but they assume, probably correctly, that their time in foster care has not been very positive.  Janet wanted me to take her foster kid under my wing and speak to them about being a foster kid and basically act like a therapist. She said based on my own history in the system, I would be the best person to help. But I don't feel up for that. I don't think I can deal with someone else's trauma related to foster care on top of my own and I don't feel like I could talk about my experiences either or bring up my trauma to the child.  Janet and Michael did not like my response. Leah and Janet fought. Then Janet and I disagreed very strongly on it. She told me I was an asshole and as a grown ass man and soon to be father, I should be willing to help a child and how can I expect to be a good father when I have so much trauma that I cannot put it aside for a child in need.  I feel bad about the kid. I feel some guilt. But AITA?\n",
      "This is a repost because I didn’t respond to the mod in time (was watching Christmas movies!)  This happened a little while ago but my older Sister-in-law (SIL) is still throwing shade over it.  A few years ago I married my lovely husband (SIL’s brother). We had an amazing day and I wore the usual white dress. However I didn’t want a white bag that I’d never use again, so my bag/purse was made from the same gorgeous blue silk as my bridesmaids’ dresses. It also meant my chief bridesmaid could hold it for me during the ceremony and photos, looked really cute and held all the little bits and pieces I wanted with me on the day (a girl needs to keep her makeup looking fresh).  However, despite it not being white I rarely have the opportunity to use it but couldn’t bring myself to get rid of it. So when husband’s youngest sister announced she was getting married I thought it would be the perfect time to use my lovely little blue bag as my outfit was pretty neutral (NOT white or cream - I know the rules) and a bit of colour would help lift it a little. The bride was wearing white and none of her colours were blue so I thought it would be ok.   We were sat at the same table as my other SIL when she noticed my bag and mentioned it was the one I had on my wedding day. I was kind of surprised that she remembered it as I’d forgotten that I was holding it in a small number of our wedding photos (not the main set, just some snaps my MIL took) but did confirm she was right and said I rarely got to use it these days and it was too cute not to take the opportunity. She was not impressed and said it was tacky to make her sister’s day about me and my wedding. I tried to tell her that I honestly wasn’t doing that but she wouldn’t listen. To be honest I’ve long suspected she has never liked me much but she’s never been that openly hostile towards me. Anyways, it seems to have given her good reason to really dislike me and things have been very frosty ever since.   So Redditors, Am I the Asshole for using my wedding handbag at someone else’s wedding? Of course I don’t think I am, but my older sister-in-law clearly thinks I deliberately disrespected her sister, and just because I think I’m innocent doesn’t mean I’m not an a-hole.  UPDATE: I just wanted to thank you all for your feedback, even the questions asking if I knew why my SIL doesn’t like me. The sad truth is a don’t know why and I may never know. I do know deep in my heart that I tried to have a good relationship with her and the rest of my in laws. But it seems that whatever I do it’s never going to be good enough and I need to stop wasting my energy. It is sad. So thank you for helping my find peace with this. I genuinely was doubting myself, so while this may have seemed like I was seeking validation, I honestly needed to check I hadn’t accidentally broken some unwritten rule.  Happy New Year to you all. I hope 2023 is a kinder year for you all.\n",
      "So basically my story goes like this.  I have an older sister and we are a family of four with just me,my mom, my dad and her.  My sister is constantly rude to everyone she meets and is jealous of me because she says I'm \"smarter than her and get better things than her\" I'm a humble person so when people tell me I'm smart I never say \"Yes of course I am\" or \"I already know\"  We have a top ten at my school and ever since I started grade 4 I have always been number 1 in my grade but my sister would always be like number 7 or 10. My parents praise me a lot for that and often use this as a way to mock my sister whenever she is out of line or rude but I always try my best to make her feel better when they do and what do I get in return? Comments like \"Just shut up you know you're the favourite and our parent love you more than me so don't even try giving me your fake pity\"  This often ends in me saying really hurtful things to her and she ends up crying to my father who tells me \"She is your older sister. Whether you like it or not you have to show her respect\" he then makes me apologize and it leaves me really mad. We have a four year age difference and my sister is always acting like the younger one when I confront her about that she just says\"Acting like a child gets her what she wants\".  My sister is often violent with me and gets into physical fights with me when we argue and when I defend myself and end up hurting her she gets me in trouble and makes me feel really bad about hurting her.  One day we had a fight so big that she ended up calling me useless, ungrateful and all types of hurtful things so from then on I refused to speak to her.   She took me  not wanting to talk to her as a joke so when I still refused to talk to her for a good 2 weeks she told my parents and they ended up getting into a huge fight where they told her she was stupid and they didn't want her as their daughter anymore.   She then came back to me begging me to talk to her saying that I'm all she has left and I really feel bad for leaving her with no one.   AITA for not wanting to talk to my sister after everything she did?\n",
      "Basically what it says. My kids are 7 and 8 and have seen me hit my vape pen a handful of times after dinner or before bed. We live in a state where it’s been legal a few years (Washington) I’ve been working for myself for years, and a lot of extended family smokes- so I’m not worried about anyone finding out.  The first time my kids saw me was an accident and I felt horrible- but my husband (who doesn’t smoke himself) told me it was no different than our kids seeing him order a beer at a restaurant and that helped me see it for what it really is. I wouldn’t be happy if my kids used weed or drank alcohol before 21, but after 21 I have no problem with my kids (theoretically) smoking weed and drinking in moderation. Honestly I’m more worried about cigarettes and they see people smoking outside restaurants all the time, but that’s not their parent so it holds a different weight in my opinion. So am I being the asshole here by letting them see it occasionally and talking openly about it?\n",
      "Lil backstory, I (f23) became friends with (f24) online about an year ago and we met about twice in 6 months and we used to talk often on text. We were both going through breakups however she moved on quicker since hers wasn't that serious.  Moving further, i was busy prepping for exams and finally got vacation in May end and we both were planning to go somewhere but she kept delaying like June end, July mid or August and i could've waited except my results were due in July end and either I pass or fail (it's about 12% passing rate for this professional exam) would mean I'd either start my work or I'd have to start studying again, neither of which i could do if i went so late so i kinda just gave up on plan to go.  Then around June's 3rd week i saw this post about this awesome train to goa with waterfalls along the way and vista dome with revolving recliners to enjoy and i just looked it up and 1 seat was available kinda pricey and i booked in the spur of the moment without thinking of abode or anything and planned everything haphazardly and left within couple of days.  In the middle of the vacation she texted and i forgot to tell her and i couldn't tell her then so i didn't and i forgot about the entire trip because i came back and my results came sooner than i expected and i passed and had to finalize the firms etc.   So it's been 5 months since then and i talked to her today randomly and she said you didn't tell me you went and i remembered i forgot to talk about it with her and so ig i might be an AH for dropping the ball time and again.  PS- the reason i didn't tell her while i was on vacation was that she has a history of taking drastic decisions like i cancelled my weekend plans with her because i failed an exam and results came that day and she deleted my number and didn't talk for months.\n",
      "So as many of you know it’s finals time so I was taking my history final and noticed my classmate Blake was cheating off my paper. Blake doesn’t ever pay attention and doesn’t take school seriously and I study for my finals and get good grades. So here’s what I did I warned him once and then I started circling the wrong answer and putting an x over the right answer. Blake failed the final and when I informed him of what I did he called me an asshole so reddit AITA?\n",
      "I (21f) had my first baby recently. My boyfriend and I did very generic over skype introductions with everyone who wasn't close to us. For me, the close relatives were my grandparents and for my husband it was his sister and parents. My dad had the skype introduction. He and I have never been too close and my grandparents took care of me after my mom died. He started making a bit more of an effort when I was 17 but it's not a relationship I see being super close ever. He got married two years ago. His wife has younger kids 12f, 10m, 8m and 7f. It seems dad hyped them up the whole pregnancy that they would be aunts and uncles and they would get this really special aunt and uncle introduction to the baby where they could hold them and spend time with them. I did not know this. We never talked about this. I am not at all close with anyone in his household, including him, so why he promised them this is beyond me. But after I skyped with him and got that out of the way he called me up and said the kids were so upset not to get the promised introduction, which I didn't know about until he called to yell at me for it. I told him hang on, we had no deal like that, and I never said any of them would have a super special introduction or relationship with my son.  My dad said it was a dick thing, that they're kids and want their big sister to include them and for their nephew to be part of their lives. I told him I'm nobody's sister and that if he wanted to get technical, he's more my brother than my dad since my grandparents did his job for him. I also told him he should be grateful we spoke at all. He told me it's not about him but the kids and they were so upset over it.  I'm honestly reconsidering if I want even minimal contact with him now. But I do want to know if I was a jerk to the kids by not including them more or thinking of them more, with them being innocent and everything.  AITA?\n",
      "My husband (30M) and I (31M) adopted a black cat named Susie a few weeks before the world shut down in March. She's was both my husband and I's first ever pet and we loved her a lot. In April, we had to take an emergency trip out of the country  to visit my husband's family and we left Susie with my parents and their cat, Jack. We were only supposed to stay for a month max, but we ended up not being able to get home until mid-August. When we got back, Susie had completely forgotten about us and had become bonded to my parents and especially Jack. We ended up letting my parents keep Susie because it felt kind of mean to take her away from a home she's been living in for 5 months.   At the beginning of September my Husband and I were missing having a pet so we went back to the shelter to adopt another cat. The Lady (S) was able to pull up a file and asked about Susie. We told her the situation hoping she'd understand. She actually started yelling at us for 'abandoning' Susie and told us how Susie probably felt depressed because we left her with strangers. She told us that we should have either taken Susie with us out of the country or taken her back home after we got home. She also said that we can't get a new cat just because we got bored of the old one. She told us that she was going to put us on the No Adopt list in the state as well as charge us for animal abandonment. I ended up telling her that if she really wanted her cats adopted she'd be less insane and left. Thinking about it, I do feel kinda bad about just leaving Susie in a new environment just when she was starting to get used to our home. Did we break some sort of weird cat law we dont know about or something. Susie honestly seems bonded with my parents but maybe she'd be better off with us? AITA?\n",
      "Backstory, my landlord is old school and picks up rent in person. If the beginning of the month falls on a weekend, I'll arrange to hand him the rent in advance in case I want to go somewhere, hangout with friends, etc. Basically so I'm not tied down at home waiting for landlord to pick up rent.  Last month, a roommate said he was away on the weekend and asked if I could hand off his rent payment to the landlord. Without thinking about it, I agreed to do the favor, except now I was right back to waiting around at home for landlord to show up, even though I had taken care of my payment the week before. Adding insult to injury, another roommate must've heard and dumped his rent payment on me too.  I thought that was the end of it, just do it one month, and say no, or I won't be home, etc. in the future. Well this month, exactly the same thing, I paid in advance of the weekend, now just today I'm at work, roommate texts me saying he put his rent payment under my door, that I should give it to landlord because he won't be home tonight.  I don't mind doing favors, but I'm not really comfortable handling someone else's rent money. And it feels like people walking over me.  I had no intention of doing anything other than chilling at home tonight, but I texted back saying I might not be home tonight, and now I fully intend to do anything but go home until late.  Thoughts?\n",
      "My wonderful and amazing girlfriend got me a piano for Christmas. She spent around $250-300 on purchasing and transportation of this. I had taken up playing the piano very sporadically and she thought that this would be an amazing gift for me, however there are a few things to know first:   I have no formal practice on a piano  I am embarrassed to play it around people I don’t know who might hear it  We both live in separate apartments  She had planned to get an electric piano that I could plug in to my computer, however this didn’t happen as it was “too expensive” (I would’ve been happy with something even half the price of what she paid for this piano)   We live separately currently and plan to move in soon, but all current and future planned living situations are apartments. Before purchasing this piano, she asked me a very vague question (would I ever want a piano in my house) and I didn’t think anything of it. I only learned about it because I had to help move it.   I’ve lost sleep worrying about this piano. She’s told me I need to start playing it because she spent a lot of money on it (mostly joking of course, but we’re both students so it was expensive for us). I am embarrassed at the thought of moving it again because of how people perceive it at a “party school”. I’ve cried because I don’t want to tell her I don’t like it, but I’m worried that faking it will only make things worse.   WIBTA if I told her I didn’t like the gift and wanted to get rid of it?  EDIT: If I had known she was doing this I would have stopped her beforehand, unfortunately I didn’t know until after the purchase.\n",
      "I commissioned an artist to do a valentines picture for my boyfriend. Come around to valentines day and its not finished. She told me she had gotten an eye infection and was trying to deal with that and do my art. I'm like its ok, feel better, and that my boyfriend liked what she showed us.   Well now its getting to be almost 2 months since it was due to be finished, and the WIP's I've seen doesn't show much progress and the quality doesn't seem to be the same as I had paid for. I feel like an asshole asking for my money back, only 90 bucks but still, I feel like this is getting drawn out and I'm getting aggravated with it. So WIBTA if I asked for my money back on a art piece that was suppose to finished almost 2 months ago?\n",
      "Long story short, sometimes I have slept in our front room on the floor when we are having disagreements. My husband really hates it bc he thinks Im trying to make him feel guilty or throw a pity party but thats not true...I sleep really well up there its darker and I have more room. (We only have a Full size bed and cant afford anything else right now) Recently things have been good for us relationship wise but every night I have been woken up squished to the edge of the bed with no room to move around. I turn over alot in my sleep and I told my husband (of almost 8 years) that hes been doing that and he told me that I shouldnt run away then. Hes trying to cuddle but I cant sleep like that. I tell him I love him all the time. I do thoughtful things. I tried to explain that to him but he told me that i just \"have a warmth problem\" meaning im \"cold-hearted\" bc I cant sleep while being smother cuddled. That made me mad. I understand he feels bad but I cant change the fact I cant sleep like that. We went to sleep that night and he didnt wake me up trying to cuddle. The next night we go to bed no problems but sure enough middle of the night Im scooched to the edge and hes in the middle of the bed. I tried to turn over and accidentally hit my knee on his leg (couldnt put it in the position i needed) and IN HIS SLEEP (i can tell with breathing rate) he muttered to me \"dont bump me on my side of the bed\" i got so upset that his default sleep mode is still \"asshole\" and fed up with almost a week of interrupted sleep, I got up and made a blanket nest on the floor in the front room and enjoyed some deep sleep until woken up by him barging in at 7:30 AM demanding to know why I was up there but when I started to reply about just needing space to sleep properly and wanting to sleep in(sunday morn) he walked away and ignored me which resulted in me freaking out about him being selfish and yelling at him being an asshole. He didnt even remember what he said at night..but doesnt matter bc it makes it worse thats his subconcious \"go-to\". I ended up waking up one of our kids (ones his, ones mine) and felt bad but was TOTALLY triggered by being continuosly messed with. He told me its all me...my manifestation...that my anger is nobody elses fault but my own...which made me even more pissed. I didnt wake myself up!!!! Ive been avoiding him all day until 4pm he sent a text that said \"i love you\" and i replied \"ok i love you too\" he texted back... \"What? That was yesterday\" apparently the text was sent yesterday when my phone wasnt working properly but didnt arrive till today. Weird timing. I said that it was probably his FBI buddy trying to help him out. Hes said \"im fine\". Now I want to sleep in the front bc Im super mad. Kinda hating him right now.  Am I the ASSHOLE???!?\n",
      "So I order two identical items off eBay. The price is $50 and shipping is $50. I add two to my cart and checkout. The total price is $150.   Three weeks later I receive one of the items. I notify the seller of the missing item and I get no reply. The next day I send a follow up message. I propose a chargeback with my card issuer. Almost immediately I get a message from eBay notifying me I have been refunded $50 from this seller.  As with all online shipping there is the item price and the cost for shipping. As buyers we all know the actual “price” of the item is the price plus shipping. Therefore my per item cost (purchased 2 identical items) is $75. I explain the refund of $50 is insufficient. I inform him he has 3 days then I go to eBay.  Now I get storm of emails calling me unreasonable etc. the seller explains I didn’t pay for shipping for the second item so the seller is not shipping it unless I pay $50 for shipping. The other option is I can pay to return the item shipped to me and the seller will refund the balance.  This is where I accuse the seller of being a scammer. The seller accidentally charged $50 per order instead of $50 per item for shipping. Therefore the seller should have contacted me prior to shipping to rectify the mistake. The seller could have cancelled the order but the seller didn’t want to lose the sale. Instead the seller forced the sale by purposefully shorting me.  By shipping the item to me he forced me to pay $100 per item as opposed to $75 per item I agreed to.  AITAH for insisting the seller pay to return the $25 shipping or pay shipping and provide a full refund?   ——-/notes from selller——/  You aid 49.99 for first unit 49.99 for the second unit. You paid 49.99 for shopping first unit.  You never paid to ship the second unit.  Each unit ships on its own . Its a heavy box and costs a lot to ship.  We refunded 49.99 for the second unit.  You can repay shipping and the price for tbe second unit we will ship it   ———-\n",
      "TW for loss and death. My fiance was engaged for about a month to his high school sweetheart when she passed away in a tragic, freak accident. For personal reasons, I don't want to get into how it happened, but it was no one's fault. This was maybe 6 years ago. Just for the purpose of the post I'll call her Mandy.  My fiance has been very open about this loss and how it has affected him throughout our relationship. I know he misses her and the memories he has with her and important and special. I don't want to take away anything or demean the relationship, and I've always been there for him on hard days and supported him when he needed it. We got engaged last year, the date is TBD still for obvious reasons. It was very emotional for both of us, and we've been really happy. But since planning the wedding, I've been feeling like I'm not only planning it for myself, but for Mandy as well.  It started as comments from his family. A lot of \"Oh Mandy would have loved this\" type things. I brushed it off at first and just thought it was a way of them processing grief. I have a great relationship with his family, but I know they loved Mandy too. When I went dress shopping, his mom and sister came. They kept talking about what dress Mandy would have worn, what they could see her in, etc. It might seem like nothing, but it really overtook the conversation, so much so that another bridesmaid told me later that she felt uncomfortable for me too. It turned from harmless comments into focusing what should be a special event for me into reminiscing over Mandy.  My latest project has been compiling old photos of me and my fiance for a slideshow at the reception (or rehearsal dinner we haven't decided). He told me theres something he's been wanting to ask me: he really wants to include some kind of \"in memory of Mandy\" into our wedding, and thinks the slideshow would be a perfect place. At this point, I was (and still kinda am) fed up with the Mandy comments taking over our wedding. I sternly told him that no I don't think that would be appropriate, as this is our wedding and should focus on us. We are having a table with pictures of loved ones who passed, and she will be featured there. He told me that he doesn't think that's enough to honor her memory. He wants to incorporate her in a bigger way, as she never got her dream wedding. He also thinks it would be a sweet surprise for Mandy's parents (who are invited since he is still really close to them).  I did lose my cool, I will admit. I told him honestly how I felt about the Mandy situation taking over our wedding, and how I'm uncomfortable with it. I also asked him if he could ask his family to limit the Mandy comments at our wedding, since now I'm afraid the whole wedding will be focused on her. I told him that I need time away to think and have been staying at my parent's house, but we've still been talking.  AITA? Am I overreacting?  Update: Thank you to everyone for the kind words, I've had a lot to digest over the past few days. I did try to post a separate update, but was told to just add it under my original. I'll try to put a condensed version under here.  The wedding is postponed indefinitely, but we are still together and working through things. He was defensive about the situation at first, but eventually came around. We both agreed that couples therapy is needed, and are in the process of starting that.   As for his family, they are deeply sorry, especially (mostly) his mom. When I went to talk to her about it, she was really in tears. Mandy was like a daughter to her, so she said, and she just hasn't gotten over losing her yet. I talked to her about therapy (she told me she didn't go after Mandy died), and she agrees its something to look into, though not sure if anything concrete has come of it. I can't say that I feel 100% better about the situation, and I think that my relationship with his mom now has a bit of a strain on it, even if she did apologize. But I'm hoping to work through these things in therapy, and if I can't, or my fiance can't, then I'll have to do whats best for me and end the relationship.   If anything else were to happen, I'll try to post an update. Again, thank you to everyone for the support, it means a lot.\n",
      "Some context before I begin. I'm a doctor. I don't examine, diagnose or treat my friends and family, but I will occasionally answer medical questions that people have for me. It's usually people asking me if they should go to the ED or if it can wait to go to a GP, or asking for some clarification on something they don't understand about their health.  My friend has been dating his fiancee for 2 years, and they have been engaged for 3 months. I met her through my friend, and we are friendly but I am not that close with her. Outside of what I know of them as a couple, and the basics of work etc, I don't know that much about her.  So yesterday morning my best friend's fiancee sent me a text asking if I could answer a question she had. She was looking at some blood test results that she could see on her GP's website (it's set up so that patients can view their results etc). She hadn't spoken with the doctor about it, but she wanted to have some idea of what it meant. She then sent me a screenshot of the blood results. I had not replied to her yet by this point. The blood results were of hepatitis serology.  The blood results indicated that she had acute hepatitis B, which means she was infected with it within the last 6 months. For those who don't know, hepatitis B is typically spread via IV drug use or sexual contact in adults. There are more innocent means of contracting the virus, but those are the most common ways for new adult infections. I don't know why she was tested, or how sick she was, or any possible way she may have contracted the virus, so I really had no advice to give her.  I sent her a reply saying that she should call her doctor to discuss the results, and that I lacked the clinical background information that would allow me to interpret the results. She then asked me not to talk to my best friend about it.  I was a little freaked out and didn't know what to do. I spoke with some colleagues and they all agreed that I was under no legal obligation to maintain her privacy, I was not her doctor and she had freely shared the information with me without any response from me, but it is ethically a bit messier. She obviously felt that because she was talking to a doctor, she was covered by doctor patient confidentiality. None of them knew what they would do in the situation. So I was left trying to figure out if I should tell me best friend or not.  This afternoon, I get a phone call from my best friend and he is PISSED. Another mutual friend had told him what was going on, and when he confronted his fiancee she told him that she had talked to me about it. He told me he thought I would have his back in this, and that he's disappointed that I didn't come to him. His fiancee still hasn't admitted to any possible way she might have caught it.  I still don't know whether I would have told him or not, I was feeling shit about it all day. So reddit, AITA?  Edited to fix a mistake.\n",
      "I want to be clear that this is not about money. I know no one owes us money, but he promised and it is about his reasoning.  My fiancee and I are currently planning a wedding and my mom got herself uninvited as we found out she had made some jokes behind our back about my fiancee's appearance/style and saying she was never going to be anything more than a stay at home mom. I was furious and uninvited her. A couple of people told me I was being an asshole as it was a one time thing she said not thinking it would get back to us. Also she was tipsy, maybe a bit drunk.  My dad recently found out she wasn't going to be there (they aren't married) and confronted me. He said what she said wasn't nice but realistically people shit talk and gossip, and I should give her the chance to apologize and move on. I explained that I can't let someone who feels that way come to our wedding, and he said I was being ridiculous. He said he was no longer going to pay for our wedding if I was going to treat my mom like that.  I decided to uninvite him as I feel he is no longer a supportive person. My fiancee was privy to this conversation and is obviously hurt. She doesn't want him there either so I feel the need to support her, but now my dad and his wife are telling everyone how we feel entitled to their money and how arrogant we are for uninviting everyone who \"disagrees\" with us. I feel slightly weird about it because obviously he doesn't have to pay for our wedding.\n",
      "I (32F) am extremely fortunate to have been able to afford a house at 26, with help from my mom (66F) with a deposit. The house is solely in my name. I am an only child and since I’ve been born it’s me, my mom and gran (90F) living together. In 2021 my partner (31M) has moved in and has helped a ton in the house, he has fixed what needs to be fixed.   About 2 years now my uncle (64M) has been working for a company who is not paying him a salary. The entire family is aware of the situation but we were all told it’s fine, the backpay will be paid by “next week” and supposedly it’s millions and millions, like I said this has been going on for just under 2 years now. Their house went on auction 3 times this year but luckily it’s not been sold. The 4th time they weren’t as lucky, their house was sold on auction due to them not paying the bond. My mom found out just as they were being evacuated and offered they can come stay with us until they get their millions. I found this out while I was at work. The next day they were in with ALL their belongings, 2 dogs and 2 cats. My mom offered them her room and my gran was moved to one of my aunts. My aunt works in an office, my uncle works from home and my mom is retired.   They have been in my house for over 3 weeks now. I have never seen someone consume so much coffee and food and doesn’t clean after themselves, me and my partner have to clean the kitchen in the morning before we leave for work, come back after work, cook and still clean up after everyone has eaten. We will be in our room, where we are confined to now, and everyone will walk in to come see what the “kids” are up to. I am extremely frustrated, I am not allowed to say anything or else my mom and aunt are in tears. My uncle is breaking and changing stuff in my house without asking my permission to change it and if I get upset I get told I am being ungrateful. We were told everyday since they moved in that the money will be in the next day, so far nothing has changed. I have 7 rescue dogs of my own, all toy breeds and we make special food for them which includes veggies and brown rice. They have started to give their dogs our dogs food as well now. Nothing is asked, everything is just taken. There’s been no contributions towards the house and I am being made out to be the biggest b*tch in the family now but no one wants to step in and help. My mom is my responsibility and I accept that, I feel looking after people in the family is my plight in life. My cousin also moved in for a year in 2019. My gran had 7 kids and no one wants to help her, so she became my problem as well.   AITA for reacting the way I am currently and just wanting my own space back?  UPDATE:   I had a discussion with my uncle yesterday for changing stuff in my house and there were tears and I was told they’ll move out today and they will all go live under a tree. I am noticing the manipulation that’s happening, I gave them until end of January to get everything in order and to be out by then. I am leaning towards selling the house, thank you to everyone’s input.\n",
      "My brother who is younger than me is generally way better looking than me but that’s ok. He’s a chill dude and my best friend. One of my biggest problems with him however is how whenever we go out he treats me like his own personal photographer. Like he will just stop anywhere and ask for a picture and will pose in a certain way. He’s super preferential and makes me do things like squat down in public just to get a photo of him. I’m sure it makes me look weird but I guess he just doesn’t care. He will make me do at least 3 pictures per location and it does irritate me a lot. I don’t ask him to take many photos of me. I don’t think I look the best in photos so I don’t have him take very many. Maybe like 1 or 3 at most. He also gets annoyed when they don’t come out the way he wants and says stuff to me. I’ve gotten more annoyed at his arrogant behavior whenever he makes me take pictures. I think it was one day in SF I went with my family and like he was making me stop at random locations and my family would get pissed. At one point I was fed up and I just said no and that he was being a selfish prick who only cares about himself. I also said ask your friends, just cause I’m your brother doesn’t mean you treat me like that. If you want someone to take a photo for you ask your friends or hire someone. But if you want from me you have to stop being such an arrogant bitch. I’m not your personal photographer so stop treating me like that. My parents heard everything and my mom scolded my bro for his behavior. Meanwhile my dad reprimanded me for cursing. Keep in mind I wasn’t yelling, but the anger and irritation was clear in my voice. My brother got mad at me and later on I said sorry.  AITA for telling my brother to stop treating me like his own personal photographer?  Also he for the past 2 days kept begging me to come with him to this area near my house. He went there 2 days ago with his friends but complained their photos weren’t good tho I looked at them and they were fine. I knew he would treat me like his personal photographer and act the same way so I kept saying no. He was persistent and I eventually said yes. Luckily I got really busy with school so I wasn’t allowed to go.\n",
      "My roommate and I have sports betting accounts with the same bookie. One week, I lost $200, and my roommate won $200. The bookie eventually closed the book because he was in a ton of debt, and decided not to pay anybody what they were owed.   I was extremely lucky and got away with a $200 loss, but my roommate got scummed out of his winnings. He thinks that I  indirectly owe him $200 and that it would be the honorable thing to do to pay him.   I'm saying absolutely not, and that it's unreasonable to ask that of me. If we were to flip the situation, there's no way that he would pay me out either, nor would I even consider that as a possibility. I got lucky, he got unlucky. Sucks to suck if you ask me.   AITA for not paying?\n",
      "Every year, since I can remember, I have been spending Christmas at my grandma's house where we exchanged gifts. Gifts are made mainly from 3 groups (so each person gets 2-3 gifts). One group is my grandma and my two uncles, with one uncle making the purchases as he has been looking after my grandma and the other uncle who is mentally ill since my grandpa past away around 20 years ago. One group is me and my parents and the final group is my aunt, her husband and two children (one is 26 (m) same age as me (f) and the other is 19 (m)). My uncle had a period where he had a good job and got amazing gifts for everyone, and my parents had a period when they lived abroad and also did quite well, so got good presents. However, times have been hard for everyone due to the economy, health issues etc. I now buy gifts on behalf of me and my parents (they don't have a job now). I recently changed job and city so I'm finding it hard to afford gifts, this year, so I've been buying a lot of small £1-3 gifts for everyone. However, we are 11 on my mom's side alone, I also have my dad's side and very close family friends that have been helping us through these tough times. So even if I'm only spending a little, with around 30 people in total it's getting to £200-300 which is most of my savings right now. Today my aunt in the family group chat said this year they don't have money (although they have more than everyone else) and they don't feel like doing small £5 gifts because it's depressing and pointless less. My younger cousin then chimed in saying every year the gifts \"end up in a corner of the garage or in the trash\" and that we should stop buying each other crappy gifts. Now, this is where the AITA comes in. I don't want to by this group gifts this year for Christmas. They made me feel like shit for the gifts I got them in the past and even shittier about what I was gonna get them this year. However, I feel guilty for not getting them anything. I feel like it is an asshole move and that even if I get them a £1 box of chocolates each I would at least not stoop to their level and ruin Christmas. I feel like I would ruin it by not getting them gifts. We sit together and open all the gifts together at Christmas. I feel terrible at the idea of them being the only ones not opening gifts while everyone else in the family has gotten something from me. WIBTA if I didn't get this group gifts?\n",
      "I allowed one of my closet friends to borrow my car whilst I was at work yesterday. The only condition was that he was to return my car at 5 pm when I finished work so that I could go home.  After waiting out the front of my work in the cold, my friend proceeded to turn up at my work at 5:35 pm and ask if I can jump in the car and go to the hardware shop with his friend that's in the back seat (who I don't know). I said \"sure\" and jumped into the car.  On the drive to the hardware store, they both were talking about what kind of guitar they want and all the extras they want. His friend in the back seat told me that they bought a new wah for his guitar.  My friend:  \"oh she won't know what a wah is\"   Me:  \"Oh I know what a wah is. It's the whammy bar\"   (Yes I was wrong, I thought the whammy bar and the wah was the same thing but different names)  They both proceeds to look at each other and then laugh as loud as they can. They proceed to say things like  \"I cant believe she just said that\"  and  \"That was like movie humour right there\".  All whilst hysterically laughing.  I was left feeling embarrassed and made fun of. After we dropped his friend off at his house, I told my friend that I didn't appreciate having to wait at my work until 5:35 pm when I asked him to have my car ready for me to drive home after work and I also didn't appreciated being made fun of by him and his friend. I told him it made me feel embarrassed and disrespected.  He proceeded to tell me that I embarrassed myself and it isn't his fault that I said something stupid. He told me that if I didn't know about a subject, I shouldn't comment on it.  I made a mistake. I thought it was the same part of the guitar because I have used guitars before. I didn't think this mistake warranted an outburst like that.  So Reddit;  AITA?\n",
      "Before you start reading, this is not going to be one of those crazy stories where the roommate is collecting poop in jars or something weird. Sorry to disappoint lol  My roommate is a man. I am a woman and gay and don’t have much experience living with a man to be honest which is why I’m asking you all if this is normal or not on his end or if I really am being an asshole. But he’s a mostly good roommate, I have zero complaints except his bathroom habits.   He pisses everywhere in the bathroom that we have to share (unless I want to walk a long ways) and it’s driving me nuts. He doesn’t clean it up either. I walk into the bathroom and step in his pee at least once a week. He always says when I bring it up that sometimes he gets up in the middle of the night to pee and that it’s normal for guys to pee on the floor or seat even in the day and I can’t possibly get mad at him for doing it in the night. I told him I thought this was ridiculous and he said because I’m a woman I wouldn’t have any idea.   Now he seems furious at me for even bringing it up and the problem is still not fixed. I’m sorry, but I think it’s disgusting. He counters when I say this that saying that my losing hair is disgusting (like just hair out of my head around the place, I can’t always catch it but if I see a hair I throw it away) but he never complains about the hair so neither should I about the urine. I said hair is different than urine and he disagrees. He’s mad at me, said I shamed him for having a penis basically and I’m wondering if I honestly did something wrong.\n",
      "It may sound harsh if you don't have context. I (39M) have custody of my daughter \"Rose\" (9F) for only a portion of the time. I pick her up every other friday after school and drop her off at school the next monday. My ex-wife has her the majority of the time.  I want to say that Rose has been diagnosed with ADHD. Being a parent with a disabled child is so much harder than having a normal child is. I've made many sacrifices for Rose; I still have to monitor her as if she's 5 and have to make sure she doesn't watch TV unless her homework's done. She also is a bad listener and I have to have extreme patience when dealing with her. I also have to split costs with my ex to pay for a math tutor for Rose because she rarely focuses in class.  Last week I had to pick her up and take her to the grocery store because we needed dinner supplies. I was listing off the dinner ingredients and couldn't remember one. Rose suggested the one I forgot and I told her that was it. She puffed out her chest and said \"No need to thank me\" in a very arrogant way.  We were at a red light, so I turned to her and sternly asked \"Rose, what did you say?\" She mumbled out nevermind. I firmly explained to her that \"That is extremely inconsiderate and disrespectful. I don't owe you anything. I don't have to do half the stuff I do for you, so you need to really think about the way you talk to me and be grateful.\"  Rose (rather insincerely) mumbled out \"sorry\" and was quiet for the rest of the time. She sat in the backseat even when I offered her to sit in the front again. I even offered her ice cream but she said no and would refuse to look at me.  We got home and she did her work (a reading project she was  supposed  to finish in class that day) without me having to monitor her but then didn't want to watch a movie with me. She was really quiet for the entire weekend.  My ex blew up my phone on Tuesday saying she \"knows what you told Rose\" and that I'm a horrible father. My ex is honestly the reason that Rose acts entitled and still has meltdowns. What am I supposed to do? Stop disciplining Rose just because she has a tantrum?  As I said, I make many sacrifices to help Rose. I drive Rose to and from school so she doesn't have to walk the three miles. I buy her toys and other things and just last month I agreed to babysit Rose for three days when ex's mother was in the hospital.  My father was barely in my life. He wouldn't buy me things and would make me walk home. Rose isn't a baby anymore. She's old enough that she needs to learn to be grateful when people do things for her. Because they don't have to and her attitude won't work in the real world. I could have been gentler, but sometimes showing tough love is necessary to correct bad behavior when coddling won't fix it. AITA?  Edit #1: First off, I've read the comments, so you don't need to keep blowing up my DMs calling me a \"cunt.\" Second, you people saying I don't love Rose and should just give up custody are dead wrong. It's because I love her and want her to succeed in life that I set boundaries and correct her behavior. We still do plenty of good things together and even watch an hour of TV together every night she's at my house.\n",
      "so i had this friend and we were extremely close but over the course of about a year she became unbearable to spend time with. she was mean, snarky, passive aggressive and would talk behind my back. it got really bad, to the point that i was terrified to see her and would isolate myself in hopes she would stop. she didn’t.   that lasted for about a year until she “apologized” over text and everything went “back to normal”. a couple months ago i stopped talking to her because she was starting to seemingly revert back to her old actions.   i know she struggles with her mental heath and has validity issues so i’m sure it took a big toll on her, but my life has improved greatly and i’m the happiest i’ve ever been. i sort of ghosted her, and i feel bad because i know this is the sort of thing that would really hurt her. but i’m happy!!! so moral dilemma\n",
      "English is not my first language.  This friend(21f), Jenna isn't really my closest friend or someone I enjoy hanging out with. We went to the same school and have the same group of friends, so that's the only time I see her. I got in a relationship a few months ago and kept it lowkey. I don't like posting stuff on social media because I'm a very private person but only told my best friends and family.  I do post some pictures of the food I eat together with him on my story, but people dont question me cause I go out to eat with my brothers regularly. So Jenna has no idea about me having a bf. And I'm also not comfortable with telling her about him. I trust my bf, but I don't trust her. She's known for flirting with every guy she comes across. And she also slept with a friend’s bf. It was that guy’s fault too, but Jenna knew he was dating our friend and it looked like she did it to show off.   So she saw my bf and me yesterday at a mall(lockdown is lifted) and was excited to see me. She was shocked seeing my bf but thought it was a friend. So she jokingly said,” oh still single OP”. I faked laugh but introduced my bf. I didn't sit to catch up, came up with a lie to leave. That night she called me, but I didn't pick up, so she sent me a message calling me a fake friend for not telling her about my love life. I was tired, so I told her to STFU and leave me alone cause I don't see her as a friend.   Now she keeps tweeting about fake friends and blocked me on every social media. My friends showed me her tweets, and her tweets were all targeting me. She brought up an incident that happened when we were 13. I forgot to bring money, and she paid for my lunch. I paid her back the next day😭😭, but she tweeted something saying ”imagine helping someone when they were hungry, but they don't tell you important stuff  insert sad emojis .”  My bf found this incident funny and told me that it was not my fault for not telling her stuff. My friends also think the same way and said they would do the exact thing I did. But I just want to make sure I'm not the asshole here. Aita???\n",
      "To understand this story I have to describe the lay of the land first.  Picture a medium-sized, open playground for kids. Then a row of benches. Then a small calisthenics park, with a row of bushes separating it from the low-traffic road. Then across the road a fenced dog park. It's designed to be a shared space, so it's common to have parents working out in the calisthenics area while (older) kids hang out in the playground, or have parents let the dog run in the dog park while kids play, etc. Depending on where you come from (obvs) you have to pass the playground to get to the dog park.  Fwiw I've seen dogs both on and off leash approach the dog park, so I have no idea what the local leashing laws are.  There's a regular lady whose dog is just bad behaved. It's not dangerous (thankfully!) but it 'loves kids' and expresses this by running and jumping up on them. I've seen this (unleashed) dog terrify kids and sent them running (not dangerous, but that's impossible to tell when it's racing towards you), straight up knock them over including a toddler on a training bike, and stand under the climbing ropes to excitedly bark at kids high out of reach.  I was sitting on the benches enjoying the sun, when the dog races up to another child who screams for their mom to pick them up. Dog lady comes up after the dog, apologizing and saying 'he just loooooooves kids so much!' I usually don't say anything because not my circus, not my monkey. I was in an off mood today tho, so I snap 'You need to socialize your f*cking dog, or leash it.' The lady was clearly taken aback, and she says 'I *am* socializing it! What do you think I'm doing here?' to which I reply 'I think you're letting your dog terrorize a bunch of children.' She made some indignant noises, I give her my full-on bitch stare, and she grabs the dog to make off towards the dog park. I apologize to the mom for cursing in front of her kid.  I think I'm in the right that this dog needs to be leashed around kids. I don't know anything about dogs, but I'm highly skeptical that letting it run free to bowl kids over is 'socializing' it. HOWEVER it's literally the first time ever I talked to this woman & I think snapping, cursing, and giving her the bitch stare may make me the asshole. Also, again--not my circus so I could have just minded my business.\n",
      "Me(28F) and my friend(26M) have been friends for a little over a year after meeting through a mutual friend group and we got to become close friends.   About a week ago I texted him asking if he wanted to hang out with no response. I tried again the next day, and nothing. Its usually not like him to not respond so I gave him a call and no answer. By day 4 of trying I started to get worried and asked our mutual friends if he was ok and they didn't know either. Yesterday, he gives me a call apologizing for not replying since he was on a trip and wanted to \"unplug\".   Honestly, I was relieved to hear he was ok but I blew up on him and told him how worried I got when he wouldn't pick up the phone. He defended himself saying that he was an adult and didn't need babysitting, but I told him that we were still friends and that I'm allowed to worry if he goes MIA out of nowhere. He said I was being an AH since he was just returning my calls and wasn't in the mood to be chewed out and hung up on me. We haven't spoken since the call.  So AITA here?\n",
      "I (22f) live with my mother (51) and niece (13). Ever since I was 14, I have looked after my niece every day after school until my mum came home. Including weekends when my mum had to work.  Because of this, I never really had my “teenage years” experience as I didn’t have any free time to go out with friends. It got to the point where all of my friends stopped trying to make plans with me because I could never go/had to cancel - which then led to them not talking to me anymore.   I now do not have friends at all. I do not have any social media like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram etc because of my OCD so I can’t even make any online friends either.  I also cannot get a job because I need to be home to look after her.   Recently, there have been a LOT of arguments in the house due to my niece. I won’t go into detail as it’s irrelevant to this post but let’s just say that she is a very difficult child and things have gotten out of hand more than once.  I have been diagnosed with CPTSD and was advised to try and get some time away from them regularly.  I spoke to my family about this and it was agreed that I would have more free time.   My nieces mum (my sister, 30) is now more capable of caring for my niece than she was a few years ago so the plan was that my niece would spend more time with her than with me. Giving me the free time I was recommended and also allowing me a bit of my life back, maybe even a job.   Despite us coming to an agreement on that, it has never happened. Any time I bring it up, there’s always an excuse from someone that ends with me having to watch her anyway. My nieces tantrums always happen over small things (wifi not working, us not having the snack she wants, the top she wants to wear being wet from getting washed etc) so there is no way to prevent or predict them. It causes me extreme stress and always ends badly.   Today one of those tantrums happened and I messaged my sister to ask her to help and maybe watch my niece for a while so I could calm down. This has resulted in her spamming me with aggressive messages saying that I never do anything for anyone and if I’m so bothered by my niece then I should just move out etc. They get worse but I won’t elaborate.   I have no problem with watching my niece but I need a little bit more support when she gets like this and I also need my own personal life.  I also only still live at home to help my mum with my niece and house chores/rent etc as she struggles - I’m not just living here because I’m lazy and refuse to move out. And because I can’t get a job to afford my own place because no one else will step up to look after my niece.   My mum also gets pretty mad when I bring up wanting to have free time to do something. Most of the time it also ends in an argument with her too and then I can’t do what I wanted to.   Long story short, I basically gave up my personal life for 8 years to look after my niece, but now that her mum is more capable and I want some free time, everyone is getting mad at me for asking.\n",
      "My mother has stage 4 lung cancer now and the tumor is growing very rapidly.she survived survical cancer stage 4 in 2019.we didn't know about the tumor until it's diagnosis 2 months ago.she is fighting cancer and undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. She is growing weaker day by day and is unable to eat anything .she is hospitalised for 1 whole month in hospital in these 2 months.i am very much attached to my parents.i got married after my mother survived cervical cancer.i was homesick since my graduation years and went home to be with my parents whenever possible.I already told my husband before marriage that I would like to spend time with my parents whenever possible he was cool with it then.i often went to spend time with my parents once in month for weekends and festivals.i reside with my husband and MIL in another city and work .I used to work at my hometown and live with my parents before marriage.the transfer process to be with my husband was very hard but somehow my father worked it out. After the diagnosis my mom is undergoing treatment in my city . Initially both my husband and MIL were very generous and told my parents to live with us while undergoing treatment.my parents hesitated but gave in when my husband insisted. My dad treats my husband as his son and when doctors told my mother has only a year to live he couldn't take it and often shares his sorrows with my husband.my mind has gone blank after my mom's diagnosis and timeline given by doctors.i don't want to spend time apart from her as I don't know how much time we have with her.i wasn't able to concentrate on anything else these two months and always worried about my mom.My MIL and husband both now say that I am ignoring my husband and not taking care of him and the house . I can't seem to understand how can they say this. How can they think about that I am ignoring my husband when I am suffering with grief of my parents. Both of them said many harsh things that my father married me to this family just so that I can work in this city.how can they be so heartless.my brother is a special needs child he doesn't even know what is happening to my mother.how can they say I am ignoring my husband when I am unable to concentrate on my life due to grief. AITA or am i selfish to be with my parents during these testing times?my parents don't live with us now and moved back to hometown only to visit for chemo.I went to spend 3 days with them as it was my weekend and told both MIL & husband both were cool with it. Its after my return to home they are singing this new tone of ignoring him and house.AITA to be with my parents to support them for few days? Someone please explain because I can't see it.\n",
      "I got back into lifting weights 4 months ago. This is the longest period of consecutive and consistent time that I’ve ever gone to the gym as previously I would just stop consistently going to the gym after 1 or 2 months. One of my friends has recently expressed that she wants to go to the gym with me and, because I was super excited with the idea of having someone to go with, I told her I’d love to take her and show her some exercises.  However, after thinking more about it, I feel that I am still technically a beginner (4-months isn’t that long in the grand scheme of fitness). Because of this, I now don’t feel fully comfortable showing her any exercises as I’m still learning things myself and don’t want to teach her incorrect things that could lead to injury. For example, the other day, I was doing an exercise I’ve done every single day for the past 4 months and realized after working out that I was doing it slightly incorrectly after watching a tutorial video online.   So, WIBTA if I told her I’m definitely still down to go to the gym with her, but don’t feel comfortable attempting to teach her things?\n",
      "Hi all. Obligatory on mobile.   Some backstory to understand the situation a bit better. My (f24) husband (m24) came from a very poor, abusive family, and my grandmother gave him an opportunity to get away from that situation in high school. He rented out a trailer on her property for very cheap and worked while going to school to support himself and send home cash to help feed his siblings.   We took his siblings in multiple times over the last few years on a temporary basis to keep them safe and help them, but we were not in a position to do it permanently, so they always went back home to his mother.   Cue a year and a half ago, we were in a better place financially and my husband’s brother graduated high school. (He is 19, almost 20 now)  We invited him to come live with us, Agreeing that he would pay a small amount of rent, keep his area clean, (a private bedroom and a bathroom that he had to keep clean for guests) help with chores, and do his best to start his education and save up. He wouldn’t have to worry about paying utilities or food unless he wanted something extra for himself. After a year, he would move out and we would be here to help him should anything happen.   At first it went well. He got a job, bought some basic furniture and started paying rent. He didn’t know a lot of hygienic basics, so my husband had to help him with those.  We also ran into other issues like him not knowing how to run a dishwasher or cook or store any food properly, how to pick up after himself or clean anything, those sorts of things. I didn’t blame him for this at all. He came from a very bad living situation and didn’t learn these thing growing up.   It’s been over a year and a half though, and a lot of issues continue. He has ruined a good amount of appliances and borrowed items. He has no social or physical respect for boundaries. He gets in my personal space, often touching me to find out what I’m doing, doesn’t do chores or pay rent unless we remind him multiple times, often trying to take over what we are doing, goes into our room to take things to “borrow” if he knows we aren’t home, mishandles our pets, says inappropriate things, and generally has zero respect for basic rules of common curtesy or the rules we set up.   Uncountable corrections and talks where we bring up specific issues do nothing. He either lies about doing it, or he corrects himself for a day, and goes back to doing the same things. My husband isn’t as bothered by these things as I am. It’s left me wondering if I’m blowing things out of proportions or being totally ignorant of the time and effort it takes to adjust.   I feel like his brother’s constantly disregarding rules, people’s belongings and personal space is a big issue. I feel awful because I watched him grow up and helped raise him at times, he’s like my own brother, but I don’t feel like it is my responsibility to teach him or help take care of him anymore.   Advice and perspective is greatly appreciated.\n",
      "My mom has been trying to get a house for a couple of months now and has had some unexpected costs since this is her first time she didn't know what to prepare for, she has sat me down a couple of times asking for money so she can pay for said unexpected costs, I've been reluctant but have always complied out of guilt and fear, at the moment I have given her a little over $2,000 just for the house, in a few months I plan on moving out and continuing collage I've planned this for years, the last time she asked for more money I began to cry and when asked why I told her that it is putting me in a tight spot and she called me selfish and told me to f off she said I'm 18 and should be helping with the family since I'm a working adult I argued that it's not my job and its hers since she's the parent I also argued that she didn't let me get a job until I graduated because she would guilt me out of it, anyway I've really been thinking about when it is time for me to move out if I should ask for at least some of the money back so I can afford to move and have a nice little chunk to fall back on, I don't plan to have her in my life once I move and I've been debating if I should just keep my mouth shut and continue to give her whatever she asks until I move idk it's just really stressful\n",
      "Backstory: I am an 18 year old boy who has family problems, my mother has ALS which means my dad is taking care of her all the time, so I have never been able to drive with my dad. I drove with him for like, 30 minutes.  That also means I didn't start driving until I was 18 last year in November. And I was having a blast! I was nervous at first, but that’s normal for students.  I did have a break from driving when Christmas came and didn't drive for a few weeks as lessons didn't line up, so it was safe to say, I was rusty with driving. (This is important.)  Now for the story, My driving instructor who will now be referred to as DI, met a few weeks ago and nothing has really gone wrong! A few hiccups here and there with turn signals and whatnot, but that’s expected, I'm new.  I was so afraid of crashing or doing something wrong to damage the car, I am a person who overuses the word \"Sorry\". I mean, I don't want to get in trouble, that's the last thing I want to happen! DI Said something to me during lessons, \"Don't worry, this car is BUILT FOR MISTAKES.\" This quote burned into my mind that \"Oh, I'm new, small mistakes shouldn't matter much because the car is cheap and old.\" Which is true, the car looked really old.  Cue today, and they arrive 10 minutes early, so I quickly get off and rush outside, get inside, and try to pull out of my driveway.  There was a problem though, my dad's car was in the middle of it and when I try to drive out, I get into a bad position, so I think \"Okay, I'll drive just a little forward to try to get out of here\" noticing the tree in front of me, so I let off the brake and the car doesn't move forward automatically because of the snow on the ground, okay... so I press on the gas lightly... at least I try to.  I hear the engine go loud and move my foot to the brake, or at least... I thought I did.  I drove right into the tree.  Mind me, I didn't drive too fast, I don't even think I damaged the car THAT much, but before I could even say a word, before I could say sorry and apologize, DI immediately looks to me  DI: \"Are you a fucking idiot!?\"  Now this... this hurt me HARD instantly, at that moment my mind tries to justify me doing this, and I pipe out  Me: \"B-But I didn't mean to-\"  DI: \"Get out.\"  We bicker back and forth, me trying to apologize and stay in the lesson, as I want to take the lesson! he kept on pushing for me to get out and when I still protested, apologizing more, he yells out  DI: \"Get out now or I will DRAG you out!\"  I picked up my stuff and got out, storming inside in shock and a bit of rage as I tell my dad what happened, and he is in shock that I well, drove into a tree...  He tries to tell me why he would kick me out of the car and everything, saying he would do it too, and I just broke into tears, I hated myself for driving into the tree and cried for 10 minutes straight, saying sorry to dad and everything...  I just stand there, crying my eyes out, only calming down 10 minutes later…  AITA?  Edit: There was someone else in the car than the DI, who is unrelated to the story, it was another student. how our driving lessons work is that either a DI or a student drives into your home, and if there is a student after your lesson you drive to their house to pick them up, and said student drives you home.  I was in a little hurry as i didn't want to keep them waiting too long.  Edit 2: I didn't tell my dad the whole story and left out the idiot part, he is reporting the DI for what he said to me and is trying to sort everything out...  I really don't want lessons to stop because of this bullshit.\n",
      "So, there's a ton of backstory that definitely won't fit here, so I'll simplify.   My mum and dad split when my dad cheated, he was a massive asshole during the whole thing and made my mum very depressed, it was a bad time for everyone. It was years ago, shes better but all my siblings don't mention him unless she's having a laugh at how bad his life is now.  During this, she sent me to live with him since we really couldnt handle eachother (i was ~13-15). He had 2 kids with the lady, I've watched them grow up. I don't hate the kids, they're innocent in this. My mum however, refuses to use any of there names. She calls my dad F1 (f*ckhead 1) ect, and calls the kids 'mongrels' because 'they're from a different womb'. ???  So we all play along, call him F1 ect but I hate referring to the kids as mongrels. I usually just call them 'The Children' to avoid an angry lecture about wombs and stuff. Today though, I don't know what's up but she lost it on me today. I bought one of the kids a toy and just got it in the mail today. I opened it, she asked who was it for, I said 'one of the kids'. She asked who again, so I said 'one of the children up there' (there meaning where they live). She started up with 'oh, the mongrels'. I mumbled 'kids but yeah, okay.'  That was not the right move.  Now she's kicking me out, 'never contact me again', the whole thing. I've got places to stay so that's lucky.  She also drew my other sister into it, who is on my side about this. My other sisters think I shouldn't have said anything about who the mail was for. But I didn't think she'd lose her shit over it? AITA, Should I have just called them mongrels to appease her?  Edit: I just want to state some ages The kids are all below 10 I'm currently 23, all my sisters are older than me\n",
      "This happened today: My roommate comes back from college,   I'm studying sitting at my desk, he wants to close all the curtains and darken the entire room so he can sleep.   but that makes the room too dark to study in, so I open the curtain on my side of the room so I can continue studying.   now this guy flips out on me saying that he has no peace since I arrived.   His reasoning:    I wake up at 6am and walk around the room (I walk to the bathroom so I can brush my teeth)     I don't close the curtains on my side in the afternoon    Now, my point being.   Even after waking up at 6am, I don't turn on the lights in order to not disturb him and use the torch on my phone.    use my headphones again to not disturb him.    he doesn't wanna look at how I adjust in order to not bother him but only look at the aspects which do annoy him  like sure if I look at it that way, him not flushing annoys me but I don't say much,   same for him leaving the bathroom door open everytime he uses the bathroom,  I don't say much because I know even he has to put up with some of my annoyances like me waking up early.  Today when he yelled at me I thought I had enough of his bullshit and asked him to fuck off if he has so many issues with me. (my tone was kinda rude when I said that)  Am I the asshole for asking him to fuck off?\n",
      "So a few months ago my best friend adopted a German shepherd puppy who was only 6 weeks old. For the first few months he didn’t walk him because he didn’t have all of his shots, which ok whatever, but now he has all of his shots and he still doesn’t take him for walks because he says it’s boring. The puppy is also not house trained and frequently has accidents inside, and it doesn’t seem like there’s any effort to correct it. I asked about this and he just brushed it off and implied the puppy should learn on his own.   The puppy frequently bites anyone who tries to play with him or pet him, I’ve tried taking him for walks when my friend is away and he just bites me the entire time I’m putting the harness on him. I’ve asked my friend about this and he’s like “yeah he’s just hyper”. Whenever we go over to his house the puppy has to stay in his crate or outside because he bites everyone.   On top of that, my friend has started going away overnight on occasion and leaving the puppy alone for longer periods each time. The last time the puppy was left alone in the crate for 24 hours with no food or water. AND he doesn’t give the puppy water during the day when he’s alone because he doesn’t want him to pee everywhere...  I’ve asked my friend about puppy training and he said he wasn’t interested in doing that. I’m really bad at confrontation and don’t know what to do without sounding like an asshole but I feel so bad for this dog and am afraid it’s going to continue to have behaviour issues if he’s not trained properly.\n",
      "I know the title probably makes me sound horrible, but there is a lot more to the story.  So my parents had me very late in their lives after a crapton of tries and being told they could not have kids. Well here I am, but my dad was 51 and my mom 45 when I was born.  Despite their age they were amazing parents, loving, caring, strict but fair and they were in a very good financial position in large part due to their age, so they put me through very good schools and paid my tuition to Uni and so on, in other words I had a great youth and was set up for success.  Well I am 26 now, I am doing well for myself, however the problem started 3 years ago. They missed having me in the house, it felt empty they said so they were considering adoption from another country where laws are more lacking as in our country their age would likely prevent them from even being considered, I told them that this was a horrible idea due to thrir age.  Last year they succeeded in adopting a little girl and her brother aged 3 and 5 and I have only met them a few times so far all times they were extremely shy and frankly, I am not close to them at all as I live halfway across the country so obviously I do not consider them my siblings but more so as my parents kids.  Issue is my dad is now 77 and my mom is 71, they are still very fit for their age and have a live in nanny to help out, but lets be honest, they are in the agegroup where it is likely the end is near.  So I visited them a week ago and asked them what their plans were for the kids if they die before they are adults and they were pretty much lost for words, looked confused and answered \"Obviously you will take them in, you are their brother.\" I pretty much had the same rwaction as they had to my question and told them there was no way, I hardly know them, I am not close to them, I do not consider them my siblings and I certainly wont take care of two kids.  Went over about as well as you can expect, loads of yelling and screaming which led to me leaving, I have not spoken to them since apart from my mom sending me messages to reconsider. Obviously I do feel bad though, there is no one else who can take care of them, no other family, no close friends, just me, so they'll end up in the foster system. But Am I the Asshole?\n",
      "Long story short i've [19F] never had a good bond with my parents [Both well in their 50s] because of mental health issues they didn't support me with and a weird mix between being overprotective over me and me being 'adult enough to figure stuff out myself' in their eyes. Living with them made my depression much, much worse and made me feel like shit in general. That and not having many friends really got the worst of me for a while.   Lately, i've got a loving and supporting boyfriend [21M] who i've been childhood friends with 10 years ago. Basically i stayed over at his place for a night and never left, and have now been unofficially living with him for almost 5 months.  My parents want me to come home (Which i do around biweekly) or just look for a place for myself but because of my mental and physical health issues it's just not the smartest thing to do. My parents now keep bugging me for small stuff (Claiming i've been breaking their stuff when i'm over, guilt tripping me for taking care of me for all those years) and now i've had a small fight with my brother [15] and they want me to come over to talk it through tomorrow evening. I told them i couldn't, because i have a concert and just generally don't feel like it. Me and my bro worked it out already so i don't feel the need to. She basically told me \"If you think a dumb concert is more important than your family you can just fuck off\" which basically made something snap in me and i said okay and hung up the phone.  I don't think i'll have much contact with them anymore now and i know it hurts my parents a lit because they do care about me. The years of physical abuse and gaslighting/other forms of manipulation just made me so tired and scared of my parents i seriously don't feel at home ( or even comfortable) around them anymore to the point of having suicidal thoughts. AITA for cutting them off?  Tldr; My parents have been unsupportive / manipulative for years and are guilt tripping me for living with my boyfriend instead, making me feel so much happier. AITA for cutting them off?\n",
      "I am a supervisor at a warehouse and currently work 3rd shift (overnight crew) today I found out that on Thursday, Christmas Eve, 1st and 2nd shift would be working 6 hours instead of the regular 8 that they are scheduled. When I found out about this I texted my boss asking if that meant we would only be working 6 hours Wednesday night into Thursday as we are off Thursday night for the holiday just as the other two shifts are off Friday. The exact response I got was “nope”. Would it be wrong of me to tell my shift how they are being treated unfairly and working their full schedule when the other shifts are not, along with telling them I have no explanation for why this is and they should bring up concerns with the general manger himself?  Edit: I would not be trying to use my employees as a cop out for having a conversation with my boss. More than once have they voiced concerns about things that I have brought up to him and they have more or less been ignored and never addressed. This is the only way I feel I can get him to see his unfairness and what could be called favoritism towards the other two shifts. Our schedules don’t align much as I leave early morning and it’s rare he comes into work before I leave as he more or less sets his own schedule.\n",
      "I share an apartment with my girlfriend. We have two cats. One of the cats is allowed outside, but the other one has a habit of evading capture lol. The last time this cat got out I was up until 4am trying to catch them. This cat got out the other night while My girlfriend was sleeping. I tried for several hours to get them in but could not Succeed. I woke my girlfriend to tell her the situation and that, if I couldn’t catch the cat before 2am, I would be going to bed. I must’ve said this to her 100 times and even took a video so I was sure she had heard and understood me. Well, I went to bed and we woke up the next morning and the cat was no longer in the backyard. It took us 2 hours to find the car and bring them home. My girlfriend is livid with me and said I didn’t do enough to catch the cat. I reminded her of what I told her that night and I showed her the video of her agreeing to what I said. She responded that she doesn’t care about the video because she was half asleep and I should’ve just gotten the cat. I feel like it’s a shared responsibility when this happens and I wasn’t staying up all night on my own while I had work the next day! We are glad the cat is home now, but things have been tense between us for about two days now and we haven’t really Spoken to each other. So, AITA?\n",
      "My (19M) parents separated when I was 7 and they had new partners at some point. My mother (42F) moved in and had a daughter (6F) with her old high school boyfriend (41M) , who’s now my stepdad. He has an annoying and compulsive tendency to lecture and finds the smallest reasons to do so. Small reasons like leaving the lights on at the bathroom, or not placing some of the bathroom equipment like a razor at unnecessarily specific places where he wants them placed. He lectures a lot of people. The list includes me, my mother, his son (14M) from a another woman, my sister (15F), my mother’s employees, the babysitters my mother hired, and even my cousin (9M). And that’s not even half the people he lectures.  So, today I got fed up with it during dinner, he tried to force his beliefs on me and lecture me again this time about the importance of praying because I don’t pray before or after I eat. I’m an atheist, because I don’t like the concept of a god or an afterlife. I snapped back at him and told him (in exact terms because I have near-perfect memory \"Shut the fuck up. I’m fed up with your lectures. You’re not my father, you’re not my teacher. You have no right to lecture me on my beliefs or lecture me at all.\" He got pissed off because this is one of the few times he failed to lecture someone and went outside seething. He’s currently outside smoking and demanding an apology but I’m not giving him any whatsoever.  AITA?\n",
      "My dad's girlfriend will be distance teaching in the fall at the high school level, and since I am also a high school student, she asked me what would make stuff easier from a student perspective. I told her a bunch of things, like not forcing students to turn their cameras on, being understanding of technical difficulties, and being regularly available for office hours and being more responsive to emails.  I also added that I really appreciated that some teachers were more flexible with deadlines and made projects/tests/homework easier. As soon as I said that, my dad's girlfriend said there was no way she was going to do that. I told her she was an awful teacher if she didn't consider that there's a pandemic, systemic racism, and basic needs insecurity going on.   She told me that life was hard and that their parents were supposed to provide them with a good environment to focus on their studies. She also said that life wouldn't always be as flexible as it is in high school and that they'll have to step up when life gets hard later on. So AITA?\n",
      "First time poster. This happened this morning and I'm still fuming about it several hours later.   My son needed a doctor's appointment, so my husband made the appointment. After making the appointment he reminded me there was still a balance due and he'll pay it when he takes our son in for his appointment. I told him not to pay it and I do not agree with what they billed for and I told the front desk lady last week when I was there for my daughter's appointment and she told me to call the insurance company and she'll make a note in the system that I'm handling it.  Well at 7:30am I get a call from the Doctor's office. I answered it and it was the billing rep for the office demanding I make the payment right now because my husband agreed to pay the balance and now he is refusing. I said, my husband was unaware that I'm handling this with the insurance company because I do not agree with what you charged me for and I spoke to the front desk lady about it last week. The billing rep then said she is not responsible for who is responsible for what in my household and I need to take care of this right now! I'm not kidding, she was yelling at me over the phone. I was so taken back and raised my voice back that your office continues to charge me for well visits/vaccine visits when they should be covered 100%! She told me they code the claims and send it to the insurance company and they have an agreed upon amount they can charge me for visits. I said I understand that but you are charging me for well visits when I know my insurance covers those. She then said to me \"I see right here that you and your husband both work for \"said insurance company\" so you both should know how claims work!\" I was so floored by what she said that I calmly responded that neither of us works for or has anything to do with the claims department. She started yelling some more about some nonsense and I just hung up. I couldn't take it anymore.   By her logic, when the doctor is behind, she could step in and see children and write prescriptions because she works in a doctor's office. Completely stupid assumption, right?  When my husband got home I told him about what happened. He said I need to call the office manager immediately and  report what this billing rep just said to me. I said I will call, but I need to calm down first or I know I won't handle it well. He said I should call when I'm fired up. But I decided to wait. He also wants us to switch pediatricians now because he thinks their staff is very unprofessional now. I was telling my mom about the incident and she thinks while the rep should not have said that to me and I shouldn't have hung up on her. So AITA for hanging up while being insulted and yelled at by a ped's office billing rep?\n",
      "I set up to do graduation photos (college) for a co-worker's daughter. I am a hobbyist, so I only do portraits for friends and family.   I had not met the daughter before, but I really enjoy her mother (the coworker) so I gave her a good deal and encouraged her to bring props.   The daughter ended up bringing a confetti cannon, which shot hoards of plastic confetti. I agreed on two conditions. 1) That is was the last thing we did and 2) That we would pick up every single piece of confetti. I was not about to leave trash everywhere.  She seemed to think I was kidding, so after the POP, I got to work picking up pieces. She helped but made it clear that she wasn't really pleased and only doing it because I insisted.   Part of me wants to charge more because picking up the confetti made me go over my time (I charge more if the shoot goes longer and definitely make this clear up front.) But I definitely feel that's an asshole move.   Idk AITA for making a big deal out of some confetti or should I just avoid this in the future?  Edit for clarification: Mom (coworker) was not present during the photoshoot\n",
      "So my ex and I dated for over 2 years, in that time I got a puppy. It was my choice to get him, I paid for him and trained him. She moved in when he was 9 months old. We've now broken up. She has moved out and wants to be able to see him every other weekend until she gets her own dog. I understand that he was a part of her life when she lived with me, but I feel like we should both just move on from this relationship and leave my dog out of this. Aita for not letting her see my dog? She took him on a few walks and stuff after we broke up, and got to say goodbye.\n",
      "I 25(f) and my husband 40 (m) are expecting a baby in 7 weeks. My MIL has severe anger issues. She's the kind of Mom that thinks that no woman is good enough for her son. She's the reason for almost all my my husband's break ups in the past. His exes not being able to stand her verbal abuse. Im not an exception.  Previously, my SO, BIL and her lived together. I only stay over, despite being married to her son, on the weekends to avoid friction with her. I would stay over on weekends, clean, do some laundry, walk her dog, etc. On these occasions she has complained about me to her dog, in my presence using profanity, insulting my upbringing, my looks, or just calls me stupid. She ensures that there isn't a place for me during meal times, by placing the trash bag filled with rubbish on the one empty seat at the table. I have to wait till she and her sons are done eating before I its my turn. That's not all, there have been occasions when she fed a portion of my food to the dog while I was waiting for my turn to eat. Basically leaving me with the dogs leftovers.  As my pregnancy has come with a lot of complications, my SO has since moved into my place to take care of me. We still go back on the weekends to visit her and keep her company, as my BIL is working really long hours and despite all my previous experiences with her, I don't want to deprive her of the chance to spend time with my SO. Even though she still makes those days that I'm there pretty difficult for me. I don't even pee in the day, just so I don't have to walk past her room and risk being screamed at.  These things don't happen so much when SO is around because he's already warned her not to make me so miserable especially while I'm pregnant. But they do happen whenever we are alone. But I wont complain about it to him or my family either, they know she's not the easiest person to get along with, but I don't tell them the extent of the things she's done because I don't want to sow any discord.  Now, she's sick enough to require pretty constant care. Everybody knows and everybody feels so terrible for her. Even my family has been putting pressure on me to move in with her and take care of her. BIL would love that even more so he wouldn't have to be the one she yells that all the time. BIL thinks I'm being TA and that I'm selfish because I won't move in with her to care for her. But I am 32 weeks into a difficult pregnancy, and considering all the things she's done to me despite me making an effort time and time again when all she does is just degrade me and hate me. It looks like I'm being petty, but all that abuse throughout the time my SO and I have been together has done some pretty extensive damage to my self worth.  AITA, just I dont want to torture myself through the last stage of my pregnancy?\n",
      "We bought a large home with a separate in-law suite. To house my parents when they are too old to take care of themselves. In the interim we decided to rent out the area to a friend (we’ll call her Susan) and get a little extra income from it. We told her we planned on getting a couple of kittens (before she moved in) as our cat had passed earlier that year and we were missing furry friends other than our dog. We had her go down to the area and walked around above her as well as talked and played with our dog so she knew the level of noise to expect.   Susan moves in and almost immediately starts complaining about the noise. One or two friends sitting in our kitchen having a normal inside voice conversation at 2pm on a Saturday? Text message asking us to move to a different room. Sister in law brings her young son to visit for a few hours 6-8pm on a Tuesday. Text message. Playing with dog for a few minutes after work? Text message. Cats playing around at night? Text message. I could elaborate more but after several concessions on our end and repeated attempts to make the situation better including locking our cats up at night and avoiding that area of the house as much as possible. Also, advising her when we were expecting guests etc. We even went down to hear what it sounded like.   Eventually we had a talk so we could keep the peace. We listed out all the things we had done to remedy the situation. We underlined that she needed to be reasonable and while we can understand that noise travelled this was our home and we were just going about our lives. We politely reminded her that we were charging her extremely low rent for the space and amenities and it would be cool if she was a bit more understanding. We never said a word to her about anything her or her guests have done, including her boyfriend living with her on and off and the fact that we were covering all the utilities. We suggested noise canceling headphones and ear plugs but were not willing to change our behavior anymore. She bought the headphones and things calmed down for a bit, as she couldn’t even hear my voice calling her from a few feet away.  Eventually we stop locking the cats in the guest room at night as we bought furniture for that area and having a litter box in there was no longer an option. All is well for a while until I wake up at 7AM to a text message complaining about the cats again. I made it clear that I draw the line at being bothered with issues so early in the morning and we could discuss it later that day. I texted her a couple hours later that we would be running errands and could discuss it after. She responded telling me “Do not speak to me today”. Thinking that was childish I said “No, I don’t do that/this.”, to which she replied “Refer, to my previous message”. At this point I and my wife were over it so I said “We don’t have to talk if you leave. You’ve paid through the end of the month. Two weeks”.   AITA for telling her to go?\n",
      "So me (21F) and both my parents (43F) and (42M) just got into an argument after my little brother (12M) said he didn’t want to play in a dnd campaign with the family. My mom got upset at my brother and after he asserted that he didn’t want to play, both my parents got fed up and started ranting about how he was being selfish and he doesn’t do anything for the family.  They threatened to ground him from any electronics for a month if he continued “to have that attitude”. He left for his room obviously upset. I was really annoyed at my parents and told them that they weren’t making for a environment that was conducive to having fun with each other. My mom kept arguing that he was being selfish and that if he just played with us the argument would never have happened. We continued arguing until my mom had enough and stormed of to her room.   I went to look for my brother in his room to make sure he was ok, but he wasn’t there. After looking around I found him out side visibly upset. I hugged him and could feel him crying on my shoulder and I took him inside. After a wile of siting in the living room with my siblings, my little brother asked me if he could sleep at our grammas house (she lives next door). Not wanting to get her involved I told him he could sleep in my room and that calmed him down a bit.  After we had dispersed to our rooms my parents came out looking for us. I objected asking what they wanted (I was worried that they were going to continue to berate my brother), but they insisted, so all my siblings gathered into the living room. They started by asking us what we thought were our rights as their children. Me and my siblings weren’t sure what they were trying to do, and so after a nobody answered i told them how my brother was feeling. When I told them they didn’t seem to care and insisted that we answer their question. We started listing things that they needed to legally provide to us as their children, although they we quick to remind us that me and my next older brother were adults and didn’t have that legal protection. After some more of that they started talking about how they don’t make us do a whole lot and that they provide so much for us and that when they were kids they didn’t have nearly as much freedom as we do. They went on, but I objected pointing out again that they were really upsetting my little brother who was visibly crying. They ignored it like before and continued lecturing us.   At this point they started talking about how they do to make us happy and that we don’t show any gratitude or any way of showing that we love them. After all of it I was emotionally exhausted and had just sort gave up on arguing. My parents continued for awhile until my brother left the room and we all decided to go to bed.   I’m just really frustrated that they refuse to acknowledge that they were making their 12 year old son feel like absolute shit, and focused completely on how they felt. Am I right to be upset or am I the asshole.\n",
      "I’m at a moral conundrum here and was hoping to hear an outside perspective.   I’ve been married for 3.5 years, my wife has a son from a previous marriage. He is 13 years old and has the same appetite that I did when I was 13, which is to say, he eats like a pig in a dirt factory.   I am a manual laborer and the only one who works in the house after my wife had our baby who’s now just turned 2. Finances are a LOT better than they could be because I inherited my family home and we both own our cars, but you know, I’m poor so we aren’t doing great. I frequently skip lunch and breakfast and just drink water so my wife and the 2 kids can eat well, and I’ll usually just have dinner instead. I came home from work last night and helped my wife finish up dinner which was steak and potatoes and broccoli.   There was enough steak to go around and there was some spare too. I went ahead and ate what was on my plate but I was still hungry when I was done. By this point my wife had left baby with me so she could go for a bath, and as I went to grab the last steak which was on the plate and my stepson said ‘uh, that’s mine, mom said I could have it’ I gotta admit, I didn’t even think. I said sorry kid, you can have all the cheesy potatoes and broccoli in the world and I’ll let you have an extra desert but this steak ain’t going in your belly.   I ate it, and I’m glad I did because I was absolutely ravenous. My wife was majorly upset with me that night and told me I had disrespected her and her son as well as her decision making. She told me she gave me the biggest steak and that should have been enough. I apologized to her honestly and meant it, but I told her I also felt disrespected because she KNOWS I don’t eat anything apart from dinner to try and make sure the kids don’t have to go without and I shouldn’t have to go hungry for my main meal for a 13 year old.   AITA?\n",
      "I ( f29) understands the question its self would make me the A-hole but hear me out. My Grandfather passed in February of this year and we had his funeral back in June. From the time he passed till the time of the funeral I was the main person doing things. I cleaned his room and went through his clothes, I do not live in that house he and my Mother (46) lived in the same house. I'm also expected to go to her house to finish going through all of his things and pack up some of his things she doesn't want to get rid of.  I planed, made the flower arrangements, bought and cooked/baked all the food. His life insurance covered his cremation and the church rental that's it. I paid for his urn ( she didn't tell me what size to grab for him) , 3 necklaces (only 2 for family 1 for someone he used to babysit, then she babysat when my mother and uncle were younger) and made sure there was a notice about the funeral. My mother, who I had to force to do this, was in charge of making sure people were invited to it, I made the Facebook group so all she had to do was send out the invitations. When his Urn came in I was only able to actually fit just over half of him in there, I also filled all 3 necklaces. On the day of the funeral I find out not only did she not want my uncle, her brother, to attend she made it a point to make sure he was out of town and told him day of the funeral when/where it was. All the way up to this point I was just to busy to remember to tell her I couldn't fit all of my Grandfather in the urn I got him. I want to give my uncle some of his fathers ashes so he has a bit of his father with him. I grew up with my Grandfather as more of a parent then my own parents so I would also like to keep some of him.  I just want to know if I am the A-hole for keeping this from her?\n",
      "Not sure if this is the right sub for this, so please redirect me if there is a better one.  Also note that this is a (hopefully) hypothetical scenario, but one I can not stop thinking about.  The long and short of it is that my dad is reworking his will after learning his prostate cancer spread into his stomach.  Everything is looking as good as it can right now for him, but through this whole process I found that my grandfather passed to my dad a hundred or so shares in JP Morgan.  These would be passed to me in his will.  This is a company I truly despise.  They are nothing but garbage imo and their board members deserve to be thrown to the mob.  So my problem is, am I an asshole for accepting money if it is generated from this company?  I would most likely sell immediately, but does it make me an asshole if I am also refusing to do business with the company in my day to day?  Anywho, if you guys know of a better sub for this, please lmk.  Thanks.\n",

      "I work at a hospital that hires a lot of young people with developmental disabilities to do things like stocking materials, cleaning, and working in the cafeteria. I think this is great. However, I have had some issues with one woman who works in the cafeteria. I go down there for lunch daily, and at first when she started, she was responsible for filling people’s drinks at the machine. When Covid restrictions relaxed, people could fill their own drinks again, so they assigned her to the main cafeteria line. This immediately slowed the line down a LOT, because she could not work quickly during the lunch rush. The bigger problem, though, is that she doesn’t seem capable of judging appropriate quantities of things to put on a plate. For example, she was working the salad bar, and when I asked for onion, she literally grabbed a giant handful of onions and threw them on my salad. This was probably a literal cup of onions or more. Same thing happens with any kind of condiment, so I don’t even ask. She also has some social challenges, and she’ll often stand there talking or telling jokes for a prolonged time when people are just trying to order their food. I know the cafeteria manager, and I have thought about mentioning it to him, but my boyfriend says IWBTA because “they’ll figure it out eventually”. I‘ll probably just leave it alone, but I definitely alter what I am going to get based on whether she is in the line or not, and I imagine a lot of other people do too. WIBTA?\n",
      "So Im going to uni as a physics major and so is my boyfriend and hed known about this since we were in highschool doing A-levels together.  Today, he found out that I wanted to go into nuclear weaponry and he was outraged. I thought he was joking at first because i was almost certain he was aware of this considering the amount of times i expressed my love for the radioactivity topic and isotopes, what not yk. He thought it was just some joke and i guess today he found out that i was fr.  i should mention hes super political and against this sorta stuff and i am too but i just am really fascinated by this sort of stuff!! i ended up telling him that his politics shouldnt get in the way of MY job. he said that yes, they shouldnt but this case is an exception seeing as my job contributes to endangering humanity but i think hes just blowing it out of proportion.   firstly i know NOTHING about bombs, that is not what they teach us and id be going in completely new Ive only begun uni recently and Ive still a long time to go. He ended up calling me a piece of shit to which i didnt reply. got me thinking, maybe my career choice is wrong? i mean he is a serious pacifist but honestly i dont think im in the wrong? maybe? idk im morally conflicted.  tl;dr political bf says i shouldnt go into nuclear weaponry\n",
      "Ok I(35f) am pretty heated at my spouse (37m) right now. He woke me up at 6:05 am to tell me he was “sick” and was going to call in. He is an hourly paid construction worker and we are already in a bind after just moving 2 weeks ago. So that means his check will definitely only be 32 hrs instead of the 40 hours I have budgeted for, unless he works on Saturday (which isn’t guaranteed). He has a bad habit of calling in on Mondays, like for 7 years. So it’s really difficult for me to believe he is actually sick enough to NOT have to go to work. He is getting upset that I’m so irritated, but I see it from the financial standpoint. Today is my first day back at my job so I was hoping to sleep in another hour. But I get woken up with this mess. I’m really trying to keep calm honestly. Sorry for formatting.  AITA?\n",
      "So a friend from uni and I started doing physical activities during covid, we started biking which is “my sport” and then running which is “their sport” we’ve been doing it on and off for 2 years now and everything is great, then 2 months ago they told me about this running group they found, I was not sure at first cause I couldn’t keep up with them during short runs, but a month ago I said, “I’ll try.”   To both our surprise I kept up, 5k-8k, uphill I ran with a decent consistent pace and sometimes I even overtook him. The group runs are 3 times a week and I was having so much fun I start going all 3 times and was getting better at it and meeting all the regulars.   Then my friend 2 days ago send me long texts that basically say “this group is my sanctuary, and you’re my friend from a different part of my life, and I want to keep this group separate from all other aspects of my life. You coming so often makes me uncomfortable, so could you not go so much?”  I was taken by surprise frankly and we talked for a bit and the last thing I said was “this group now means something to me, I’ve never felt healthier and happier with going to the gym and running too, but I respect your boundaries. I’ll hold off from going for a while and try to run on my own, but I’m a herd person, I run best when I see people around me running. So if I feel my progress slipping, I’ll come back, how’s that?” They said that I will lose progress & come back for sure so my suggestion is pointless, then said that me potentially doing this means that I don’t respect their boundaries and that the run to me means more than our friendship. We held back before things got heated.   So AITA for that suggestion and not flat out accepting not going?  Few points: •The group is public anyone can join, and NEITHER of us is an organiser. • I have seriously bad body image issues and the consistency of this group helped me lose weight and feel better about myself. • They were in this group 1 month before I joined and they suggested it to me back then on their own. • I only joined when they brought it up again on their own accord when I came back from a trip. • I’ve never seen them talk about something this seriously, so I know this means a lot. • they suggested that me occasionally going would work for them. But I don’t like being forced tip toe around that while they’re dismissing how I feel.\n",
      "This is such a petty story but I need to ask someone else’s opinion because I’ve been made out to be the bad guy. For some context, my boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been together for a little over 6 years. I adore him and I couldn’t ask for any better, he’s amazing. He works as a landscaper with his Uncle until he’s saved up enough to start his own business, which he absolutely loves and is great at his work. Now for the story. When the COVID regulations started calming down here in the UK, my boyfriend offered to do some work on my mother’s (55F) garden which was definitely needed, so he went ahead with it and the garden turned out gorgeous. My mother has some bad joint pain issues so she couldn’t sort the garden herself and she loves sitting outside to read her books in the summer so she was thrilled. My boyfriend told her that all she needed to do (in consideration with her joint pains) to keep it looking good was cut the grass every few weeks and put weed killer around the path going up our garden, just nice easy steps that wouldn’t be too difficult for her, which she agreed on. 2 years later and she’s not done a single bit of care for the garden, she’s dumped loads of old furniture and waste around it, hasn’t cut the grass, basically the garden is just a mess again full of waste and rubbish. The other day she asked my boyfriend if he could redo the garden like he did last time. I asked her if she’d been keeping on top of what my boyfriend told her to do, which I already knew the answer to, she said “no, but why would I when I’ve got a landscaper in the family?”. Bare in mind she doesn’t expect to be charged for any of the work my boyfriend does because she’s family. I told her that either she pays him for his work or she actually takes care of the garden like he told her to, because he’s not going to keep doing this for free when she’s not making the effort to keep it tidy. I explained the situation to my boyfriend and I told him not to do the work my mother’s requesting, and he agreed. He’d already seen the state of the garden and told my mother himself that he’s not doing it again unless she can keep it clean. She called me afterwards to let me know that she’s hiring her own new landscaper who will be “more fair” than us. I asked her why she agreed on doing little things to keep it tidy if she felt like she couldn’t, we could’ve compromised on something else. Her reply was “I expect family to help me out, I shouldn’t have to do anything I don’t want to do especially in my own house or garden”. She’s now not talking to me or my boyfriend. AITA?  Update:  Wow! Thanks so much for the response. As for an update, she still isn’t talking to me, but I’ve spoken to my sisters and they all agree with me, they’re going to try and talk some sense in to her as I don’t want to poke the bear lol! I’ll keep everyone posted.  Update 2: Hi! Thank you for the continued response, it’s been very reassuring seeing all the comments. So, my oldest sister Ashleigh had the chance to talk to my mother around 2 days after I posted the first update as she was dropping some things off to her. Ashleigh explained everything to her perfectly from what she told me, saying that no one should be expected to do free work on the term that they’re “family”, to which my mother basically responded “well on my side of the family, we’ve all helped each other out for free if it’s our job in general and I expected and hoped for that to carry on”. Ashleigh was firm and told her she couldn’t expect these things without playing her part too, and that we just want to talk things out with her so there’s no bad blood. After a lot of convincing (Ashleigh described it as like talking to a brick wall for the most part 😂), she eventually agreed to having a phone call with my boyfriend and I. We called her the next day and to our surprise she apologised and said she’ll start paying, saying that she had a good think about it once Ashleigh had left her house. My boyfriend has always offered a decent discount for family/friends, so he offered the same to my mother which she was pleased with. So happy days! As for the questions asking “how did she dump old furniture/rubbish outside if she had problems with her joints?”, my boyfriend did ask her about it during the phone call and she explained that the rubbish bags she would dump herself, furniture was only dumped when someone else was in the house too (she does have friends over the house a lot when she’s not working). Again, thank you everyone for the advice. Happy gardening! Lol\n",
      "16M, and there's a girl I know, let's call her Carmen [16F]. She's a hella salty, sarcastic person and tends to snark at everyone. General douchebag-type energy. I wouldn't call myself a mean person in general, but if someone insults me, I'll respond.  &#x200B;  Anyways, I play golf pretty competitively, and also soccer and lax for my school, and I'd say I match the stereotype for golf/soccer/lax players in my area- white, preppy, rich-ish, etc. Carmen (who is white and rich herself lol) makes fun of me for this a lot. At first I just really ignored it, but as time went by it got really really annoying. So today, when she insulted me, I just asked if she played any sports. She said volleyball (I knew she did, just asked to make sure), and I responded by saying, 'oh, that sport that people only go to watch girls shake their asses?'  &#x200B;  This pissed her off a lot, and she said it was 'offensive' and 'gross' of me to say that. I don't see anything wrong with what I did, since a) she shouldn't dish it if she can't take it, and b) what I said is mostly true- most guys who come to girls volleyball games at my school do so just to stare at the girls.   &#x200B;  AITA? If she didn't want to be insulted, she shouldn't make fun of me imo.\n",
      "So, I (24f) have been dating my boyfriend (24m) since September 2017.  We love each other very much and have a very good restionship, with great communication and understanding. I recently received the opportunity through my company to take 1 year abroad to work from one of their offices in Europe. I told my boyfriend about this opportunity and he was extremely upset, saying that it would hurt our relationship to do so. I agree, if I took this opportunity it wouldn’t be easy, but as it is a once in a lifetime opportunity (in my opinion) I feel like I would be missing out on a great opportuniy if I didn’t take it.  I obviously would want to keep dating him and would put in effort to make it work. It also is only one year, which in the time scheme of our relationship, I feel like isn’t much. A couple years ago when we graduated college I had accepted a job in Michigan and actively encouraged him to apply to jobs in whatever state he wanted, because I didn’t want to hold him back, even though I knew it might cause strain on our relationship.  He has said that if I took this opportunity, it would be the “beginning of the end” of our relationship, even though whn roles were reversed I was nothing but encouraging.  Am I the asshole for wanting to accept this opportunity to work abroad for one year, even though it may put my relationship at risk?\n",
      "Just a little context, I am a 16 year old girl. My parents have probably been split for a solid 4 years now and because of the constant arguing and me already having self esteem issues i blamed myself for the breakup. After the breakup my mom gained full custody of me and my at the time 15 brother (my brother isn't my dads son hes just my half brother) but my mom would make us stay over at his house for every single day aside from weekends. My dad was happy with it since he sees my brother as his son as well due to taking care of him since he was 2. Once she found a house we moved in with her and she had told us her fiance which my brother and I haven't known for very long before him moving in. Immediately there was problems such as him yelling at me and my brother for being lazy even though he was the one that never took care of the house due do his \"breathing problems\" even though he is still a very avid smoker. He also took the door knob off of my door and would regularly walk into my room without knocking, causing him to walk in on me changing multiple times without apologizing.   Skip forward to December of 2018, my brother turned 18 in January of 2018 and moved out so i was all alone in the house. My dad gains custody of me. It was one of the happiest times of my life. court date was on a Wednesday so my dad told me to stay the rest of the week and he will pick me up on Saturday. But as soon as my mom got home she tried to guilt me saying I don't love her yada yada yada.   All seemed fine at my dads, his girlfriend moved in prior to me staying there full time and she seemed like a nice person and so did her family. Boy was I wrong. September 2018 is when i started dating my boyfriend that I am still dating right now. My dad gave me a lot more freedom than my mom did so i tried to spend as much time with my boyfriend as I can and my dad seemed fine with it, i made sure that he met my boyfriend and his parents. But for the past i want to say 6 months my stepmom started to get on me. If i didn't put away a single dish that was in the sink I would get yelled at. If i didn't have breakfast with them on the weekends because i would eat something prior to them waking up, i'd get yelled at. It turned into a vicious cycle of her and I arguing her accusing me of stealing her stuff and her always insulting my mother and my boyfriend and my life decisions. I'll admit that I have a very bad attitude but she is more of a \"I'm going to ruin her life in secret\" person. Now my boyfriend dropped out of high school mid sophomore year but I know he is very smart and very much wants to go to college after getting his GED. He is working full time and has a truck and his license. He is a very hard worker and he worked for everything he has now, being born to a mother with very bad bipolar disorder and an injured navy veteran. Because of her strong judgments towards my boyfriend and his parents, she started to push it onto my dad. And my dad listens to her. I don't want to say my dad is a pushover but he sure as hell believes every little thing that woman shoves down her throat. It's gotten to the point where my dad will find any reason for me to not go over to my boyfriends house and even flat out said that he will not help me pay my college tuition if i move out of the house when i turn 18 knowing if me and my bf are still together by then, that is my exact plan.   Where I live the legal age of working is 16 and i turned 16 in October. I was job hunting and i still am trying my best to find a job so I am able to be financially independent as soon as i'm 18. Now it's February 2019 and I have still yet to find a job although i do have an interview next week. My dad is forcing me to apply for different jobs, not acknowledging that most places don't want to hire people that are still in school especially not a 16 year old. But he says I'm grounded until I find one. My self esteem and my motivation have lowered and it has gotten to the point where I don't think I want to live here anymore but I also wouldn't want to go back to my mother. AITA for possibly blowing things out of proportion? Am i just over reacting?\n",
      "Today I took my two granddaughters 2 1/2 yr and 9 months to a small public park. A woman arrived with 6 daycare kids and her middle school age son. The kids were all playing fine except for being told not to throw wood chips. My granddaughter was playing on a single twirling toy when one of the kids starting throwing wood chips at her. I told him to stop and that throwing wood chips was not a good idea as someone could get hurt. He said nothing but three of the children all said to me at the same time, he gets to do whatever he wants. I told the three kids that he shouldn’t throw wood chips and it’s a basic rule at parks to not throw things at other kids. The three kids argued with me that it didn’t matter because the boy was a toddler and he gets to do whatever he wants. The adult in charge of them asked me what was going on, she was on the other side of the playground equipment and didn’t see or hear this. I explained and her response was to tell me to not talk to her kids and if I had a problem, to come to her. Was I the AH today? Are other adults not allowed to talk to other children at the playground? I was protecting my granddaughter, I didn’t raise my voice and was not angry with them. But maybe I was suppose to remove my girls rather than talk to the kids?\n",
      "I'm 16m and she's 11f. She and I had a decent relationship when she was little but once she hit like 5 years old she became so annoying. She will always comment on stuff you're not doing perfectly, even when you don't ask, she's intrusive (inviting herself into stuff all the time), she doesn't give space when you ask for it and in the last couple of years she has become obsessed with watching me while I play video games, and commentating on how badly I'm doing. I know from friends of mine that she does the same with her own friends and has been pushed out of her friend group because of it. It's consistent too.  I have tried telling her to stop before and explaining why it's annoying. I have even tried to get my parents to understand. They would always tell me it's not  that bad  and I should accept her how she is. Because they were pissed about her being excluded from her friend group and even confronted other parents about it. She was really upset all her friends stopped talking to her and including her.  Example: I was playing a horror game Saturday. In my room. With the door shut. She barges in and doesn't leave when I ask her to and our parents tell me to let her stay and watch. There was a section I was having a hard time with and spent a couple of hours on. She kept telling me I was doing it wrong, I was bad at the game, that I was dying repeatedly. Over and over she would say the same thing. I told her I knew. She'd say something like I should stop if I'm that bad. I told her it was about having fun. In the end I got so tired of her that I stopped playing and went to a friends house.  That sort of stuff happens all the time. She is downright distracting and takes all the fun out of it.   What happened was Saturday night I decided to play some more because she was doing something else. But she heard me or something because she came in. I decided to stop playing. She told me she had come to watch. I said I knew but was done. She then wanted me to help her make some Halloween crafts. I said no. She told me I had to do something or how else could she hang out with me. I replied that I didn't want to hang out with her. She got upset. Our parents asked what was going on and they scolded me for upsetting her. I said I was not going to ruin Saturday night by doing something with her so that she could pick at how bad I am the whole time. They told me I was being mean. My sister started crying and said she's only trying to help. I told her she's been told so many times it doesn't help, is annoying and she still won't stop.  She got even more upset and then my parents told me I was cruel and should love and accept my sister as she is. I should note, she has no special needs. She just has this habit that was never really corrected by our parents and everyone else is supposed to deal with it.  AITA?\n",
      "So for my job I am on call every 3rd weekend. Most of my site are an hour south of me. My lady and our son is about 40 mins south of there I live also. I am on call this weekend and my lady is work today. Our son who is 11 is home by himself and I tried to work out with my job to take my work truck there and spend day with him but couldn't get in touch with my boss yesterday. I just told my lady that I am running to the store and gym which is 10 mins from my house. She told me I was an asshole becuase I doing all this running but can't be there for our son. Tried explain i have a certain time frame to answer a call. If I leave from her house it is 45 mins home then change and an hour to the site. At least 2 hours to get there.  Longer then our time frame. I was able to speak with my boss today and will be there for our son all day tomorrow.\n",

      "Just wanted to use a throwaway account since I'm not sure who uses reddit nowadays.   WIBTA if I (22M) didn't drive my mom (59F) and brother (30M) to the beach?   My family wants us to go on a beach trip for memorial day and it was extremely last minute. I'm talking maybe a week and a half ago at best.  Me and my girlfriend are going to the beach and we were going to drive her car down to the beach as 1) we wanted alone time to ourselves and 2) my mom and brother both smoke heavily. I'm talking a pack of cigarettes a day.   This drive is 2 and a half hours and in case you're asking why I didn't ask them to just not smoke, I've told them how I don't like being around them when they smoke previously and for some reason they still blow smoke in my face, yet wonder why I don't sit around them.   So I informed my mom of this around 3 days ago after finally convincing her to actually go around 5/6 days ago (that was an ordeal in and of itself). She seemed to be pretty fine with it at first, but then brought up an hour or two later saying how she's no longer going because my brother doesn't have his license and for some reason she doesn't want to drive. Not because she can't by the way.  She would also be using my car to drive up there. A 2017 car with everything in order from insurance to registration in the glove box.   She has no actual disability or anything that prevents her from driving if we go based off of her driving to go shopping, pick up my nieces from school, pick up cigarettes, or drive about an hour away to go to the thrift store here and there.   I told her my reasons as stated above, but she said that she won't smoke and she'll get my brother to not smoke as well unless we're at a gas station or we'll take a smoke break randomly.  Both of these statements I don't believe because I've asked them to not smoke in a closed car with me originally but they still did it an continue to do it despite my complaints. It's to the point where my car smells like cigarettes when I first get in it and when I cut the AC on despite the use of air fresheners.  Now she's saying I'm an AH for not driving her, even though she can drive herself and is going to be using my car. My brother is saying I need to apologize because apparently she watched her dad die memorial day weekend, but I wasn't aware of this.   I refuse to apologize as well because she cursed me and my girlfriend out (who stayed out of the entire situation and said it's my family, and I can choose who to drive with) and calling us whores, assholes, bitches, etc., because of this.  I eventually did try to apologize despite all this, but now she's ignoring me and telling me to get out of her house.   So WIBTA?\n",
      "I (19M) live with my dad (53m), brothers (17m & 15m), and my mom (43F). My mom is the most beautiful soul ever. Always there for us. Encouraged us in whatever dream or goal we had.  Two years ago my mom suffered a major stroke. She fought hard to learn to be able to walk and talk again. And we were with her every step of the way. Things were going great until this past year. My mom now has unknown neurological disorders that renders her paralyzed to at times almost a vegetative state. In between those times she’s fine but can’t be left alone. My dad is a truck driver but comes home every weekend and we have a nurse who helps during the day while we’re at school or work.  I was offered a full ride at one of our country’s top universities when I graduated. My family, friends, and my girlfriend was so excited about it. But none as much as my mom. I was excited too. But I just couldn’t do it. I couldn’t leave my mom’s care on just my dad and brothers.  My gf thinks I’m sick because I have zero problem feeding my mom, changing her diaper, bathing her, dressing her, carrying her outside to sit in her chair. (Neither does my dad or brothers). My gf recently told my mom that she was destroying my life and it would be best if she went to a home where others could deal with her.  My mom sat us all down crying and apologized to us for being a burden. Told us she was going to look at homes so we could be free to live our lives. When we finally found out why she was saying this, dad lost it. I called my gf and told her to stay the f*ck away from me and my family. That she was a cold hearted bitch who belongs in hell.  She called me a sick pervert. Now I have people talking about how I’m in a sexual relationship with my mom. I’m still pissed because my mom is hurting and depressed. None of us want her in a home. But if it’s really what mom wants are we being selfish if we don’t put her in one?  Small update: Dad’s taking a couple weeks off. I sent him a link to this so he could read all the comments. Granted ultimately any decisions will be made by him and mom but he wants us all to sit down together and talk.  I do want to let y’all know that I’m still going to school but instead of an Ivy League, I’m going to university of Arkansas.  My middle brother Jake is studying diesel mechanics. And Johnny the youngest has a ways to go before graduating high school and joining the Navy.  Girlfriend is in the ex category.  I’ll let y’all know what happens after dad and mom talk with us.\n",
      "Ok. So I am a guy that is marrying his long term girlfriend on Friday. We are keeping it a really small affair, only family and close friends (about 30 people in total). This includes 2 of my friends who I have known for over 10 years - let’s call them A and B.   A and B both live approximately 2 hours train ride from the location we are getting married. A had told me a couple of weeks ago that he has to leave early to meet a friend the next day. He must have arranged this after we sent the invite as he responded that he would be joining me and my wife at some activities the next day. Today I have found out that B is also leaving early. So, they are both arriving on a train about 45 minutes before the service starts and leaving on a train around 9 o’clock at night. In total spending less than 12 hours in the city. Am I being unreasonable to be a bit upset by this?  For further context B is also getting married later in the year. His wedding will be taking place in France, which will require at least half a day travel from where I live in the UK spread across trains, planes and rental cars. In total it is going to be a 4 day round trip. Genuinely interested in thoughts. I haven’t said anything to A and B, and it is probably too late to do so without just creating tension, but I am annoyed that they think that is OK. I am just wondering if our friendship is worth a lot less to them than I had thought.  EDIT: so I have only just figured out I can edit this. Thought it was locked. So general consensus seems to be AITA (although bless all you kind souls that disagreed). I guess I wrote this when I was a bit pissed. As I have put somewhere below I am a bit anxious about all the logistics of everything/making everyone has a good time etc. It kinda set me off that they are arriving as late as possible and leaving as soon as possible. That is probably the most negative interpretation of their actions.   Soooo... gonna tap out, live my life and look forward to my wedding. Actually been really positive as I probably would have otherwise just stewed on the situation for a bit. So thanks for the comments. Peace out.\n",
      "So I know how it sounds but for context we're both in our teens and he's the oldest. He used to physically and emotionally abuse me because what he had to go through as a kid.         A month ago at my other brother's birthday (who we'll call Michael) my oldest brother (who we'll call John) got there super late then followed me around attempting to instigate a fight then later in the day I was just sitting down eating at the campsite before he randomly threw something at me as hard as he could cutting me then continued chasing me around the campsite throwing what ever he could find at me for no reason.          Now we get to his birthday we go to a waterpark and he drives himself. He was about an hour late and him and his girlfriend were fighting the whole time.         Then we go to an escape room and it's a head to head room I go with my mom, her boyfriend, his daughter who was about five, and my little brother who is eight while John went on the other team with our dad, Michael, and his girlfriend skip forward and we escape with five minutes left and they don't escape at all. Once we were out I was celebrating and I rubbed it in his face a bit and he blew up at me in private saying that he did all the work on his team and everyone else was useless. Then we get to my dad's house that he rarely comes to where the guest room has a brand new memory foam mattress while I had a 20 year old mattress without a boxspring or anything while I live there so we switched out the mattresses the day of his birthday. (because I didn't want him screwing his girlfriend on it since I was going to be sleeping on it for the next year of my life atleast)         He ended up convincing my dad to kick me out of my room so that he could sleep on my bed which resulted on me sleeping on the couch because the guest room was super nasty from him trashing it everytime he came here. Then I wake up and try to get back into my room and the door was locked so I go and sit on the couch until about an hour later I hear the door open. I walked over to my room and saw his girlfriend messing with the cat and me already pissed at this point because I couldn't sleep I barge in there and ask them to get out of my room and it started a fight before I kicked them out of my room and cleaned the sheet.\n",
      "So I've been roommates with a guy friend for the last four years because him and his old roommate had a falling out, so I let him move in with me, in my house I'm renting from my folks. It's not a big house at all, it even has a door way between our rooms, but no door.(Its just the way the house is built)  Any time he had a problem I would do what I could to fix it. It started off with simple request and I didn't mind putting up with it because he pays his side of the bills but, he has gotten worse since I got a boyfriend.   He now eats most of the food I buy, specially the junk food and he doesn't buy any (He ones ate over 85% of a family size lasagna by himself in two days). He has no issues dirting up dishes, but won't wash a single one after they pile up in his room for three weeks. (No joke, in four years of living here, he might have wash them 5 times). He doesn't clean up the house at all because he's tired from work and it's not his problem, that I need to do it.  He has bitch that I need to stop listing to creepy stories or crepy documentaries while I sleep because he can hear it and it bothers him, that maybe I should just sleep with the tv off. He sleeps anywhere between 8 PM to 7 AM and between those times, if I make a sound louder than a whisper, he gets mad.  Now the icing on the cake is that he has made it very well known he doesn't like it when I have sex with my boyfriend and when i mean well known, he has slammed doors as soon as he has gotten home to tell me he is home and to shut up (again, it's a tiny house) he has even texted me ten minutes after the fact, just to tell me we woke him up. (I just got a text tonight from him that reads, \"you wake me up every night\").   He won't shit when my boyfriend is around or awake. He wont say anything to my face, but he sure likes to text me all his issues and complaints. I've bent the knee more times than I can count to make him happy, hell I've even try to change my life style so he would shut up, but this has just finally built up and I can't take it anymore. I love my night owl life style, I love my creepy stories, and I love banging my man loudly! He knew all this about me before he moved in, he has no problem with any of this until my boyfriend is around. I'm just lost for words. I don't think I'm the Ass, but according to him I am one and being extra disrespectful on top of that. So I ask yall, AITA? Or should I tell him to go play jump rope in traffic?\n",
      "First ever post so not really sure how this all works lol  So I'm living with my good friend and his gf in a 2 bedroom apartment and they recently decided to adopt a cat. Not that I have a problem with cats but our lease states we cant have pets here at all.   Originally the cat was only supposed to be here for 2 weeks at most until they could find a different home for him. Now all of a sudden the cat is going to be here for good and I was never included in the conversation about keeping the cat here. So for the safety of possibly getting evicted I told them both that I was going to move out and they both freaked out on me bc I pay for most of the bills here and his gf doesn't pay rent or contribute any way financially.   So AITA for wanting to try and save my own skin before they get caught or should I just bite the bullet and finish out our lease?\n",
      "I'm using a throwaway cause my sister knows my account.   So mom cheated on my dad a few months back and now they are getting a divorce the problem is I don't hate my mom for it but now I'm not sure. I told my sister that I don't hate her for it and she got really mad at me and stopped talking to me for a few days.  It's just hard to hate my own mom because she's been a caring mother my whole life then this thing happened and now I don't know how to feel so reddit AITA?\n",
      "I'm still friends with a girl I dated last year. We still slept together occasionally, but she also was dating another person with whom she sleeps. She got pregnant and claimed it was mine. I did everything in my power to help her through this time ie mental support, drop her off and pick her up from work.   We both knew we're both not in the position to raise children and we both know we're not good together. Which is why I stopped sleeping with her last of November. I also didn't think it was fair to the other person she is dating. So we stopped talking as well. She comes back with the pregnancy news and I tried helping her throughout the whole ordeal. She chose for abortion and I'm still there for some after care if needed.   She asked me to help her clean up some trash in her home. I already said yes but she cancelled it the first time around. Today she asks me again to help her. I ask her what time since I work a 9 to 5 job and she works late shifts. Then without saying yes I asked her how much it was.   She suddenly tells me off again. So I asked her why she's doing this for the second time and suddenly I'm inconsiderate and an asshole. I mean it feels like she's mad because I didn't say yes immediately. I mean I was going to help one way or another, but this feels like guilt tripping to me.\n",
      "Background: I'm a 16 y/o female with asthma who's openly recovering from EDs. I'm currently 86.4 Lbs. My sister (17) and I are on a team which requires running. The season doesn't open until October. She and I go on jogs together on alternating days of the week. I love running, and would happily go with her if she wasn't an ass about it. Unfortunately, she's a dick about it and will not accommodate me or go without me. She keeps forcing me to run faster even though I can't, and insists I go with her no matter whether or not it's convenient for me. She will push me in the final 100 meters just so she can complete the run first.  I've tried not going and she either guilt trips me onto going or forces me to go by telling on me. Today was the last fucking straw for me. Today, I went on a two hour hike, did a workout and my online classes, which were followed by a nap. She woke me up by playing a speaker in my ear at the loudest setting, with a Frozen 2 video screaming, \"WAKE UPPPPPPP!\"  Obviously I was pissed and asked her what the fuck that was about. She said, \"Its time to go running!\" I voiced my displeasure at her rude awakening (literally), and ripped her a new one with how she was treating me. How if she wanted to go running with me (Im not slow, believe me), she'd have to go at a reasonable pace, let me use my inhaler, and warn me when we were going as she just went whenever she'd like. She got pissed and said, \"I just won't go then. Whatever. If we lose, just remember you didn't want to suck it up and stop being a baby.\"  Downstairs, I heard her telling my dad we won't be going today, and at the end of it say, \"There's a reason why she's fat and I'm not.\" She fully knows about my EDs and asthma, and refused to apologize. I went on that run because I felt so guilty. AITA and being unreasonable? I've already tried negotiating and just letting her go on her own.\n",
      "So my brother has been in and out of juvi, prison, etc since he was 16. (He is now 30) Last November he got released after doing 6 years in prison for home invasion robberies. He has been doing pretty good for himself for the last 7 months so i was really proud of him. But then he just got a public intox drinking sending him to spend the night in jail (he’s still on parole for another year so he has an ankle bracelet on from this incident). He has a girlfriend who he has been with for less than 4 months. She has two kids which she doesn’t currently have in her custody or take care of. They just got engaged which seemed super quick but whatever that’s their decision. But now he tells me they are pregnant and expecting a child. He told me they were actively trying for this so it wasn’t an accident. Honestly it just upset me when he told me because I’m worried about the future child’s well-being. My family has always taken care of him(went and visited him all the time, sent money to him all these years) my worry is that if something were to happen to him like getting locked up again, my family would definitely be the ones responsible for the child. Am I the asshole for not being happy for him?\n",
      "My gf got elected to be some type of leadership role in a club in college. I told her congrats. In the middle of a conversation I said “how did you even get that, you barely went to the events.” She got super pissed and treated her like she put in no work into it. I frankly don’t know whether she went to the events or not. Last time she told me she was ditching one so I based it off that. I didn’t mean it offensively but I thought it was super competitive to get it and thought she didn’t go to them.   She said I undermine her and think she’s not capable. Little did I know, she actually did attend a lot of events and put in a lot of time toward this club. She even got an award for high attendance and I just didn’t know. I admit it was a kinda rude thing to say but I meant no harm and I was genuinely curious.   She got extremely pissed off, made a huge deal about it. We fought all night and almost broke up. I kept apologizing but she didn’t take it and I was getting frustrated and started to ignore her at one point. I made a joke it the past (3 months ago) about how she got some Cs in her classes and I got all As and she connects both situations and thinks I think she’s a dumbass. Which I don’t.   Am I the asshole?\n",
      "So basically my sister was informed by a guy that he likes her best friend and was told to keep a secret. She immediately told her and a few other friends in the room.  (Keep in mind that this guy is already not great mentally and has been to a therapy resort)  So the best friend confirms that she does not share the same feelings for the guy. And my sister told him to sing a song in front of her and a bunch of other people at a party. I already felt the second hand depression and embarrassment because we know that he’s going to get rejected. But my sister insisted that this person has a chance with the best friend and his hyping him up. She said that she’s doing this to “have fun” and get a kick out of the situation.   The next day I was overhearing a conversation with the dude and my sister on speaker phone and the best friend was next to her pretending to not be there. I couldn’t stand by witnessing knowing how fucked up the situation is and having witnessed my own brother pass away in front of me in the hospital for excessive drinking because his wife left him. So I feel a lot of empathy for this guy even tho I don’t know him at all.  So what I did was I logged into T-Mobile, got the dudes phone number from my sister’s call usage line, and texted him from a fake number warning him. He didn’t believe me at first and ended up notifying my sister and then she notified the best friend. And my sister pretty much figured out it was me cause she knows that I can be clever like this. She also said that I’m apparently ruining all of her fun. Am I the asshole for doing that even tho it was none of my business to do so?\n",
      "Hello everyone. I just took a trip with my family to a couple different countries. I wanted to make sure my family had a good time so we booked a bunch of different activities during this trip. One of these activities was a dolphin encounter. I thought it would be fun for the kids to get up close with a dolphin. So we book the event and go about our trip. Once the event comes up and I see the dolphins swimming around under the dock I remember reading about how elephant interactions should be avoided because of the abuse they endure and immediately regretted doing this. We already paid, the kids already saw the dolphins and really wanted to be close to them so we went through the event.  TLDR - Paid to swim with captive dolphins.  Am I the Asshole for doing this? NTA (so far)\n",
      "I really don't know if I would be wrong here so help me out, strangers.  My (36F) dad has a collection of model trains from his childhood (the electric kind, you build the tracks, there's intersections with bars and lights, there's bridges, stations, etc.). He first showed them to me and my sister (39F) when we were 5 and 8. We spent days building the tracks around the Christmas tree and I'd wake up early every day to play with the trains. My sister was more indifferent. Around new years, the trains went in a large chest and into the basement.   Every Christmas since then, I'd ask my dad to help me set up the tracks so we can have the trains again run around the Christmas tree. Some years we didn't do this because we'd be traveling but for me it was part of our Christmas tradition. My sister never cared. Eventually, I moved out of my parents house to study. When I'd visit them for the Christmas holidays, they'd say it's too much trouble to set up the trains for the few days I'd be spending. By that point, I said that once I had my forever home, I'd take the trains with me so they'd always be set up in time for the holidays. I guess nobody disagreed and they even moved the chest into my old bedroom.  Fast forward to some time ago. I am still not in my forever home (postgraduate studies, temporary employment abroad, ...). My sister has moved to another city (4 hours by plane, 24 by car) and has two sons. She and the kids are visiting my parents for Christmas and my dad brings out the trains, has them repaired, and sets them up for the boys. The older one is not impressed. The younger plays a little with them but ultimately he does what his older brother does. My dad is somewhat disappointed because \"none of the boys wants to get his childhood trains\". I remind him that  I want them  once I have a more permanent living situation.  Which brings us to now. I am in my forever home (also a 24 hr drive from my parents' and 8 from my sister's) and I have a 9 mo son. He's too young to play with the trains but I still dream of a Christmas gathering in our living room with the trains running around the tree (the cat would probably disagree but that's not the point). In all casual discussions with my parents where the trains are brought up, they say that my nephews should get them because they are old enough to play with them (6 and 8). My sister (and, as far as I know, her kids) have never asked to get the trains.   Would I be the a-hole to ask that we get them even if we don't know if my son would ever care to play with them?  Notes:  1: we cannot easily split the contents of the chest - there are some pieces that are very rare (/expensive to buy new).   2: of course it's ultimately up to my dad to decide who gets them, but seeing how difficult they are to transport, I fear that if my sister gets them and then realizes she doesn't want them, they would likely end up in her basement.  3: my parents are planning to move out and downsize so I suspect a decision regarding the fate of the trains is imminent.\n",
      "I was supposed to come in today at 12. I’ve been working there since 8 in the morning because he wanted some stuff to be done before the store opened. That is fine. The boss was also supposed to come in a 12. He never showed. This is a place where it functions smoothly only with at least 2 people. I was supposed to leave at 4 because I came in early and the boss knows that. I left at 5 but I feel very guilty for leaving only 1 guy there. It’s not like I’m doing anything productive after but I still feel very guilty.\n",
      "First off, I know what most commenters will say if I don't address this. Yes, I know how to take a joke, but this time I think he crossed the line.  Background info: We're both in highschool and we've been best-freinds for about five years now. If you were to compare our outside characteristics with cartoon characters, we would match Mordecai and Rigby (him being Mordecai and me being rigby) and this means he gets more attention from people for being Superior to me. I don't mind this much, but this detail is an important part of the story. During lunch, we sit with three girls and another friend of ours. One of the girls we sit with has a thing for my best friend and vice-versa. I knew of this beforehand. (I was the only one who knew)  Friend I called a dickhead: C Girl that has a thing for C: G Me: me  On with the story. We were at lunch, having a good time as usual. G and C start flirting, then C cracks a joke. I laugh like any person would. G laughs too, but when she's done, she starts laughing again. I asked her why, and she says \"you make the funniest laughing face ever\". C brutally elaborates by saying \"Yeah you look fucking retarded when you laugh\", but I brushed it off by saying \"Damn it really be like that sometimes\". This caught me off guard and not gonna lie, it kind of made me mad.  This is the embarrassing part. I have an underbite and a pretty large tongue, so I'm bound to spit sometimes when I talk. I don't spit that much when I talk, but C likes to point this out Everytime it happens. Me, G and C were having a conversation, and when I spoke to C, I accidentally spit on his thigh. It wasn't even that much either. I'd say a drop smaller than an ant landed on him. C raises his voice at me and tells me that I accidentally spit on him. I tell him I can't control it, but he proceeds to tell the whole group I spat on him. This is when I call him a dickhead.  When I call him a dickhead, he gets very offended and says \"bro what I didn't even do anything to you\" and I proceeded to tell him everything he's done to me the past week. (Yes, he's done a lot more to me than raising his voice at me.) After I gave him a list of times he was an ass to me, he tells me that I need to learn to take a joke. G tells me than I need to take a joke too, but I'm guessing they failed to realize that all they did to me for the last week was gang up on me and insult me every chance they get. I stay silent for the rest of lunch.  I love C, but he can get out of control with his \"jokes\". I consulted with our other friends about C's antics, and they all agree with me, but I still feel bad for calling C a dickhead. I may be too emotional, but I'm not sure. What I'm sure of is that I know people see me as inferior to him, which just made it hurt even more. I know that C was just trying to impress G, but he could've done it differently.   So AITA?\n",
      "So this all sounds really inconsequential typing it out but it’s become a huge deal somehow and I can’t work out if I’m in the right.   I live communally, so we all have a separate bed sit on farmland in old outbuildings that have been ‘done up’, but I share a bathroom, freezer and washing machine with 2x 50-60 year old men. For reference I’m a 22 year old female and this is important for reasons I’ll explain.   The stuff we share is on a meter, and every quarter our landlady divides it up and splits it equally among us.   A few times since I’ve been living here, like today, I’ve had my period and bled into my bed sheets at night. Because of this, I’ve put them on to wash in the morning outside of ‘cheap rates’. (Cheap rates are 12pm-2pm and 9pm-5am) When one of my neighbours sees this they go crazy and leave angry notes about how I’m ‘driving up the bill’.  The way I see it, I pay an equal share to use the washing machine and I shouldn’t have to justify to anybody else why I’m washing my blood stained sheets outside of ‘economy time’ because I don’t want the blood to stain.   The way they see it, I’ve moved in and driven up their bill. I know they won’t understand the bedsheets thing because they are guys and neither have any women in their lives, and I’m too embarrassed to explain it. AITA?\n",
      "I have two close friends, Jane and Sarah. I have been friends with Jane since elementary school and Sarah since high school. We are all now almost seniors in college and jokingly wanted to get matching/similar tattoos together.   We’ve been talking about this for a few years. It started out as a joke but then we decided it would be funny and to do it.   The three of us set the date, this past Monday. We were booked in for like 3 and a half months because the woman we went to had a backlog of catching up on Covid tattoos. No worries, we absolutely love her work.   The day before comes and Sarah backs out. She said she had something to do and asked if we could push it. There’s a cancelation fee, and Jane and I were all set for it. Then Sarah says nothing came up and she’s actually nervous and doesn’t want to get one. Jane and I said “Okay. But we still want to get one.” And that was the end of the conversation, Sarah never replied back in the group chat.  Next day, we go get our small frog tattoos. We were so pumped, we posted them on Instagram and tagged the studio/artist in it and we were thrilled!  Sarah then texted us saying we were rude for not waiting for her and for not considering her in this decision since we were ALL supposed to get frog tattoos. And she commented (and then deleted like an hour later) “Didn’t wait for me tho… ” with the swirl mouth sick emoji.   Now she’s completely ignoring us. We tried reaching out and the only other response we got was that “That’s not what friends do. You could have waited.”  Jane and I feel like assholes because we got them without her, and didn’t try to talk to her more about it and just taking her “I’m nervous, I don’t want to” as a response. Should we have tried to talk about it more? We’re we assholes?\n",
      "To set the scene, I (f/28) currently live in an area very near a wildfire with my parents. My Mom (f/60s) had to leave for a couple of days, so it was just me, my Dad (m/70s), and the dog. (He's socially anxious, but a good boy!)   It was that morning when we were notified that our area was officially in the \"Set\" stage of evacuation. My Dad and I went over what we should do if we did have to leave quickly, and he told me that he'd done some research. Apparently we are not legally required to leave our property, and he said (he told me this a couple days before, too) that he wants to stay and defend the property. There is a good perimeter around the place, (the fire probably wouldn't get too close), and he said that he has the water hose to put out any stray sparks.   This  may  have been okay while my Mom was here, as then we would have had two vehicles, one for us to evacuate in, one to leave with my Dad. But with only one vehicle, I would have to leave him without any means of transportation. I did not want to do that.   I said that he had a choice to make about his priorities—his family, or the property. I told him that him staying would worry both my Mom and I very much, and that we can rebuild if the property burns, but that once he's gone, that's it. He didn't say much.  Later that day, I was talking with my Grandma (f/80s) to update her, and told her about the conversation with my Dad. He happened to walk by then, and said 'hi' to her. One of the first things she said to him was, \"You had better go (if you have to evacuate)!\"   My Dad then replied in a very 'I don't wanna...... but I have to.... :/ :( :/' voice, saying, \"I already told her I would go...\"  &#x200B;  So, AITA for telling my Grandma about the situation? I didn't have to give her the details of the conversation, and I feel like I kind of got my Dad 'in trouble', or made the situation worse/more tense. Also, AITA for telling him that he had to make a choice between our family and the property? The whole situation is making me feel uncomfortable and unsure of if what I said was reasonable.\n",
      "so I have twins 15 year old boy and girl.  lena and Logan   so lena has some issues with her legs and has to use a leg brace meaning I spend more on shoes as the leg braces can be kinda annoying and I've found that expensive shoes work the best. I'm talking about 2/300$ for shoes.   now Logan does not get the expensive shoes as he does not need them, I normally spend between 100/150$  its caused an issue between them and he thinks that I value him less, I explained that because of her disability she needs better shoes. he is now refusing to wear any shoes and is very angry at me. he still feels that I dont like him as much.

      "This happened a few days ago and wanted to see if I was in the right. I (16M) was wearing my Yara buff from Survivor Winners at war, my family and I were getting dinner, my brother (25M) didn’t have a mask even tho everyone else did. He asked if he could use my buff as a mask, I said no mainly because I didn’t want it to get dirty and if it got ruined I couldn’t reasonably replace it. He said I am selfish and that he was paranoid about getting Covid. Luckily the restaurant had a mask he could wear. So Reddit AITA?\n",
      "I (17f) have a half sister (15f). My parents divorced and my mom remarried and had my sister.  I split my time between my parents. It's easy because we live in the same city. As my father is now wealthy, we do nice things frequently. Such as international holidays every year.   My father remarried when I was 5 years old. My stepmom is the sweetest lady and when dad and I plan holidays she naturally comes with us. My good relationship with my stepmom has always annoyed my bio mom.   After a weekend with my dad, I had to go back to my mom. I just got my license, so I insisted on driving myself. Stepmom lent me one of her Range Rovers.   Pull into the driveway and my sister runs out and asks to drive it. I say no, because she doesn't have a license and I don't know how my stepmom would feel if I let my family members drive it. She says that she has her learners permit and if I'm in the car with her it'll be fine. I still say no.   Bio mom says I shouldn't have such an expensive car. She goes on about how she used to be the one that supported my dad because he made so little during their marriage.  I unpack and come downstairs. My mom now wants to talk about how I'm 'mean' to my sister and I should share things that I own. Apparently she started crying because I wouldn't let her drive 'my' car. I say it's not mine, and that I can get dad and stepmom to come down and pick it up. Mom gets furious when she realises I drove stepmom's car home. Accuses me of showing off dad's wealth since she couldn't afford to give my sister such nice things.   Two days later, I notice my sister wearing a necklace. My. heart. drops.   It was a necklace from tiffany's that my stepmom had gotten me for my 9th birthday with our names engraved on it. I still love it and refuse to go anywhere without it. Because of what bio mom feels about stepmom I don't wear it while I stay with her but it's still in my jewelry box. I usually don't say anything when my sister comes into my room and takes my stuff  - but this was the one piece that was off limits and she knows it.  I tell her to take it off and she refuses. Since she can't drive the car, may as well let her wear the necklace. I tell her she can take literally anything from my room except this. Her reply? \"But it's from Tiffany's. It's expensive so I want to wear it.\"  We fight, and she still refuses to hand it back and hints that she'll keep it for herself since I can get a new one. I blow up at her. I tell her not so politely to hand the necklace back and that my things are not hers. That she's able to use my stuff because I don't mind, not because she is entitled to it.   She gives back the necklace and runs off crying. Mom comes to my room later and accuses me of being selfish and that my sister does have a right to use my things and I'm being a spoiled brat by not letting her use them. That I shouldn't have yelled at my little sister over a necklace.\n",
      "My wife has been sleeping in our 4yo daughter’s room while the other bedroom is remodeled, and she has a tray she stores all her meds in.  Ranging from Aleve and birth control pills to powerful antidepressants and anxiety medication.  About 15 different medications in all.  She’s always been careless with her pills, I frequently will find loose ones on the ground or in laundry hampers.  Not to mention laying in the tray she stores the medicine bottles in.  The problem is she keeps it on top of a dresser in my daughter’s room, and my daughter can easily reach it.  Compounded with the fact that every morning and night she takes all of these pills in front of our daughter, and the little one is really into imitating us and doing the same things we do, and I’m really uncomfortable with all these drugs being stored the way they are.  Childproof bottles or not.  I’ve asked her before to move them to the upper shelf in the bathroom linen closet and she said she would, but hasn’t done it.  It had been several weeks, and last night I calmly told her that either she needed to move her meds that night or that I would do it for her.  Didn’t yell or call her names, didn’t swear or anything confrontational.  Her response was a bunch of gibberish about how I shouldn’t be calling her a bad mom and that the pills are fine where they are because our daughter has never tried to play with them before.  I repeated my offer to move them for her if she didn’t want to do it and she said she would do it, then didn’t talk to me the rest of the night.  Well this morning I go upstairs to get my daughter dressed and see the goddamn pills still in the bedroom.  So I moved them to the bathroom closet.  She’s gonna be pissed when she gets home and I don’t care.  AITA for insisting she move her pills away from the reach of our 4yo?\n",
      "So my dad (50) and I (20F) have a very strained relationship, we only recently started talking again after I went NC over the summer after he screamed at me on the phone because I asked him to stop leaving my sisters (10,7,5) home alone and then told everyone in our family I needed to apologize to HIM for hanging up on him.  I only started talking to him again because I was scared he was gonna start not letting my sisters see me. He’s used them against me before so I wouldn’t put it past him  He called me one day and told me he was marrying his girlfriend, who I’ve only met once by surprise because he just drove me to her house one day in August. So I don’t really know her enough to have an opinion. They haven’t been together long though, that’s all I know. I don’t feel one way or another on the marriage to be honest.  Now why do I don’t want to go? My dad is really emotionally draining to deal with, and on top of that I can already see that I’m going to have to parent my sisters the whole time since that’s what has happened my sisters entire lives. I love my sisters to death don’t get me wrong but there’s three of them and other than me, no one else tries to get them to behave or get dressed. I really don’t want to have to deal with the stress of getting three extra people dressed and do their hair (which is always matted and broke off and the two youngest ones scream the whole time) and also attend an event where I’m going to have to watch them while worrying about my dad possibly yelling at me for doing something wrong.   I’ve talked to my mom about it and she says if I don’t want to go I don’t have to since I’m an adult, but I’m worried that me not being there would cause alot of drama in the family and since my grandfather passed last year I’m pretty sure no one would back me up on my decision, except possibly my older brother (33) but that’s a big maybe since he sides with my aunt in alot of things, since they’re more like siblings.  &#x200B;  So WIBTA?\n",
      "My daughter (14F) likes to keep her hair short. So yesterday she asked me if she could go to the mall (around 15 mins from our place) to get her hair cut. I told her she couldn't go alone and she would have to wait until I was done with my work, and my niece (20F) (who is staying with us for a week because her parents are out and I'm apparently everyone's favorite uncle) overheard and said she could take her, because she needed new shoes and was planning to go anyway. At that point my son (17M) came out and asked me if he could go, and invite a friend (who lives near us). My daughter now also wanted to invite her best friend (who also lives near us), and I said sure, if my niece was okay with it. My niece said she was but she'd invite her girlfriend just in case. So they had a nice long outing, and I was fine with it.  When my wife came home and didn't see the kids there, she flipped out and started yelling at me, telling me that I was an irresponsible parent and I shouldn't have let the kids out on their own. I tried to explain to her that there were two adults and two 17 year old boys with my daughter, but she wouldn't listen. Eventually I ended up having to drive to the mall to pick them up.  AITA?\n",
      "So a bit of back story. I've been working at a gas station for close to a year now, I think since around the beginning of June. Originally started working about 28 hours a week at 8.75 an hour (minimum wage in my state) earning me around 240 per week at best. Starting August, my work schedule tanked, because I started going to college which was required to be in person from 8am-5pm, meaning I could only work weekends for 8 hours a day, meaning only 16 hours at best, and let me tell you, going from around 240 to 140 a week is not fun at all, and I've pretty much come to hate working there because the management are all assholes.  Fast forward to beginning of the year. New semester started and my schedule changed, half a day Monday morning and all of Friday off. I really liked this set up so I could use Friday to myself. Fearing I'd lose that half a day and day off, I never told my boss about that.  Fast Forward again to I think the 11th. I had made plans with my friends to hang out on Sunday the 25th, so I requested it off, and in exchange I came up with some bullshit saying some classes are ending, and starting the 26th I can start working Monday afternoons, and all day Friday, she accepted my day off and made a note I assume to herself saying I could work those days.  Fast forward once again to a few days ago, after school I was working on my car and went to hang out with friend for a bit. We stopped off at my job to get some food and drinks, and I figured I'd check my schedule, only to find out, I'm only working on Saturday the 24th, and only 8 hours this week, leaving me with 70 bucks that paycheck without taxes.  Fast forward one final time, this time to Wednesday night. I got a text asking if I could come in Friday night, and she had no one else to ask. I had previously made plans for my friends to come over and help with my car, because I couldn't take care of it myself. I said sure, not realizing what day she meant, maybe half an hour went by and I realized she meant this Friday, tomorrow. I tried explaining to her that I couldn't come in because I have plans, but she wasn't having it. Spent all morning trying to think of a way to say \"Hey I'm sorry but I can't come in and you can't do anything about it\" in a respectful way. In the end I pretty much said that and she ended up saying \"Well then you'll be written up\"  TL;DR Somewhat useless background then, boss said \"hey get your ass in here I need you\" and I said \"go fuck yourself\"\n",
      "Weird one, but here goes-  Edit- Thought the past tense made it clear, but this is from a year ago.  I no longer work there, I quit after overhearing the disliked asst. manager talking crap about me.  I was working at a popular coffee/doughnut chain and the environment there was just.. not great.  This was middle of the pandemic, and my normal line of work (overseas English teacher) had been interrupted- I think it’s somewhat relevant to mention that I’m college educated while the rest of the staff were either teens or came from more blue collar backgrounds.  Doesn’t make anyone better or worse obviously, just giving insight on background.  Anyways, I’m also half-Jewish.  I don’t practice or anything, but I’m also proud of my heritage and all that.  My one assistant manager and I butted heads, and she (I think) straight up used the N word on at least one occasion I can remember.  I had no record of it and she’d just deny it, so I never brought it up with corporate.  I got along with the other assistant though, and the two of them were cousins, if memory serves.  Related in some way, they lived together.  Anyways, the assistant manager I got along with got frustrated at a coffee lid that wouldn’t fit on a cup one day and unthinkingly muttered “come on you stupid Jew” or something along those lines.  He knew about me being half-Jewish.  He paused a moment, looked up awkwardly, and muttered “sorry.”  I was so taken aback by the weirdness of the comment that I didn’t know what to say.  I think I just stayed silent and let the moment pass- the dude was usually a nice guy, but somewhere along the line he somehow picked up the habit of calling a frustrating thing “a Jew”, I guess.  Anyways, it was a busy shift, we all just got back to work, but I’m wondering how others would have handled the situation.  Should I have talked to him about it later?  I wasn’t personally that offended, it was an offhand stupid comment, but I wonder if I should have made him more aware of why that’s a rather messed up thing to say.  As to the other asst. manager using the N word- she said it within the vicinity of a black co-worker.  I wasn’t completely sure I’d heard her right at first, but it’d be the only word that would make sense contextually (black person coming through drive-thru and the asst. manager said “I need this N out of my line” or something).  If my coworker had heard it and got offended I’d have supported her 100%, but since she didn’t say anything I didn’t feel it was my place to call the asst. manager out.  Really wasn’t sure I’d heard her right as well, but from what I knew of this person it’d kinda fit.  There were a lot of unfortunate stances/utterances in this store, those are just the two that stand out most.  Anyways, AITA for not doing more in these situations?  Corporate wouldn’t have done anything without a record anyways, but I’m wondering if I shoulda made more outta both situations.\n",
      "So this is a relatively minor AITA but it's been an argument between me and my wife for nearly a decade and we're hoping reddit can settle it. I was taught, growing up, that if you are eating with a group of people, you wait until EVERYONE has their food before you begin to eat and that is always what I have done. My wife, on the other hand beings to eat as soon as she is served her food even if other people are still waiting for food. So, in a situation where my wife and I have been served, and no one else has, she starts eating and I don't. She claims this makes me an asshole and I claim it makes her an asshole. Her logic is that once someone starts eating, to continue to NOT eat is just trying to make yourself seem to have superior manners. I say the rule is you don't eat until everyone is served, regardless of who else starts eating. What do you think reddit?\n",
      "I saw this lady at the mall sitting on a bench in front of me and you could see her ass and thong showing quite visibly so i go up to her and I quietly tell her that. She turns around face red and starts screaming at me about how that is \"harassment\" and i shouldn't be looking at her down there. She pulls up her pants and walks away saying I'm an asshole.   Im really confused as I think i did a nice thing\n",
      "My baby father and I have an on again/off again relationship. The last 6 months we haven’t lived together. He’s living at his moms house again and would have visits with our two babies there two times a week for 2 hours each day while I go to a meeting in his hometown. He doesn’t have a car so drop offs and pick ups were on me. Last week his mom was upset that our kids were at her house so I found alternative child care for my meeting. I also told him I would find alternate childcare for my meeting on Christmas Eve. Now his mom wants to us to come over and celebrate Christmas and im Really not interested. I think my ex should be upset that his kids aren’t welcomed at his house (he has another son from a previous relationship and he is welcomed there all the time). Am I wrong for not wanting to go?\n",
      "My best friend and I have always been making Instagram posts to wish each other happy birthday for the last four years. It’s cheesy I know because we would always meet each other anyway that day or give each other a call if we’re apart. My birthday was two months ago and she made one such Instagram post.   I’ve been thinking it’s super cringe lately and only make these happy birthday posts if I see the birthday person that day and just post pictures from our meetup while wishing them happy birthday again in the caption. My best friend has been a few thousand miles away for three months now and her birthday was yesterday, so I didn’t wish her happy birthday on Instagram. I gave her a call and we chatted for a bit.   Just now, she texted me this: “Just because you’re Instagram famous now, you think you’re too cool for me?” I just broke 20K followers recently while my friend only has 800 something. But she’s not on there much anyways. I didn’t know what she meant at first so I texted her “huh?” She then texted “You wished [my other friend] happy birthday two weeks ago on Instagram, why not me? Are we not besties anymore?”   I finally realized that she meant and texted “I just find it kind of cringy now to make these posts and use old photos. If I saw you in person and took a photo, I would have made a post.” She texted “I see.” I replied “yeah, hope you had a good one.” Then we traded emojis. Should I have warned her beforehand that I wouldn’t make a happy birthday post for her? Because that would have probably not hurt her feelings as much.\n",
      "So a few months ago my friends 19 year old Siamese mix cat past away. She was really upset about it and have been looking for a new cat recently. Few days ago she brought home a kitten that she got from a breeder. It was a rag doll, Siamese and something else mix. Now truth be told I been wanting a cat for a long time to. My family also wanted a cat for many reasons. But because of my insane allergies we never could get a regular kitten. Today in my local area I saw a pure bred hypoallergenic kitten for sale. It was the runt and last one of the litter so it was actually pretty cheap. I decided to get her and welcome her home. Everything was great until my friend found out. She was at first subtle about it saying how this kitten looked exactly like her old one. And to be fair it did. But then she talked about trading me the kitten she had for mine. I refused saying that I can’t exactly have just any kitten since I was allergic and I needed a hypoallergenic one this way combined with medicine my body can slowly adjust. She absolutely lost it. She was pissed. She wrote about me on Weibo telling her friends how I was rubbing my new kitten in her face and basically throwing a tantrum. It got so bad that her mother actually called my mom asking for the kitten. My mom refused her obviously but it has gotten really bad… so I don’t know. I mean this kitten does look like her old one. Am I in the wrong here? Forgive my grammar please.  ( UPDATE! Thankyou all for letting me know your opinions down below. I haven’t replied to anyone but I have upvoted a lot. I actually followed many peoples recommendation and decided to block the friend or rather I should call her ex friend.. she is still upset with me. My family agrees on your advice as well. As for the people concerning my allergies. Yes I know cats aren’t fully hypoallergenic. They just produce less FED1L proteins which is what causes the allergic reaction. If you seen my other post you will know I’m actually a dog breeder. And originally I actually am very allergic to dogs as well but with time my body has gotten better. As long as I was my skin after my dogs lick me, I am okay.  my body slowly adjusted. Currently I’m on allergy medication for the cat and my body is actually taking it pretty well. Nothing has swollen yet and my throat eyes and nose feel fine unlike my first attempt with a regular cat. So thank you kindly for all the advice. You guys are truly amazing. )\n",
      "So a bit of backstory: two kids 1 and 4, I’m a sahm kind of. He works, sometimes less than 40 hours a week occasionally more than 40 hours.  Since having our 4 year old I’ve done odd jobs to help pay the bills and necessities, since having our 1 year old it’s gotten harder to have off jobs with 2 kids tagging along. Last time I helped with the bills was 2 months ago. But we’ve used our savings since then. Savings I helped create with my money.   So on to the am I the asshole question:  Me and my husband get into massive fights over me asking him to help with the kids or cleaning the house on his days off.  Super basic things like playing with the kids, giving them there bath, helping entertain them. Basic cleaning stuff like helping with laundry or doing the dishes after a meal, or changing the blanket on the coach etc.  he lays on the couch watching tv/playing video games/ playing on his phone the entire time he is home unless we leave the house to do something or we are eating dinner.  He watches me do everything and doesn’t lift a finger to help.  If I ask for help it’s major toxic fights.   I just need to know AITA ?\n",
      "Hi Reddit, I’m not sure who is the wrong or the right in this situation. I want to trust my instincts, but I also don’t want to overdo it. I’m 16F, and my Dad, 42M, left when I was born. My mom, 46F, has always told me stories about my dad.  She told me that a few months after they were dating, he moved into her house with her via her offer. My mom was and still is very well off financially, she works in a modeling job and makes enough money to live more than comfortably.   Well, according to my mom, he knew this, and took advantage of her. He quit his job, (he worked as a janitor in the Air Force at the time) and took care of the house while she was gone at her modeling job.   When they decided to have me, my mom said that he became extremely nervous when she told him that her water was breaking and needed to go to the hospital ASAP. He drove her to the hospital, and left.  I mainly spend my days with a caretaker who has taken the role of my dad. He takes very good care of me and I can genuinely tell that for once in my life I have someone who cares about me.   Well, he’s back. After 16 years. He’s approached me numerous times in numerous different places. The first being my house. He tried to get my mom to take him back, but she declined. He tried to start conversations with me, but I ignored him. He kept on repeating how sorry he was, and trying to slouch the blame onto me for not forgiving him. The next time he’d approach me would be at my school, in which he picked me up early from the front office and took me to get ice cream with him. I didn’t want to be there, but I heard and acknowledged his plea yet did not forgive him.   However, a few days later at school, I injured my leg playing soccer. My “dad” picked me up from school, and took me to his apartment without telling my mom or my caregiver. He told me I was in a fragile state and It was best I’d stay in one place until I recovered. He sat me in his bathroom and bandaged my leg and gave me an ice pack as well. I started to become very anxious. I was left alone in the bathroom of an apartment of a man who claims to be my dad, without the ability to move. My mind went down several dark routes, and I knew I had to escape. He had closed the door to the bathroom And told me if I needed anything to just holler and he’d bring it. I spent that day in his bathroom, until my caregiver consulted who the school had let pick me up and was furious about it. My caregiver came to pick me up, and scolded my dad as I cried helplessly in my caregivers arms.   My dad kept saying the whole time that I was “ungrateful“ for everything he had done for me, and should start showing my appreciation if I didn’t want even more people to walk out my life.   Im not sure what to believe, and those words stuck with me. I don’t want more people to leave me, and especially not my caregiver. Sometimes I wonder if I’m too stuck in the past, and if it’d be easier to just forgive him and move on with my life. Am AITA?\n",
      "So my friend Matt borrowed $300 from me last year when we went on vacation with out other friends because he miscalculated his budget and got short by a few hundred dollars. I lent him the money and he said he would pay me when we get back from the vacation. However, when we did get back he said that money was a bit tight and asked if he could pay later. I told him no problem, pay me when you can.  It's been six months since then and Matt hasn't paid me or even mentioned the money he owes. I tried mentioning it in individual chats I've had with him to remind him in case he forgot (\"I'm gonna buy that X when you pay me back\" or \"We can eat at X restaurant when you pay me back\"). He just replied things like \"Lol\" or \"Yeah\" but didn't say anything else about the money. I didn't push further because I did say 'pay me when you can'.  However, Matt often sends pictures of things he spent on or things he's planning to buy to our group chat with our other friends. In the past he sent a picture of two higher end french presses and said that he and his girlfriend just got themselves coffee presses and now have 'proper' coffee in the morning. It's about $40 for both and though I think he should have put that money towards paying me instead of buying higher end coffee presses, I didn't say anything since it's just $40 and some people do need their coffee. Another time he said he said he just bought a new IQOS, and it annoyed me because those things cost $100 and that's a third of the amount that he owes me.   Last week he sent a picture of a watch that he wanted to buy (which costs $250) in our group chat and I replied \"Pay me first before buying that :))\" in a half truth, half joke kind of way. Matt called me sounding upset and said that he would appreciate it if next time I don't talk about the money he owes me when others can see since it's between the two of us. He said that he will just buy the watch first since it's a bargain and a lot of other people are interested, but he will pay me by December.  AITA?\n",
      "For background, we have a 1.5 year old baby together. When he was born we agreed that I would find a job that I could work part time from home for and he would work some extra hours. This was fine, but I'm finding that it's too stressful to have to try and do work while also caring for the baby. Right now my husband works 9-10 hour days.  Recently, I asked him if he would consider working more so I could drop the part time job and focus entirely on being a mother. He said that if he did that I would have to do all the chores, so that when he got home he could relax. He would continue to care for the baby some when he got home though, at least he claims. So I said it wasn't fair because I'm already working all day with the baby, and shouldn't have to do all the chores. He wouldn't budge, either he keeps the same hours or I do all the chores.  AITA?  Edit: let me just say y’all clearly don’t have any experience being a stay at home mom. It’s so emotionally draining being on the clock at all times. He gets a break when he gets home, I work all week!\n",
      "So, last night, I (26M) got into an argument about religious spiritual beliefs with my fiance (37M) about religion and spirituality (I identify as a spiritualist, he is an atheist Jew). I believe in spirits and demons, but not in the context that most people think.  Throughout the conversation, as I was stating my beliefs, he kept interrupting with \"I don't believe in that\" and \"there is zero evidence to believe that\" after - Every. Little. Thing. I. Said. I felt monumentally disrespected and said so to him.   He stormed upstairs yelling at me \"I was just stating my beliefs, I'm sorry you hate my beliefs, I won't talk about them anymore.\" I was so mad at him, I called him an asshole and I stayed downstairs for the night.  AITA?\n",
      "I [25F] am getting married in October.  We already sent out the RSVPs and have gotten most of them back, as they are due in about a week.  However, a lot of people have added names to their RSVPs who were not invited.  People will add their SO of a few months who I have never met or even their children who I’ve never met.  I feel as though if they had asked in advance, I might have been more polite about it but people are just sending back their RSVPs that were ONLY addressed to THEM with other names on them.  People are also messaging me saying they don’t understand why they can’t have a plus one, and what kind of wedding is this where I can’t have a plus one? Well, I’ll tell you what kind of wedding it is; the kind that I don’t want to pay $60+ for a random person to be at! But, this is MY wedding day! Are you coming to my wedding to enjoy yourself and watch me happily get married, or are you coming to reap the benefits of free food and drinks? I even had a girl who told me her and her boyfriend broke up recently but to still keep her RSVP number the same because she wants to bring a date.  So, Reddit, What is wedding etiquette here? AITA here for telling everyone NO PLUS ONES unless you are married or unless the bride and/or groom KNOW them?  Can I contact these people and tell them I’m only RSVPing for the people on the invite?  EDIT: we have about 150 people coming to the wedding, most of which know each other. I have a friend from out of town coming who does not know many people and I did tell her she could bring a plus one so she wouldn’t feel alone.  I do realize that by saying “it’s MY wedding” does make me sound a little crazy. However, my parents are paying for the wedding and I’m trying to keep prices as low as possible.  We have a wedding website which we posted the URL on the RSVP and on the website it states “unless you were specifically addressed, please no plus ones.” And in the case of the people asking for the plus ones, all of them will know a fair amount of people at the wedding.  I am in the US if that helped cultural aspects.\n",
      "For context, I'm a college student who is taking an extremely heavy course load with the main heavy-hitters in terms in classes. I am also the under the legal age for drinking which my roommates seem to think means that I can play DD, weekdays and weekends, and that I can stay up and take care of their drunk selves (basically, when they are drunk and have friends over, it's like taking care of 3-6 drunk toddlers in the terrible twos).   I have told them repeatedly that I don't want to stay up and have even gone to the lengths of drinking by myself (it's only a wine of glass if even that, but enough that I have a legitimate excuse for staying in and not getting behind the wheel of a car). In addition, it's usually between 2-5am when they are calling and my classes start at 9am.  I stay up with the lights off, or wake up when they come back in (they are super loud even with headphones on) to make sure they get home safe but I find it extremely annoying that they are treating me like a live-in DD and one has started to get snippety with me when she calls asking even though I told her beforehand that I'm not driving them back. My thought process is that if they asked me and I knew that I would be staying up then that would be one thing but they refuse to find other drivers or even have one of the group act as a designated driver which I find to be stupid AITA?  &#x200B;  Basically: Tired and stressed college wants to know if AITA for not obeying the demands of roommates who want to drink a lot and won't find other rides wanting them to be an on-call, live-in designated driver refusing to drive them back?\n",
      "So some backstory here. A few days ago, my BIL got arrested for some involvement with drugs. I'm not going to get into all the details, but it's been especially hard on our family given that my MIL is a police officer in the same municipality and our nephew was present. We had heard some rumors, but it's his first time around with this kind of thing, and it was still a shock to us. Everyone is on an emotional rollercoaster right now, myself included.   Word spread pretty fast about what happened. Most people have either avoided the subject completely unless I bring it up, or offered their support and that was the end of it. Then comes this friend, we'll call her Sam for the sake of the story. Sam and I have only known each other for maybe 6 months.  Sam starts out by texting me, asking how I'm doing. I tell her I'm doing alright, thank her for the concern. She starts pushing the subject further, asking for more details. I tell her that I'm not really in the mood to discuss the situation. She didn't take the hint. She kept pushing further and further, so I was just very short with her. I didn't say anything rude. She starts asking if she upset me. I told her no, I just don't want to talk. However, I'm starting to get pretty upset. She keeps apologizing for possibly upsetting me, and then starts turning the conversation to her own family problems, and trying to compare them to my situation. By this point, I've had it, so I just quit answering her before I got to the point that I did say something rude. She's texted me several times over the last day or so now, but I still haven't answered her. This kind of behavior freaks me out a bit, especially since I've only known her for a few months. I'm also not a very open and social person. Everyone that's ever been around me knows this.  Part of me feels like an asshole for ignoring her. However, I feel like I gave her enough indication that I didn't want to talk about it. AITA?\n",
      "My ex and I broke up a few weeks ago after I caught her planning to cheat on me with her ex and also flirting with a few other guys on facebook.  Well shortly before the breakup two of her friends asked me to look at a phone and laptop that weren't working.  I work in IT so this type of request is common for me.  I said I'd take a look, but before that happened the breakup occurred.  Well these friends obviously sided with my ex after the breakup and publicly stated that I was overreacting and was more at fault than ex in the breakup.  Well the next day I returned the devices to those two explaining that I wasn't going to fix them.  Since then I've gotten numerous messages from them, my ex, and a few mutual friends telling me that I am being petty and childish and needlessly punishing them for my ex's behavior.  A few have also said I am obligated to help since I promised to look at them and the breakup doesn't absolve me of that responsibility.  I personally think this is all bullshit, but the fact that so many people are coming after me on this is making me doubt myself.  Was I the asshole here?\n",
      "My friend make paracord dog collars and leads and I've always loved the style but haven't been in the position to pay £30 for a collar and £20 for a lead for each of my 4 dogs as since she started up money has been tight due to being off work to an injury.  I'm a pretty craft person and pick up new crafts quickly so I decided to buy some paracord etc and get to work while I'm bed bound recovering from surgery. I will admit the supplies came nowhere near £30 per collar and £20 per lead. I actually got all 4 made for just over the price of one collar.   I was really pleased with the results and a few days later without thinking I got my husband to take a picture of the 4 dogs in bed with me and posted it on Facebook saying I was recovering well with my doggy Dr's by my side. Not long after I received a very angry pm from my friend saying she's shocked I went elsewhere to buy new dog collars when it's the type she makes and that if I had have told her I was buying elsewhere then she could have given me a discount. I messaged her back explaining I had made them myself while recovering to give myself something to do. This lead to another message from her saying she can't believe I would stoop so low as to steal her craft from her just to save some money and that I've probably done such a bad job that they'll fall apart.   I haven't replied back to her and wasn't planning on it but I've not long saw her status saying she knows a back stabbing bitch and I can't help wonder if I've done the wrong thing\n",
      "My roommate has a friend who is in a very rocky relationship. She's married and has a baby but the husband has got a lot of issues. Like he is threatening her by saying he's going to take a knife to his wrists if she leaves him.  Now my roommate has been flirting with her a bunch, he's aware of the rocky relationship but he has really fallen for her. He already had her at the apartment two nights in a row to escape the husband and supposedly she has no where else to go.   While he was working my roommate dropped the question if I could handle living with a baby for two months, despite me telling him repeatedly I'm not living with a baby especially because I smoke pot and have lots of friends over and during the night time hours. He is sold on this being her only choice and I told him this really shouldn't be our place to be getting involved. Especially since she hasn't divorced him or anything.   I told him no, she can't move in with her baby. Not only would it be an awful experience for myself but I can't imagine any positive outcome coming out for either one of them. AITI?  EDIT: Thank you all for your replies, I was so happy to hear I wasn't alone in thinking this is bad. What I ended up doing is calling my father who is a police officer and he just told me that she has to call Access, and that I should expect the worst to happen. She went back to his place last night and my father is saying she will more thank likely tell him where we live and if he's threatening with self harm to have come back then he'll probably do the same with figuring out where we live.   TLDR Roommate wants his gf who's married with a baby move into my stoner den apartment and I told him no.\n",
      "My friend Taylar makes baby blankets. I’ve known her since childhood and I really wanted to get my (sister), a baby blanket in honor of her rainbow baby that would’ve been born this week.   I posted about it on my friends FB, not DM like I thought. Total accident and my sister is in tears crying at me on the phone because how dare I try to get her that blanket? Her baby, her business.  I’m so crushed because I’ve wanted to be an aunt for so long, I was so supportive during pregnancy, then she lost her baby at like (15wk). I even started a closet full of clearance for the nieces/nephews. Am I the A-hole? I apologized and told her I meant no harm, didn’t realize T was her FB friend too.\n",
      "I wasn't sure where to post this, but this seems like the best sub. So, in the country where I'm from, quarantine has been lifted about two weeks ago, or so I think. I'm not sure. The thing is, I haven't gone outside, except for going to the post office and to a market. Today, my mother confronted me about how I should spend less time on the computer, and more time outside (the classic parent stuff). And then she said that the problem is that I'm inside a lot, not specifically the computer. I explained that I like being inside more. She then started comparing me to other kids, like how they're going outside, and how I'm not hanging out with anyone. So, sure, I spend a lot of time in my house, but that's just what I like. I don't see the point of going outside just for the sake of it. So, am I the asshole in this situation?\n",
      "In ~2010, my brother started dating his ex girlfriend, A. I had been friends with her for a couple years prior and they met through me. During their relationship. A, my best friend P, and I all spent a lot of time together and we all were close. Four years in, A and my brother were rocky when A’s friend G swooped in and started dating my brother, getting pregnant ~2 months later. This obviously caused a lot of drama. G passionately hated A. I tried to maintain my friendship with A but we inevitably had a falling out as I felt like I had to choose between her and my brother. I made a sacrifice because I knew G was going to be around for a while and I didn’t want to jeopardize my family’s relationship with her as they wanted to be in the baby’s life. My brother married G and they now have two children together. I never liked the type of person G was, but I put in a lot of effort to have a good relationship with her because she is family. Everything has been great for a few years. 2 years ago, I moved out of state with my boyfriend and because of the distance, I now hardly see or talk to her, but there were no problems.  Fast forward to October, 2019. My best friend P was killed in a car accident. I was and still am absolutely devastated. A found out through the grapevine and sent me a message on social media expressing her condolences and apologizing for us having a falling out. I responded apologizing for the faults on my end, and I agreed that it was water under the bridge. We shared memories of our time spent with P. A is now married, has children of her own, and is very happy. We then followed each other and a couple weeks later, she commented on a picture I had posted of P.   Not long after, I received a phone call from my brother and G. Long story short, G saw the comments and was furious. She called me a bitch for talking to A. I calmly explained that the only reason we spoke was because of P’s death. G said she understood why I spoke with A, she’s just shocked I’d do something like that and is convinced I am a liar and that I am fake because I promised her I’d never speak to A again (I have zero memory of this). I said that regardless of whether or not I ever made that promise, the rules don’t apply in this situation. I was the person that called people P knew to inform them of her death, and I had to talk to a few people I don’t particularly like, but you put your bullshit aside because there are more important things going on.   I’ve been in a bad place mentally over losing P and my patience for G was very low given the situation. I promptly told her that I am 27, I’m not her girlfriend, who I talk to is none of her business and her being my SIL does not put her in a position of authority to dictate that. It’s been a couple weeks and she just called my parents and told them she thinks I’m a bad person (which didn’t go well for her).   AITA?\n",
      "I've (M26) had a difficult life trying to connect with my father and his family. I've managed to reconnect and so far I've reached out to my Father, MIL, Siblings and step siblings. My step brother is a felon but has a career setup for him. Capitalism has been beneficial for me (sad to say) so a lot of our conversations are based on how my job/income is and how that lays a foundation of success for myself in my life. He ends up hitting me up for quick cash here and there but I don't see a reason to actually reach out and help considering he only talks to me when he needs money or when he hears I'm advancing in my field. AITA for not wanting to help?\n",
      "My Fantasy Football league is a $250 buy-in 12-team league with just 4 teams in the playoffs. It's a work league. Money distribution:  1st - $1200 2nd - $900 3rd - $600 4th - $300   For those who aren't aware, a player went into cardiac arrest on the field and the game was suspended, and no decision has been made on whether it will resume. I am currently playing in the third-place game, leading by 2.5, and my opponent had a kicker in the game that was suspended. The league's commissioner has just asked if I'm cool with calling the game a tie and splitting $450 rather than getting $600 (or potentially $300). Currently I am feeling like I don't want to do this.  Before I continue, I want to make it very clear that I feel awful for this player, his team, his family, and everyone else involved, and I am not trying to be callous or indifferent to the circumstances. The event was tragic and I sincerely, desperately hope that he ends up okay. He is currently still in critical condition in the hospital as far as I'm aware.  To understand why, I have to go back two weeks. A guy in the league was on vacation, and apparently doesn't know how to set his lineup from his phone. He left a player on IR (injured reserve, meaning it was known that this player would not play for at least four weeks) in his starting lineup and a star player on his bench. It was an obvious mistake that I felt the commissioner should have fixed (though I don't know if this player asked him to). He lost because of it. If he had won, he would have been my opponent in round 1 of the playoffs, and I would have beat him based on our scores last week - where he  did  set his lineup correctly - thus securing at least $900. Instead, I got an opponent who really shouldn't have been in the playoffs to begin with, but his team overperformed while mine underperformed and he beat me.  Getting into the ridiculous luck I've had this year would far exceed the character limit of this post, but just take my word for it when I tell you it's been brutal. My team scored the most points out of any team in the league this year but only finished 10-5 due to some insane matchup luck, and a guy going on vacation and not knowing how to work his phone has already cost me at least $300.  Long story short, I've gotten to the point where I just feel like rolling with whatever the Luck Ness Monster has in store. If the NFL doesn't end up continuing the game, that's bad luck for my opponent, but I've gotten a ton of bad luck this season and nobody's made concessions for me. If they  do  continue the game, my opponent will  probably  win (though it's not a certainty at all), and that's just a little more bad luck for me, and so be it.   TL;DR  had really bad fantasy luck that cost me a good deal so far, and now that my opponent  might  have gotten some insanely bad luck as well, the commissioner wants me to split my winnings with him. WIBTA if I said no, I want to go with our fantasy platform's final score?\n",
      "My (29F) husband (34M) and I have been together for a few years. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 13 and had a cancer scare a year ago (I go for repeat screenings every 6 months now). I am planning to go off the pill (for the first time in 16 years...) after Christmas. When I had my cervical cancer scare I didn't even tell my OWN parents or my siblings because I didn't want to worry them until we knew what we were dealing with -- I told my husband not to discuss it with his family either. Same with me being on the pill -- I told him not to disclose my health with his family because I'm not comfortable enough with them to share that (especially since they are LDS...)  Anyways, we take one vacation a year and are hypersensitive to that vacation this year because it will be the last trip we can take as just the two of us, assuming we can conceive. We told his family their Thanksgiving plans are too expensive (they want to take a cruise to Bahamas and we live in Phoenix -- it will cost nearly triple what we would spend on our one vacation) and we are trying to pay down debts and get into a strong financial position before we start discussing and planning the growth of our own family.  Of course his siblings and parents guilted him for saying no to plans and he overshared about our finances and personal plans. At one point in conversation with one of his sisters, he said \"you don't know this yet, but she's coming off the pill and we're going to have a kid soon.\"  After their phone call ended, I told him very calmly and clearly: \"I'm not mad at you, you can't take it back, but please don't share that information with your side of the family. I'm not comfortable with you discussing my health and my meds with them\". He got defensive and retorted that because his sister is a therapist she won't tell anyone else. I explained that we are not her clients and this is definitely something that will be shared at some point in passing. He then pushed back that he initially paused before saying something but then felt that if my side of the family knows -- which they DON'T -- it shouldn't matter for him to share that with his side of the family. I pushed back that even though we're married, my health is exactly that: MINE and it shouldn't be freely shared with people as part of a grocery list of reasons why we cannot do something.  We ended in a stalemate and dropped the conversation but even after 3 weeks it's still weighing on me. Part of me feels like our family planning is his life, too, but the other part of me feels like stating that I'm on the pill and when I intend to go off is just oversharing and not necessary.  So Reddit, am I the asshole for getting upset with my husband for sharing information about my health & meds?\n",
      "So I share a small apartment with my roommate. We both have a shared pantry, but my roommate buys snacks for herself and keeps them in her cupboard because she has the habit to binge eat. I thought it was weird at first but then I got used to it. She has an insanely fast metabolism and can eat like a truck without gaining a single pound, she might even lose weight doing this lol. Meanwhile I have to watch what I eat and keep my snacking to a minimum. So I asked her to not binge eat everything because I can only eat this kind of stuff once in a while and whenever I check to find something it's always gone. She said but that's the reason why she buys snacks for herself and I replied that she not only eats her stuff but she also eats what's in the pantry. She said that she always leaves half, but then I told her that by the time I can get to it it goes bad.   She suggested that I also buy snacks for myself but I reminded her that I need to be careful and I can't binge eat like her. So then she said \"okay I won't eat what's there in the pantry but if it's not there for eating then what is it there for? If you need to eat it so bad just take it to your room and claim it's yours, I won't even touch it\". I told her that I can't do that because then I'll be tempted to eat it. She then said that I need to have control over myself.   So then I got mad and said that you're the one who needs to have control over herself because I don't eat like a truck and you do, you need to stop filling your emotional wounds with food and to not eat anything and everything in your sight.   She then got upset and said \"I'll fill my wounds with whatever tf I want, stay out of it and it's not my fault you get fat easily. You need to have self control.\"  After this I got a call from one of our common friends who said I shouldn't have said that.   So AITA?\n",
      "I live with my grandmother, and she's very religious, so once she made me visit her church and I went. There was a poster all crooked and ugly, so when I got home I said I didn't like that poster much and could make it cuter. My grandmother the other day came from church saying that the woman who made the poster was very sad because I said I hated the poster. MY GRANDMA TOLD TO WOMAN, INCREASED HISTORY AND PASSED ME AS THE VILLA OF HISTORY! Well, I told the situation to some friends and they said I was a jerk about it and she had reasons because I had been annoying with her. Well, that sounds silly, but guys, was I the asshole?\n",
      "I, 35 male, has a brother who we will call Melvin, 32 male. Melvin has a wife, 30 female, and they have a very unhealthy marriage. My sister in law who we will call Martha was forced by her parents to marry my brother because he had a stable job. She had no other choice but to say yes because her family believed women don’t have a say in anything. My brother Melvin is a huge jerk and makes sexist jokes towards women. Fast forward too after the marriage Melvin and Martha invited the family to their house for a gathering. They acted very fake towards eachother to a point that it was convincing they had a wholesome relationship. Martha sat down after she cooked everyone food and that’s when my older brother was red with anger, he stood up tall and scolded at his wife and said “Go back to the kitchen, isnt that your job” I told my brother that she should treat his wife with respect because she is making your house like a home and is why you have food on the table. My mum told me to calm down but I didn’t listen, I was so sick of my brother making sexist remarks. I then said how his wife deserves a man who actually treats him with respect. I left the dinner and went back to my home where my wife and daughter where. I’m so happy that I put some sense into my brother. However the next day I was harassed with phone calls by my brother and his in laws saying i was being such a pussy for defending my wife”when I was treating her with respect. I blocked them all off. So am I the idiot?\n",
      "was lurking and found a post like my own situation and was curious to see my results  I know we are bad parents for doing this but somehow we always subconsciously favored our older daughter over our younger when they were growing up. We didn’t really realize it, but looking back it was pretty terrible.   My youngest daughter was about to be wed to her ex (unfortunately my now son in law) when my oldest daughter came clean to her about 2 days before the wedding that she was having an affair with the youngest’s fiancé.   After we found out about this, we took our youngest’s side and we went with her to her honeymoon without telling her fiancé or my oldest, leaving them to deal with the wedding mess.   Oldest married the ex and now he is my son in law. They had a child together (born relatively soon after the catastrophe). I wasn’t involved much in her pregnancy or with the baby because my younger daughter was going through serious mental issues as a result of the cheating. I had to focus on her. My husband and I took her on a vacation when my oldest was giving birth. I know it sounds bad but my youngest was going through a lot of issues both at work and home and we wanted to give her a change of environment. Her issues were very very serious.   Thankfully, my younger daughter has turned out fine and had a child of her own. I was heavily involved in her pregnancy. I was in the room with her when she gave birth and helped her with the baby tremendously.   I have distanced myself from my older daughter for my younger and as a result of that, I’m not as close to my oldest’s children. When all the children are under one roof, I treat them the same, but as I am closer to the youngest, I also just know a lot more about her daughter. Like how much she needs to eat, what her favorites are, her schedule, etc. I’ve tried to get close to my other grandchildren too, but it’s difficult since my oldest does not want to leave them alone with me for a long time.   After seeing my interactions with my granddaughter, my oldest has accused me of favoritism. She went off at me at how I’m so used to doing this and I wasn’t even there to support her during labor and how scared she was.   I feel bad because I’ve done this in the past, but this time I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong. AITA?  Edit: I’ve been looking through my post to see if it was clear or not and have made some minor edits. Also, the older daughter accused me of favoritism for the grandchildren not between her and her sister. She thinks that the grandchildren are going to be resentful in the future for “being treated this way”. I asked my 6year old grandson if he feels neglected by us (grandparents) and felt like we liked her cousin more. He said “nope” and we hugged. But he’s also 6 so maybe he may feel differently in the future.  Edit: I’d like for you all to make decisions based on my behavior now. I know I was a terrible mother/worst asshole in the past. I was really bad, but I’ve been trying to make up for it and my youngest and I have repaired our relationship. If you guys still think that I am acting like an asshole and should do something different, then I will accept your judgement and try to fix it.\n",
      "In short: My mom wants to talk with me daily, I refuse it in defence of my own mental health. She says I'm ungrateful.  Am I being an AITA?  My mom (F80) wants me (F40) phone her everyday as she is lonely. She lives with my dad (M82) 5 000 km away in another country, and complains that she has no one to talk to. But we have a long history of not getting on well. When I was little, she used to treat me bad. Not physically (sometimes yes), but more psychologically. Like telling me how stupid I am and ugly, and not deserved to be loved. Or that I have bad temper and when kids were bullying me, that was my fault (because of my dad's job we lived in many countries, which meant changing school 4 times). Or that I don't deserve to be happy as she wasn't happy. When she was upset at my dad she would wake me up in the middle of the night to scream at me instead of screaming at him. There were worse things, I could go on and on, but you get the picture. And my father turned a blind eye on all that, and if I ever tried to complain, he said it was my fault.  I spent months and years in therapy to mentally put myself in a better way, to build my self esteem, to divorce my abusive husband (of course she blamed me) from who I escaped with 2 small children. I try to talk to them as less as I can, but they demand to talk every weekend on Skype. That I can bare, but not more than that.  In the last year her health was declining, and (probably?) she realised how bad she was acting? Or just as usual her needs comes first, and she wants more attention again? I don't know, and don't want to know. When I was little I thought that was the \"normal\" parental love, but when I had my children, I realised that it was not love. I don't know what it was, cause it's between \"simple\" gaslighting to bullying to narcissism, I just know that I don't want them in my life. But in the meantime, I'm not a monster, they are old, their health is declining, and at one point they will need constant help. And I'm terrified of that time. Now she wants \"just\" to talk everyday, but then they will need everyday physical help.  Also, my mother's side of the family wants me to spend more time with her, and calling me ungrateful and that she was right to treat me as she pleased. Because she acted out of love... Am I an AITA for putting my own mental health before caring for them?\n",
      "I was withy ex for about 1.5-2 years, and we have a kid together. This person would kick me out in the rain, yell at me and berate me, cheat, lie, sexually assault me, and finally they did hit me towards the end. I ended it because we were having a kid, and I have full custody because they wanted $6000 in child support forgiven, so I basically paid $6000 for custody.  This person is SO terrible that we went to the same therapist for a while, and when I told this therapist who I was seeing, they got really serious and said, “You need to get out of that relationship. I’m telling you that’s not a good idea, but I can’t tell you why.”  I feel bad because I told their last two partners about this, but they didn’t believe me til it happened to them and their lives were effectively ruined. They have custody of their other kids and recently got married, and idk if I should tell their new spouse.  I feel responsible when something happens to their partners, like I should do something, but maybe it doesn’t matter since the other two didn’t believe me & it happened anyway.  Sorry about the grammar & piss poor writing; I’m pretty upset.\n",
      "I commented on a tiktok tok video of a guy pulling himself out the pool. All I said was \"pale guys are my weakness\" since I have a type and kind of thirst follow on tiktok. I also follow specific hobbies but that's irrelevant.   For a couple of weeks people replied calling me racist and ignorant but wouldn't explain when I asked them how. Then the original poster deleted my comment. AITA for having a type?\n",
      "I already posted this somewhere else but it fits here as well.   Our parents died when I was young so my my two older sisters raised me and my other sister. We were always short on money so they couldn’t afford to buy us a lot of things. However on my 15th birthday I was given my first pair of vans and they were white. My sister had a boyfriend at the time being 17 and all so he invited her to a family party and she asked me if she could burrow my vans. I’ve always hated sharing and didn’t want to let her use them but I was in a good mood and told her she could. It had rained for a couple of days so I asked her to please take care of them and not get them muddy. She come back on the next day evening and since she had a part time job she left but my shoes were left on the doorway completely muddy. Well the mud was dry already but they were white shoes come on. I didn’t even have time to confront her about the issue but I was so pissed and annoyed at her that she couldn’t even do the simplest thing. I was alone that day in the apartment and thought of a way to get back at her for my self satisfaction. We all know of that hack of using toothpaste to clean white shoes so I scrubbed them for like half an hour with toothpaste and her toothbrush and I’ve never done something so petty in my life. I don’t regret it till this day and haven’t told anyone personally. I guess at some point I did feel regret whenever she was nice all of a sudden but I end up taking it back.   Also I forgot to mention that she’s those kind of people that believes they’re always right and will disagree with you about anything. She’ll belittle anything you like or show any interest in and I hate that about her. I’m pretty sure if I hadn’t let her burrow my shoes she’d have made my entire weekend miserable.   Edit: she didn’t get sick and it’s not the first time she burrows my things and brings them back damaged. I’ve confronted her about these things and she just doesn’t care. Me being the youngest my opinión doesn’t matter to her or my other sisters. That was the first and last time I did something out of revenge and it was 4 years ago.\n",
      "for context im 25 and live with my grandma and have been for years.  my grandma works nights and for years my youngest brother has come to stay with us on weekends on and off. as he has gotten older, he has become more and more of a piece of shit. not that surprising of a teenager(16) and I'm more or less ok with it. they are young and learning still.  he talks shit, ill talk shit back. I try to treat him how he is supposed to be, a kid becoming an adult.  the problems come when he starts disrespecting me. especially when he has his friends come over. the shit-talking gets worse, he stops listening to me, is loud as hell at night when I have neighbors upstairs, and more. his friends then follow his example.  when I do try to do anything they act like I'm just being an asshole and then act like what they were doing wasn't as bad to get most of my family on their side.  my grandma wants to act like they are still 10-12 and I'm sick of it!  just tonight (around 11:45 PM) he and his friends start talking about going upstairs to grab something from a friend. it would take 2 minutes, but I told them no. they are loud as hell and 1 neighbor has complained about them running up and downstairs at night.  they ignore me and as soon as they get back my brother says \"what's the worst he's going to do? ground me?\" sarcastically.  when I yelled at him, he brought up how it is my grandma's house and I'm not working. (even when I was working he would still do this)  the worst thing about it, there is nothing I can do about it. it's not like I can hurt him, nor ground him. there is literally nothing I can really do without getting my grandma or his dad involved.  the moment I get grandma involved, I already know how she is going to react. trying to downplay it or something. but I've had enough. she wouldn't let them stay here by themselves and I know it. so the only way he would be able to stay the night would be if it's on one of her few nights off. (she gets called in a lot.)  I'm just sick of the constant disrespect in my own home. (I'm on the lease.) but feeling like there is nothing I can do about it and watch as he becomes a piece of spiled shit.  it's not like I act unreasonable. \"hey keep it down it's midnight.\" \"no you can't leave, it's dark out.\" \"stop screaming at the PS4, it's 3 in the morning.\" \"stop eating dry roman in the living room, your getting shit everywhere.\"  in the morning, I'm going to talk to my grandma and make it clear that if something doesn't change, I won't watch him. he will be free to do whatever the fuck he wants unless she is here to keep him in line.  to her, I know ill be a bit of an asshole. she wants her grandson to come over and hang out and stuff. she is also very hardworking and I try my best to do what I can for her when I can. but I can only take so much disrespect that she doesn't even see.\n",
      "So over the weekend like many homes in the tri-state area my parents (67 and 63) basement flooded. Im currently in a different state about 4 hours away. They were away on vacation but my older brother (34) was home. He saw the flood but didn't do anything to stop it and waited till my folks came home the next day to even assess the damage.   My folks came home a day early and assessed the damage and saw it was mostly stuff we had in storage that needed to be thrown out with the occasional sentimental item. They are one step away from being hoarders and so there is lot of \"collectibles\" to throw out. Aside from that the pilot light is out and a few other things. They even hired some men to help take everything out. They never once asked me to come down and in fact said if i did ask they would have told me not to come.  Flash foward to today and now they are yelling at me for not coming to help and for enjoying my life, ( i went out to a nice restaurant and was met with alot of ire).   Am I The Asshole for not dropping everything to be in a house with no hot water and to pick up the slack for my lazy brother?\n",
      "For some context, I am a rental property manager in a college town in the southeast.  Many of the properties/rentals are near the university so my main tenant demographic is early 20's undergrad students.  This week I had a house turning (tenants moved out and new tenants moved in) so the day after the old tenants moved out my maintenance team went in to make repairs and replacements.  Shortly after arriving the maintenance supervisor called me to let me know there were two dogs on the property.  I took a ride out to the house and sure enough one of the previous tenants had left their two 60+ lbs dogs behind.  My company is very pet friend so we immediately started trying to communicate with the former tenants as well as looking for a home for both dogs.  I was really hoping i was just a big misunderstanding but no, they were abandoned. This specific rental is a four bedroom house and 4 male students had just moved out.  After several calls and text only one of the former roommates who is not even the dog owner responded to me regarding the dogs.  He had actually moved out couple weeks early and didn't even know the dogs had been left.  I think we can all agree abandoning an animal is abuse and just totally unacceptable behavior.  Here is the issue,  the type of lease I use basically views the all parties on the lease as one unit.  It isn't a by the bedroom lease so when there are multiple parties on the lease when one tenant violates a term technically all of the tenants have violated the term.  I have no sympathy for the dude who left the dogs behind and would file the charges against him in a heartbeat if he was the only person on the contract.  The reason I am hesitant is because I would have to file the charges for animal neglect on everyone, all four tenants on the lease.  I do think the dog owner deserves hella negative consequences for leaving these innocent living beings behind to fend for themselves.   These charges could seriously impact their ability to rent in the future. It wouldn't just be the dog owner it would be all four parties.  It will come up on their background check if found guilty and on their rental history report. They're young and dumb obviously just starting out their adult life.   I am not sure if I should go through with it.  Should the other three be punished and suffer the long term impact because of the actions of one of their roommates? Especially the guy who moved out early?  If I could ensure it would only impact the dog owner it would be a no-brainer but I can't so yeah again... WIBTA if I filed the charges on the whole group?\n",
      "This Tuesday, August 10th, my wife (25F) and I (28M) notarized our marriage application and mailed it off. We're both teachers in Miami and Tuesday was our last day of summer break. We had a late breakfast that morning and talked about getting married before the school year began. Fast forward 3 hours and we were at a notary with my brother and his girlfriend (21M&F) as our witness. My sister (25F) was away in Orlando until Thursday with her friend and so she would not have been able to join.  To be more clear, the timeline of events are as follows:    Noonish: Decide we want to get married that day while sipping coffee at home  1pm-ish: Getting my tux ready, making backup copies of paperwork, and looking up notary publics.   2pm-ish: Go dress shopping at a boutique in Midtown and grab sports wedding bands (temporary).  4pm: Pick up my brother and his girlfriend.  5pm: Papers are notarized in a very unceremonious fashion, (just signing paperwork in an office),  we share a bottle of champagne, get some pics together, and went to our favorite restaurant for dinner.   8pm: Order an Uber for brother and his girlfriend and get to bed, as we have to be up early for work the next day.   Fast forward to now, my sister has arrived from her trip, cried at home, messaged us her disappointment, and has blocked us on iMessage. We had planned to get dressed up again this weekend to celebrate and get pictures with her, but she says she wants nothing to do with us.   Now for my wife's side of the family, with her parents not living in Florida, they took the news well and congratulated us. One of her sisters would not have been able to make it, and the other lives an hour away in West Palm Beach with her husband and is taking care of a one year old. We will be seeing them this weekend to dress up, celebrate, and get some photos.   My parents who are in Spain seem to have taken her side and think we were being selfish, and they don't care to help de-escalate the situation. We would still like to get some photos with my sister this weekend and I don't want my frustration to get in the way of a peaceful resolution. My wife and I were just following our hearts and couldn't wait to be married.  REMOVED PROOF BECAUSE IT HAD A LAST NAME VISIBLE, SORRY.   FINAL EDIT: We brought her a money tree and two bottles of champagne along with a heartfelt handwritten note. She ignored us angrily upon getting home, but after seeing our gift and reading the note when she got inside, she came back out in tears to forgive us. I think, we kinda were assholes for not waiting, but also we were just doing what we wanted and she forgave us.\n",

      "English isn't my first language.  I'm a regular at my local bar and spend a lot of time drinking with familiar faces and watching the game there with friends. The other day a woman approached me there and started making small talk and we got to chatting fairly well. She was clearly flirting and I was interested at first, but she said \"you can buy me a drink if you want\" and I started laughing because it seemed so presumptuous. She must have thought I was playing around because we went back to talking and she invited me out for dinner the next night and I agreed.  We went to dinner and talked more and everything was going well until it came time to pay. The bills came and she didn't even reach for her wallet once, just looked at me expecting something. I told the server two bills and paid for my own and she just kind of stared at me then paid for her own. When we went our own ways I texted her and told her I didn't want a second date.  It put me off that her initial idea of flirting is by suggesting I buy her something, it didn't come across as if she seen us as equals, almost like I was expected to impress her even though it was her who approached me. Then when we went to dinner even though she invited me (if I invited her I would have paid) she expected me to pay automatically instead of splitting. She is otherwise very polite but it came across as very entitled like I had to pay for the privilege of her time or I'm expected to put her on a pedestal. It made me feel like she thought she was better than me. My friends say I am being an asshole, and so did she when I told her no second date. AITA?\n",
      "I (28F) have a friend, Ashley (28F). She has twin boys (6) and her and her husband are extremely wealthy and do spoil the twins. But the twins are very polite kids and extremely sweet.   For their birthday, they had a Bluey themed party. For those who don’t know, please look it up, the show is absolutely adorable and my daughter loves it too.   Ashley went all out and clearly spent a lot. They even had people come in dressed as the characters. The boys and other kids including my daughter were AMAZED. It was so darn cute.   The thing is, ever since the party, my daughter has been BEGGING me and her dad to throw her a party just like theirs. But we don’t have the budget.   It makes me feel guilty for not being able to give my daughter the party she wants but I’m trying to make things as similar as possible. My brother agreed to make a Bluey birthday cake and my nieces are going to dress up as the characters. I’ve also even managed to find some decorations. It isn’t as fancy as theirs but it’s all I can afford and I’ve made peace with it.   My boyfriend is really hung up about it though, even more than I am. He feels like shit for having to find cheaper options and is convinced our daughter’s going to be heartbroken. I have tried comforting him and thought he would be alright.  But yesterday I got a call from Ashley and she told me that my boyfriend called her husband and started yelling at him for spoiling the twins, trying to show off and making other less fortunate parents look like shit. He also said something about how Bluey is a girl and asked why they dressed their twins up in Bluey costumes when they’re boys.   I apologized immediately and explained the situation to her. She told me that it’s okay and it’s all water under the bridge.   I was still really upset and embarrassed though. My boyfriend said he was sorry and doesn’t know what came over him but I wouldn’t hear it. I told him that he can’t take out his insecurities on an innocent family.  That struck a nerve and he told me that he just felt horrible and felt like he was failing as a father and I’m no help. He then went to the washroom and cried. I feel a little guilty now but I’m still horrified by the fact that he called them just to insult them. They’ve been nothing but kind and have helped us out a lot. Their twins are also really close to our daughter and I don’t want to ruin that. AITA?\n",
      "My friend (19F) and I (19F) were planning to go to a concert in February 2023. I asked her if I could book tickets and that we would go together and she agreed. I booked the tickets on April 22nd 2022, which was around 9-10 months away from concert and plenty of time to plan.  We had small and brief discussions in which we went over the basics, since it was in a different state we planned to fly over together. We were going to go JUST the two of us, that was what I thought was the plan, we had gone over other stuff such as letting my mum drive us but we both decided that it was best the two of us go together and fly there.  After we had sorted this out, I get a text from her saying that her stepmother was now going and she was going with her instead. She asked me if I was okay to go with my mum and if she was able to drive me there. I tried to work with her and the new plan that seemed to be forming and I asked my mum and she said yes, she wasn't in the best of moods but I knew she would come around later and we could all make a solid plan closer to the date. I expected her stepmom would want to atleast talk to my mum about the whole thing given we were all going now. She also asked when my mum agreed, If my mum could drive her back her home afterwards with us whilst her stepmom flew back. My mum also said yes, knowing there would probably be a more solid plan to come when the two of them talked at a later date and closer to the concert.  A while later in the day after asking, my mum wasn't too happy about the idea of copping out ALOT of money (for food, fuel etc.) driving back and forth between states and the fact she had to drive my friend back too. So I messaged her and told her that my mum didn't actually want to do that. Then she messaged back that she had already brought PLANE TICKETS?!?!?!? ( she also booked the hotel she was going to be staying in) the concert was mind you like 9-10 months away, I don't understand WHY she had to book tickets and not tell me about it when we were supposed to definitely have a more solid plan and we hadn't even discussed anything in person??????? She said that that was the only option for us and there was no other way for us to go together anymore and that my mum was the only way she could get home now.  So I tried to work with her, I tried to bend every bone in my body to her will so we could make this work. I should make it known now that I have severe anxiety and social anxiety, My friend knows about my anxiety yet she didn't do anything to ease it in the slightest about the whole trip planning ( I even offered to fly alone which would've been extremely nerve wracking and anxiety inducing for me yet she didn't object) I also offered many other ways of getting there and even asked to catch up in person in trying to reorganise the plans and make new plans. But she was adamant that the only way she was going was if my mum came and drove her back home.  After the whole thing, we went our seperate ways. I stopped talking to her. I know it's stupid because it's just a concert.  Am I the asshole because I stopped talking to her?  &#x200B;  OH: also she never apologised but I did.\n",
      "My sister named M and I have always been close. We talk on the phone about every other week or more. For the last few years every conversation has been controlled by her and the problems between her and her husband named G. He doesn't want to talk about their issues, he gaslights her, she gaslights him they disagree on how to raise and punish their kids they fight every day they agree on nothing. She wants therapy and he refuses. He is too strict with the kids. His parents are mean to the kids telling them to shut-up at times. Kids are 5, 3, and 1. She has multiple times mentioned regretting marrying him and how maybe she should just take the kids and leave before divorce happens.  I chatted with my parents. I asked them for advice, how to ask M to stop always complaining and monopolizing the conversation so we could just chat. They told me to tell her that her constant negative conversations needed to stop, I was happy to listen, but I would also like to talk about what's going on in my life.  I took their advice and the next time my sister and I chatted I had the above conversation.   She agreed she had been monopolizing time and let me talk for a bit. Within a few months we were back to the same thing. So I reminded her and that worked for one week. Everytime we talked I gave her the same advice. Get therapy for yourself and for your husband and figure out things.  About a month ago was the last time we talked. During that conversation we talked about how they were moving to a new state because she was taking a new job. G also was getting a new job and he didn't even ask about wage and she feels like he's lying about the actual job, etc. I asked her if she confronted him about it and she said she tried but he just won't talk to her.  So I said, and I quote \"M, I'm tired of this. I've told you I don't like being complained to every time we talk. I'm having surgery in 2 weeks and this is the first time I get to tell you. Its been planned since January. Why do you think that is?\"  She responded with \"its your fault for not talking more. Uou should have told me sooner. What's wrong with you!?\"  So I said \"M grow up. Get a marriage counselor and figure out the problems you and G have before your marriage collapses. And stop complaining until you do.\"  She hung up so I took that as the end of the conversation. I was talking to my Mom earlier today and she brought it up and asked for my side. My sister twisted the conversation a lot. I told my mom my side. She told me that M wants me to apologize and that she didn't want to talk to me until I did. My mom said she didn't care what I did and that it was up to me and that I'd always have my mom and dad.  My dad then told me that this type of stuff is why he doesn't talk to his sisters and he'd understand if I stopped talking to M too. And then asked me if I wanted him to talk to her and remind her of his past. I asked him not to.  AITA?\n",
      "Context: My dad has always been fond of his family, mostly because my grandma raised him by herself. She raised my dad and his sister by herself and worked multiple jobs at once so my dad is very grateful for her. My family (me, mom, dad, and brother) lived with my grandma, grandpa, aunt, her child, and 2 housemaids (all are related to my dad except the housemaids). We lived with them for about 10 years before we moved to another country.  We lived here for about 6 years before my grandma decided to come to visit us. About this time, my mom started telling me about what my grandma (A) did. A didn't approve of my mom and has been mentally abusive towards her for about 15 years of her living in that house. When she was pregnant, A wouldn't allow the housemaids to help her, and she had to cook and clean by herself. Note that she was paying for the housemaids. And of course, my dad didn't help. A has about 14 siblings, in which she has called over for a \"family meeting\" every time my mom makes a minor mistake. She would sometimes even call over my mom's parents because of her actions. She told people things like how grateful my mom should be for my dad because he made much more money.  I have reasons to believe in all of this.   My grandma has always been unreasonable. She would scream and shout at everyone in the house when she was not in a good mood.   She kicked my brother out of the house once during his teenage phase.  She never liked my mom. Everyone knows this.  She called her siblings over for a \"family meeting\" when my brother was rebellious towards her.  I have seen a few instances of this, although they were less extreme. And my dad never once defended my mom.   Fast forward about 10 years. She came to visit us. And while I am not exactly rude towards her, I don't feel welcome to her. I.e I refused to take her to go shopping 1 on 1; I refused to spend time with her while my parents are away; refused to give up my car seat.  My grandma has gotten better over the year (mostly cause we live so far away.) She gave me about $1500 for uni tuition. And the flight ticket was about $2000 both ways. On top of that, my dad said if anything happens she will give him the money which will go towards me anyways; which is why he started calling me TA. He told me I'm being very ungrateful without hearing her side, which I don't believe there should be any reason a pregnant woman should be forced to do housework by themselves while paying for the housemaids. All the things he said come from monetary values rather than emotional ones. My mom has supported me with my depression (which my dad was a big part of the cause btw) and I just love her a lot to ignore this.  So, AITA for my attitude towards my grandma?\n",
      "The title is for something I know is bound to happen some time because she often leaves stuff in the car, and asks me to retrieve it.  But recently, when I went to go sit in the car to wait for her, she asked me to turn on the car and the AC. I got in on the passenger side, and when I went to turn the car on, it told me that I need to step on the brake, something that I forgot. So when I go to move to the driver’s side, my dumbass hits the button that locks all the doors as I got out. I accidentally lock the keys in the car because I had placed it in this little compartment made for them. I start panicking, knowing my mom was going to be extremely pissed. She was, but the keys were easily retrieved with an easy and at-no-cost call to AAA.  She was still not happy, and pretty much was hostile and moody with me for the rest of the day.  Since that day, she basically doesn’t trust me with the key right now. Which is fine, I guess. I locked the key inside the car, and she doesn’t want that happening again. I keep telling her it won’t, but of course, she might not trust that at the moment. But when I thought she’d be over it by now, she’s not.  When I wanted to go sit in the car on a different day, she had this little sneer and said, “Hell no,” but the way she said it kinda rubbed me the wrong way,  Then tonight, damn near a week later after the incident, I asked to go get some water bottles from the car, she initially said yes, but then said, “You sure can when I leave for work.” I can’t describe the tone and look she had on her face, but it basically expressed that she still didn’t trust me. Even when we got to the car, she opened the fucking trunk for me and said, “There you go,” as she walked to the front, as if I couldn’t open it my damn self.   I don’t even have the key on me, mom. Will the key miraculously get locked in the truck if I touch it?  At this point, I’m starting to feel some type of way. I feel like if I can’t even go get a bottle of water, if she wants me to get something from the car for her, I’ll tell her no.  WIBTA if I tell her no, though?   tl;dr: I accidentally locked the keys in the car, and my mom was upset with me. Almost a week later, and she still doesn’t trust me to go to the car by myself to get things or wait for her. If she ever asks me to get something from the car while she’s still mad at me, I want to tell her no.\n",
      "Wife (51f) and I (49m) split up after 30 years of relationship and 23 years of marriage a few month ago.  That is another story.  I moved out and live with my oldest daughter (22) now. Works great.  My 50th birthday is coming up in december and I plan a big party, using the event to show the new home to my friends (I don't know what it's called in english, in german it's \"Einweihungsparty\")  I split in relatively good terms with my wife, which I'm glad about because of the kids.  Now to the point of my post:  I would invite her to the party, but not her boyfriend. If she won't come without him, then be it. She had a new boyfriend before we split up. As I said, another story.  So do I tell her just like it is?  \"You can come, but only without him.\" Or don't I invite her at all? She might say 'Yeah, but it's on me who I bring to the party'. Is it?  I'm not sure how to handle this, what would you do?\n",
      "Yes i know it sounds odd, small, and something i should get over but it bothers me even until now. My birthday was a few days before mothers day and during a small cookout with family my best friend came over and gave me two birthday balloons. A day or so later its late so me and my sister are finishing up the mothers day gifts we made. After a while of me painting and her failing at 6 origami flowers (she did eventually succeed) she asked if i had any leftover balloons to blow up (while ago bought balloons to mess with but it was a while ago) I said maybe and started looking, the birthday balloons were just floating to my room ceiling in the corner so she asks if she can use one. I had asked what for while still looking for a balloon in a bucket of chaos I have and she says so she can give it to our mom. I said no and how would that work anyway, she said she was going to paint over the word birthday on the happy birthday balloon and write mothers day. I once again said no, saying they were my balloons and i wanted to keep them until they deflated, she got annoyed saying it was just a balloon and once it starts deflating we were going to take the helium anyway, I again said no and she gave up and i finally found and gave her a balloon to blow up. It felt wrong to me either way reusing a balloon my friend gave to me for my own birthday. Should I have given her the balloon?\n",
      "Yesterday my husband and I visited my mother and her husband for some discussion about our current housing situation. They are currently renovating an old house with two flats.  It is also important to mention that he is currently 79 years. He has always been extremely sporty and he doesn't feel like 79. I always had the feeling that he is avoiding his age. He is someone who is avoiding conflict, there has to be a lot of anger inside him until he really says something. He usually just leaves the room if there is any discussion happening. He is also estranged from his son who is an asshole.  Yesterday we talked about renting the flat.  Here is the part where I might be TA. My husband and I are planning to have kids sooner or later. I want to give them a stable place and where we live it is  very  complicated to find a place to live. So if we move there I really want to make sure we can stay there for longer than 5 or 10 years. Now with being 79 years old 10 or 5 years can be long. This is where my pragmatism kicked in and also my job as a future mother, also I know that his family is very sundered and there is some bad blood in it, so I asked him without giving it too much thought: \"What happens with the house when you die?\"  The evening was ruined. He didn't got angry, but he couldn't really say anything. I tried to explain myself and my intention of asking this, but realizing what this could have caused in him and that the sentence was apparently very insensitive I just tried to finish the evening as good as possible. We switched the topic and then left and he seemed to be fine and even made some jokes.  Later this evening my mother called me and told me that I apparently pretty much fucked up by asking this. He misunderstood me completely by thinking that I was asking this to find out if he will inherit this house to me. He also felt that I was taking control over his decisions because he is very old anyways so he thought that I was trying to take away his remaining power over things and making decisions.  As you can see this went into the complete wrong direction of what my intention was. All I wanted to know was what is going to happen with it so we are not involved in some kind of family feud that I don't need to be a part of. I also just wanted to make sure that I am paying for something that will be of value for the people I care and won't go back to some property shark.  I am aware by now that my direct tone and my pragmatism might have hurt him and I was being insensitive.  But I grew up with family and people around me which are avoiding unpleasant things all the time. Sooner or later we are all confrontated with unpleasant topics like death, it is something absolutely unavoidable, we are all affected by it. In my opinion this is something that should be okay to talk about it. But yes, maybe in a more sensitive way.  I am going to visit him and apologize for my statement.  AITA?\n",
      "I have a new roommate in a share house. There's a few of us here, all young adults.   My new roommate wants to give music lessons to children and I said no.  I said no mainly because I am uncomfortable with having children at the house. This is a young adults share house where we all study and work. We are often home during the day, have boyfriends and girlfriend's over, have sex and so on.   It seems inappropriate to bring children into this environment.   I also have noise concerns, as the rest of us are often home during when these lessons would be, trying to study and relax.   But my main issue I don't really like kids, I don't think it's appropriate for kids to be around strange adults coming and going and I don't want kids hanging around my house.   AITA for saying no to the music lessons?\n",
      "I'll just cut to the chase here.  So my friend group and I are all going to an aircraft mechanic school and all of us except one live together.  One of them (let's call him E) thinks he's funny.  He constantly makes jokes about my weight or my looks or the fact that I'm \"smart\"(I know, stupid). I've made a point to tell him multiple times to stop doing this and he just tells me to chill out and he was just joking.  Fine.  However, today we were working in the shop and when I messed up one of my projects he told me that i should drop out and change my career.  I'd understand if i was constantly failing at everything we do but I'm a straight A student and almost always get an A on my shop projects, in fact I'm doing better than he is.  E said that i would never succeed in this job and if i continued in this field I'd end up begging on a street corner.  He did not say this like a joke, in fact his tone sounded like he was trying to do his best to insult me.  So I blew up on him and told him that if I end up homeless he'll probably be in a situation far worse, and to fuck off.  He didn't like that and got pissy for the rest of the day, and my friends are telling me I'm an asshole.  So I'm going to reddit for judgement now, AITA?\n",
      "I'm sorry for any mistakes. I'm just exhausted right now (english isn't my first)  Me and my wife have a 2 year-old-daughter. I'm a doctor. My wife's a middle-school-teacher. Unlike her. My work hours can be odd sometimes. I work during weekends and holidays no exception. Where I live the demand for working doctors is high. We're overworked and underpaid. I know this can affect my family's life as they want to spend time with me but I'm trying to do my best.  So. The situation is that my wife wanted me to stay home and watch our daughter so my wife could attend her friend's child-free-wedding. She knew I wasn't going which was fine I don't know the family well. I told her I had a shift later in the evening. She said she'd be home before the early evening. I suggested getting a family member to babysit. She told me to not worry and will arrange for her sister to come.  The day came. I was in the shower when my wife was leaving. I got out and found our daughter downstairs. I stayed with her and in 45_minutes I started calling my wife to ask if anyone will show up to watch our daughter because I needed to get ready for work. She said no one agreed to watch her so I needed to just stay with her til she come home.  I flipped out after she said she won't be home until 7. That way I was gonna miss my shift. I told her I won't wait til then and will call for a babysitter. She tried to argue with me about how overreacting I was and said I don't need a babysitter. Our daughter needs her dad to be with her. She disagreed on the babysitter. But after I argued with her I requested one right away. Once the babysitter arrived I got ready to go to work and was in mess knowing that It will be a busy night later.  I made sure everything was okay with the babysitter then left. My wife called after she came home saying she couldn't believe I brought a babysitter and that I could've used this time to do bonding activities with my daughter but I already explained I had work. She rudely asked if work was more important then hung up. Despite trying to speak to her. She thought what I did was wrong and negatively affected our daughter. She kept arguing about it like I made a mistake.  | It's worth noting that I have specific days to spend with family and get tasks done. I make sure I do my part whenever I'm home.\n",
      "Earlier this week, I twisted my ankle. It was so bad that it got casted. The doctor said not to move too much as well.  Anyway, I have to do my laundry because I'm running out of clothes to wear. Initially I thought I can do it with the help of crutches. But after I almost slipped while putting my clothes at the washing machine, I changed my mind, and asked my housemate.  However, he just laughed at me and said I can do it myself. This really upsets me because the last time, he was sick, so I did it for him since I'd rather not see him collapse from exhaustion.  Anyway, I decided to call my mom instead for help. They have automatic washing machine and a maid, so it is not a hassle for her. She asked me to have it sent to their house through Grab, but not after she asked me why can't I ask help from my roommate. Ofc, I told her that he doesn't want to, and I jokingly said that he is ungrateful because I always help him when he needs it.  Anyway, later, while I was relaxing at my room, housemate barged into my room. He is furious and called me a mama's boy. It turns out my mom called tp scold him about lacking compassion. My mom even pointed out that sometimes she also treats him dinner or lend money if he's broke, and the least that he can do for him is help me when I'm in need.   In my defense, I told him I just answered my mom's question. It is not my intention to shame him or have my mom scold him. He refused to listen to me, and he thinks I'm trying to control him.  He still won't talk to me, and it is getting awkward.  AITA?\n",
      "We have been separated for almost 6 months after 11 years together. I have been grieving the relationship hard, I'm stubborn and admitting to myself that I've failed this relationship has been difficult. Not being what makes your partner happy is a terrible feeling.  I'm also left with what I am coming to learn are pretty severe issues with my self confidence/ sense of self worth. I've talked to several therapists, however as soon as they begin talking bad about my STBXH, or explaining which of his actions contributed to my feelings or digging into what his reasoning may have been I completely check out and dont make another appointment.   I understand them asking questions, that makes total sense and I have no problem about it but I dont want to hear negative things about him. I dont want them guessing what his hormone levels or mental state was or being asked if he was a covert narcissist or to be told I was emotionally manipulated. I dont believe anything that could've had an impact was malicious, so I dont think it matters.   I just want the focus on who I am now and how to change it. I dont want to spend time placing blame on past versions of myself and people I've known, giving a one sided picture of someone I love - that feels rude.   Am I completely missing the point of therapy? Is determining other person's status/point of view that important? Am I too close to it and need to wait for therapy?   STBXH - Soon To Be Ex-Husband\n",
      "I (f21) have been dating my my bf (m22) for almost 4 years now and we're planning to get engaged so I planned a trip to introduce him to the rest of my family and he was happy too. It was 7hrs flight from where we live. I grew up in a very toxic environment and being with him has been the healthiest and happiest part of my life. We have a family house which is my grandmas and that's where we were staying and all my extended families were visiting us.  My boyfriend is a great cook and he has been cooking for my family alot. My mom, grandma, cousins and uncles love him already.  But my other aunt has been judging too much. It's not like I careabout her opinion but I've caught her side-eyeing my man, saying backhanded things in our language which he doesn't understand, she also thought he does social media as a full time job and questioned how were going to survive off cooking videos but my mother shut her up telling her what he does and asking her where she thinks the expensive gifts she received from him came from. Also my boyfriend has this habit of keeping his hand on top of my head and she literally said we have no manners for touching eachother all the time in front of elders only for that???   Yesterday he made shrimp toast as sides. Shrimps aren't a popular ingredient in our culture so it was the first for some family members trying it. While he was setting up the table I overheard her saying \"I can't believe I'll end up eating some insect a Chinese man whipped up\". My boyfriend is not Chinese he is Asian but not from China and she knows that very well. I had enough and called her out, asked why is she being so racist and say that when he was clearly trying to make dishes that would suit their palate and even asking them what ingredients they like with seafood usually and catering to everyone's diet. I told her she doesn't deserve to sit at the table with us and I'm only not taking this further for his sake, I didn't want him to notice there was something wrong going on. Later after dinner my boyfriend went to shower. My grandma gathered us sensing the tension and I told her everything my aunt said, trying to defend herself she said we kept touching eachother all time and that I was going to fail as a wife for letting him cook for my family and that her exes were more of a man then he'll ever be at that point i shouted at how insecure she must be to excuse their horrible behavior as \"manliness\" and she's just jealous her husband's were never and will never be the gentleman he is. She left the house crying and telling me I'm just trying to rub it on their faces by faking a perfect relationship.  My uncles and cousin said I should've never said that and i know might have went overboard but I couldn't hear something absolutely disgusting being said about him. He is my soul mate and I'm not going to let that slide.\n",
      "I (14M) have been moving my entire life. Since I was 6, my family has moved once every year. Sometimes house-to-house, usually state-to-state.   I have never lived in the same place for more than two years. It feels like every year and a half my life is undone and restarted worse. It’s had disastrous consequences on my mental health, and the only time I’ve gotten therapy we moved away a month into it :/  I never keep friends and the most recent move is the only time I’ve ever been able to keep in contact with people after a move. I’m a massive introvert, so making friends for me is a big accomplishment and very difficult  Most recently, my dad got a job in an area I hate.  We have family here who we stayed with during right before and during the pandemic, so we have experience here.   For a a few months, we rented a house somewhere else, and while we were there my dad got this job. I was extremely mad at them for accepting it because they knew how much I and my sister (13F) were uncomfortable and unhappy there. They told me that the only reason we were going there was to save enough money to move  away  from there. Because of this I was more okay with it, but as soon as we got down here my parents decided to try and buy a house so that we could “plant our roots.”  This is infuriating to me. My mom, sister, dad, and I  all  don’t like this area, but my parents are saying that they would rather keep us in one area until we finish high school than have to move again. Recently we had a conversation about this where I made it extremely clear that I  wanted  to move away from here and that I wouldn’t be okay with school here. They’ve been saying for years how much they don’t want me to be moved in high school, but they also said that about every grade I’ve ever been in, and we’ve moved during all of them.   What makes me the most mad is that they’ve said that this time, they would listen closely to everything we said and try to listen. Now more than ever, they said that our opinion matters. Every time I’ve brought up that I’m unhappy here, they get mad at me and say I’m not mature enough to decide what’s best for me right now.  Last night we had a conversation about it where I brought up how they said that we were coming here to leave, and they denied that ever happening. I snapped and started yelling at them, telling them that they’ve never listened to me and just moved us around without any thought towards what’s best for us. I told them that no matter what they did I would never forgive them for all of this and that they should be ashamed of it.  Honestly, I feel kinda bad about it. They’ve always mostly offered to do things I wanted, they’ve tried to make sure I had what I was interested in, and are nice a lot. But at the same time, I don’t think it’s at all acceptable that they keep moving and I can’t take any more of it. We were affected by COVID like a lot of people, but it was hardly the first time and I don’t think it will be the last. So tell me, AITA?  ETA: My sister also really hates where we are.\n",
      "First of all, English isnt my native language so, sorry for any mistakes  So, me, my grandma and my mom recently went to stay with my mom's aunt (my grandma's late husband's sister) because she felt lonely because of this whole Covid 19 situation. She is 92 years old.   And after spending 5 days with her, I was reminded why I didnt really like spending time with her. Because she judges everyone. I showed her a picture that I had taken of my friend, and she said  \"Oh she used to be prettier. She must have gained weight, she used look better\" (my friend is not overweight at all anf she didnt even gain a visible amount of weight and her health is no way at risk and she is truly a pretty girl) Then I showed her a pic of my cats and she said they looked \"ugly\" and \"devilish\" which also irritated me.   She also said that a researcher that was talking about the problems that gen z face was stupid because the researcher did not have a microphone, so  her audio was not clear. She also said my mom's job wasn't a \"real job\". My mom is a life coach that helps students that are about to go to university.   She also said that my manners were bad because I usually get up and put my dishes in the kitchen right after I finish my meal and I dont stick around to have a conversation with the rest of them but the usual conversations they have so not interest me at all and are usually about stuff or people I dont know about.  She said this to my mom, right in front of me. I tried to explain to her why I dont stick around after finishing my meal and she just cut me off before I could explain.   She calls people on television \"ugly\" just because they have short legs or they are not conventionally pretty or they have tattoos. My mom says that I should just ignore it, that it is too late to change her mindset, and that she was probably judged so much when she was younger and that is why she is like this. And I am not a confrontational person but sometimes it bothers me way too much that I need to say something and then my mom's aunt gets upset.   AITA for getting irritated and annoyed at my mom's aunt?\n",
      "I know it sounds wierd but yea  So I had these headphones that I got for my birthday 2 years ago and they started acting wierd a few days ago so is asked someone and they told me they were dying so I was really sad the other day they died and I started crying and my sister was in the other room listening to music and she heard me and she knew about the headphones but instead of comforting me she came and told me to shut up I just got up and shut the door then about 2 seconds later she came in picked them up and full on threw them out the window I just shouted and told her to go away and leave me  Also these were a gift from my now dead dad  So guys AITA\n",
      "I (21F) have a brother, Sean (23M), who recently got married to Cassandra (21F) after dating for just under a year. I am happy for them, but there’s one problem. Prior to dating Cassandra, Sean had been in a relationship with my best friend Hannah (F22) since high school. They have twins, Jessie and Brooke (MF5). They broke up after infidelity from Sean.  Soon after they broke up, Sean met Cassandra through me, as she was part of my cheer team at the college we attended. We weren’t close, but I threw a party after our school homecoming and Sean was there.  Hannah was heartbroken after hearing that he moved on, as she still had feelings for him despite the heartache he caused her. She made plans to sabotage their relationship by befriending Cassandra just so she could tell her how toxic my brother was. (In fairness most of these things were true)  She would make up hang out as a group and then get drunk as a way to explain her rambling about the relationship. Cassandra soon got tired of this and cut Hannah out.  Sean proposed two months ago and Cassandra asked me to be a bridesmaid, I accepted but stepped down after being bombarded with text from Hannah on how selfish I’m being. I felt awful for Cassandra since she’s been nothing but sweet to me, but I felt the need to protect my friendship with Hannah.  At the last minute Cassandra’s MOH got incredibly sick so she asked me to take the place of the bridesmaid who was going to replace the MOH. I said yes and when Hannah found out she was furious, she yelled at me in my own home and than she said if i  participate in the wedding our friendship is over. I told her that I already made a commitment and I’m not gonna abandon that because she’s bitter. She stormed out and we haven’t spoken since   I have been best friends with Hannah since I was 4, I don’t want to throw away our friendship but AITA?\n",
      "Pretty much the title. My son is sixteen and he has depression. He has biweekly therapy and is on medication, but like all people with depression, sometimes it gets bad. I try and help him as much as possible, but I'm also working over fifty hours a week and I can't keep on top of the house all the time.   We have pretty good communication so when he is having a bad week he doesn't do all his chores - just basic ones. Keep your clothes in your hamper, bring them down every three days, wash your own dishes, etc. It works relatively well.  Recently I was on facetime with my cousin and he slumbered down to do his dishes that had accumulated, and was obviously looking very unhappy while he did them. My cousin asked why he looked so pissed, and I explained that depression was just kicking his ass.   She got affronted and acted like I was the worst mother in the world. I tried explaining that I could not do all his chores for him with how much I work, (my other two children have had to move in with their dad because of how much I work. It's a lot) but she still thinks I need to work around it.   I don't know how, but if all of you guys think I'm the asshole too I will try to find a way. So, am I the asshole?\n",
      "This happened a few weeks ago but the situation was brought up again recently.  I (28M) have a son, Nathan (6M). I'm his sole parent because his mother lost the custody battle.   His school was made aware of this when I removed his mother's details from their system and his current teacher for grade one has not met my ex. Due to the nature of the custody battle, his teacher does know about my ex for safety reasons as she has been barred from coming to the school to get him. Basically, she knows that if she ever sees me with a woman, it is definitely  not  my ex.  His school has parent teacher meetings twice a year, once before the Christmas break and another at the end of the academic year.   I've been dating my girlfriend, Venus (24F) for the past eight months and she has an amazing relationship with my son. He likes her a lot and he asked me if she could come with me to the parent teacher conference because he wanted her to hear that he's doing well at school. My son used to struggle with English as his mother tongue is Spanish. My Spanish is okay but Venus is fluent, so she helped him improve his English speaking by tutoring him.   At the meeting, I noticed that the teacher was only speaking to Venus. She was making eye contact with her and only directing conversations to her. I found this annoying because although I know most primary parents are women, the teacher is well aware that I'm Nathan's sole parent. Venus kept redirecting the conversation to me and I did ask a few questions but the teacher would speak to me for a few seconds, and then go back to speaking to Venus only. Eventually, I said 'im sorry to interrupt you but I'm Nathan's father and I'd appreciate it if you spoke to me'.   The teacher seemed taken back and irritated but she apologized and spoke to me for the rest of the meeting.  I told my brother in law (sister's husband) about what happened and he thinks I overreacted. He said that while he does find it annoying when teacher only speak to my sister at meetings, he understands that it's not out of malice and just a force of habit since mothers tend to be more involved than fathers. He also said it was my fault for bringing Venus along to the meeting. He thinks it was an asshole move for me to interrupt the teacher and make her feel like she did something wrong for something that was most likely not malicious.  It was brought up again at Christmas because Venus spent it with my family and my mother asked Venus if she had Nathan's inhaler and my BIL interrupted and said 'Careful, (my mom's name), Mark (me) might freak now'.   I would like to put this situation to rest. AITA?  Edit: I did tell the teacher that Venus was my girlfriend as soon as we sat down.\n",
      "I (M14) live in a household of four, with my brother (M11), dad (M38), and mom (F38). My dad has always been that “Type A” parent that pressures me to get straight A’s, participate in multiple sports and extracurricular activities, and punishes me by taking things away (for example, my phone or ability to play video games) if I don’t.   So ever since this pandemic started and lockdown was implemented, my dad came up with a schedule. So I sat down with him for a while and we agreed upon a schedule that detailed my studying for a few hours for my upcoming AP test, going on a run specified by my high school’s track team, practicing basketball for an hour, and various other tasks. In return, I was allowed to have a solid few hours to play video games or otherwise have free time. As this lockdown went on, however, my dad kept deciding that it wasn’t enough. So, things progressively got harder and harder for me, increasing the requirements and decreasing the reward.   It came to a head today when he decided that every hour that I spent on screens for recreational purposes had to have an hour spent outside to compensate. Now this is on top of a total of 3 hours of studying (PSATs, next year’s classes, etc), a daily run on the weekdays determined by my cross country team’s schedule, going to the gym for an hour or two every weekday, and doing chores around the house. All of this, in exchange for a maximum of two hours that I can spend recreationally on my screens. I told him that was ridiculous and that, at that point, I would rather just forgo any of that work and not play any video games. In response to that, he said if I did not complete those requirements, not only would I be unable to play video games, but he would start taking more things away (for example, my phone). I told him that this request was unreasonable, and that I was already doing more than most any other teenager my age did during a break from school many times over. He then goes that he isn’t “every dad”. I think it’s a bullshit argument but that this point I’m scared to argue further in fear of him taking more away from me. Then when I’m not all happy go lucky the rest of the night, my dad calls me “an entitled jackass” for ruining the night for the family. So Reddit, AITA? To me I really don’t see how my dad thinks he is in the right, but then again it might just by I’m too young to see the situation for what it is.\n",
      "This is fucking weird. I am 18f and my brother is 16. He is way too into with lesbians. It is creepy. He watches many many lesbian youtubers. He watches a lot of shows with lesbians. He also reads a ton of lesbian romances. He lend me his kindle and yeah, it was  chock full of mature lesbian romances. I don't understand it at all. He has friends who are part of the LGBTQ community so I think he probably understands that it is very creepy for straight men to be into lesbians. It is weird because he is sweet and very respectable. This is weird but he also wrote a very sweet lesbian lover story. It was very cute but yeah he has a ton of interest in lesbians which I don't understand at all.   I talked to him about it. I told him that it was a bit creepy that he was so interested in lesbians and if he had any notion of a lesbian falling in love him or converting one then he was being a huge creep. He mumbled something but looked incredibly upset. He has been a bit withdrawn for a few days and Mom asked me what is going on with him.   I told her about this and mom was angry with me, she called me Idiot in a harsh tone (she rarely looses her temper) when I told her that and she said to let him be and not to talk to him about this ever. She also kept on talking about everyone in the house coming in her way when she was trying to do something good. I feel like I missed something here, My brother is still very upset and my mom still stares at me after time he is withdrawn or not participating in any conversations. I feel guilty as hell for this, I tried to do the right thing but I feel like I have fucked up here. I feel like I am missing something here and I thought my mom would be on my side on this and that she isn't say a lot.\n",
      "Background: I am a 16 year old Japanese male who was adopted by Korean parents and currently living in the US. I didn’t know that I was Japanese by blood and that I was adopted until 2 years ago when my parents revealed it to me. It came off as a huge surprise to me. I wanted to learn more about me being adopted like who my blood parents are. However, they said that they will tell me when I am older. I concluded that there was no use disputing their decision and that for the time being, I should be grateful that I was adopted in the first place.  Situation: During history class on Wednesday, one of my classmates said out loud to the class how I was Japanese (in a non racist way) because I identified as Japanese. Then, on Thursday during lunch, I was having a rough day at that point and I was trying to knock out some of my physics homework. I was working in a room where high schoolers can sit/work during lunch, but there was no teacher. A girl from history class went up to me and said that I’m not Japanese because my name is not Japanese at all. My name not being Japanese is true because my adoptive parents gave me an American first name and their Korean last name. However, I didn’t want to talk about my background to her given that it was a sensitive topic, I was in a bad mood, and I wanted to work on homework. I responded with “That is personal matter and I would appreciate it if we do not talk about it at the moment.”  The girl kept prying me for the information, but I kept asking her to please give me some space. Then, she repeatedly called me a Korean (while putting excessive emphasis when she said the word “Korean” so that it comes off as mocking) and said that “I don’t look Japanese.” I tried to ignore her at that point and focus on my work, but she wouldn’t stop. Eventually, I lost all my patience and angrily put my physics work in my backpack. I left the room and said out loud “I am not putting up with your racist bullcrap, [girl’s name].” (Remember that there was no teacher in this room).  Apparently, some of the students who were in that room accused the girl of being a racist because of what I said. From hindsight, I realized that what she said was attacking my racial identification instead of a race, but I realized that saying “You are racist” probably had a greater effect than if I were to have said “You are harassing me.”  Overall, I felt unnecessarily bothered with her constant poking at a topic that is quite sensitive to me when I asked her to stop. However, I think that I may have been using my rough mood as an excuse to chastise her when I said, “I am not putting up with your racist bullcrap, [girl’s name].” So AITA?\n",
      "Mobile, English is not my first language, you guys know the drill lol  Basically the title is the story but here are the details:  Last year my fiancé (fiancée?) and I moved in together and decided it would be nice to merge our families for our first holiday in our new home. We invited my parents + grandparents and his parts + 1 cousin. BTW both of us are in our early 20s so this was my first time ever hosting anything important; I made all of the appetizers, desserts, and the main dish (my mom helped when she got here but I basically had everything prepped and ready to go by then).   My mom actually brought these larger disposable thanksgiving plates and asked if I wanted to use those for the food.  I was like, “they’re cute, why not!?”. So we serve the food in those plates but we bring out the fancy glasses for wine and of course regular silverware to eat with.   Food was great and everything was going pretty well until my father-in-law said, “hey, yamyams, thanks for having us everything is really good but there’s one thing I didn’t like... I don’t like that you served us on these plastic/disposable plates.” The table went quiet and I felt my face turning RED. I wanted to play it off with a laugh but then I hear MY DAD say “yeah, I personally don’t like using plastic plates but I didn’t wanna say anything.” (This is true, he has never liked eating on plastic plates but usually only makes a fuss about it in his own home).  So at this point my grandpa chips in that he doesn’t think it’s big deal at all since there’s like 10 people at the table and I was the one who cooked everything. But then everyone now has something to say about these plates.  Then my FIL starts going on about how “the Italians put family over everything and they put their finest out for each other as a sign of respect, and that this was just a heads up for “next year”, and blablabla” ( I literally blacked out from humiliation at this point so I’m not sure what else he said). Also, WE ARENT EVEN ITALIAN! We’re Hispanic!!!   So for a while I felt really embarrassed and thought that I was TA for this, but I also feel confused and thought it was normal because when I was growing up thanksgiving was a GIANT family event with like 50+ people so I’m pretty sure we’ve always used plastic plates for that reason. Plus, the plates that I used weren’t those white BBQ plates, they were cute!! They said “thankful” and had cute fall leaves on them, and were not even flimsy at all!!!!   But my in laws are very fancy and have always had “grand” thanksgiving dinners with assigned seating and a bunch of glass plates for each course and stuff. That is why i thought I may be TA, because i didn’t put as much effort or took the lazy way out as to not wash any extra dishes? So it made me feel kind of sad and embarrassed with my dinner....   Anyway, this has been brought up a few times since, and because of the holidays coming up I’m getting war flashback from this incident. I’m kidding; it’s funny now, I can laugh about it! but still, I just to know AITA??   EDIT   My fiancée tried to stand up for me by throwing my mom under the bus lol. He said “her mom was the one brought them” and my mom said “yeah, I thought the plates were cute and fine to use??” And that’s when everyone else started talking about the plates and whether or not they cared. THEN FIL went on with his speech\n",
      "So this happened like 10 minutes ago.  I was playing a game called \"Dead by Daylight\". During the game that lasts around 10 minutes, my friend sent me a few messages on skype and since I wasn't replaying for a few seconds, he decided to call me. Once he called me, my whole game stopped for about 5 seconds and I lost sound for about 20 seconds. Now keep in mind that in this game every second counts, and without sound you're 60% useless. Now, there was no way he could've known I was in the game and it was my mistake that I didn't put \"do not disturb\" status. So I dedicate a few more seconds to send him a message \"don't call\", after which he replied \"I am not calling\".... and after 5 seconds - he calls again. Now after that I admit I lost my shit and I wrote him \"go fuck yourself\". He wrote \"don't whine\" after that, to which I replied something along the lines of \"fuck off\" (can't really translate the word from our language). Few minutes later he says that that reaction was way out of the line for \"just a game\" and he no longer wants to talk to me.   I understand I overreacted, but I apologized to him and told him I was frustrated, but he doesn't want to respond.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: Friend called me and after I told him not to call, he called me again which ruined my game. Told him to fuck himself, later I apologized but he refuses to talk to me.  So... AITA?\n",
      "I [23F] was driving with my sister [19F] in shotgun and my brother [25M] in the back, and we had had the radio on. Everybody seemed to be enjoying themselves, until my sister started singing along very loudly and very offkey. I wasn't going to say anything, until I spotted my brother in the rearview mirror wincing and putting his earbuds in - so i asked my sister to please stop singing. She yelled at me for ordering her around. AITA?\n",
      "Hey guys,   I started working when I was in highschool and at the time I was saving up for post secondary. I had saved roughly 5k. My dad needed the money so I lent it to him. He eventually payed me back after I started post secondary. A few years later, I've been working full time. It's not a high paying job. Minimum at best. And I'm not bringing in much. They decided to buy a house roughly 5 years ago, and I was against it at the time. Since then my siblings and I have been paying majority of the bills.  I mostly pay the groceries and give my parents 100-150/m, because I need to pay off my College debt. I have also payed the mortgage before, and 2 other phone bills aside from mine. I haven't been paid for these yet. I think it's a lost cause...  Whenever my mom and I fight, she tends to ignore me for weeks at a time. Recently we fought over something minor, and she basically called me; selfish, greedy, and money hungry. Then went off on a whole tangent of why I'm not a good person, and I don't help with anything, and sit on my money ( figure of speech; I'm making money to save it). She then proceeded to say that because I'm not physically buying food they i don't deserve to eat it. She stopped cooking for me, and has been really petty about food since. Ex: if she cooks she makes sure there is none left for me. Other times she will put meat in the food, knowing full well, I don't eat meat.  This is the 3rd time this year where she has stopped talking to me and has been utterly disrespectful towards me.   Am I the asshole for saving whatever I can to pay off my debts and not helping more?\n",
      "I'm a pretty big guy and spend a lot of time in the gym, my friends often call me the BFG because I'm rather docile and slow to anger. In my social group I'm sort of a drunk performing bear. I lift people above my head, twirl them around, balance them on my shoulders and do other tricks.  For me it's all in good fun and I often have to grab people to lift them, but I always check with them where it's ok to grab them or touch them.  We were in the park last week and another guy tried lifting people up, it ended with everyone collapsing in laughter. Everyone seemed to have fun and we all jokes around. He was being rather handsy with one girl, but she seemed ok with it and I saw no uncomfortableness.  A week later he's been kicked out of the group. Why? The girl's BF wasn't happy and she then complained that the guy tried to grab her body against her consent, which didn't happen. Since then I've refused to touch anyone and I say \"Don't know when you'll change your mind, don't want to risk getting kicked out\"  Now I'm told I'm being an arsehole and I'm no longer fun because I'm overreacting.\n",
      "Krispy Kreme had a promotion on Friday the 13th. You get two dozen donuts for $13. One of the dozen is their plain glazed donuts and the other is a dozen of the specialty donuts. This Krispy Kreme closes at 8pm and stops taking online orders at 7:30pm.  I arrived there at 7:12pm. Went into the store and waited on line until it was my turn to order. I told them i want the special promotion for today. They said i need a barcode that would be emailed to me. I asked how to get it emailed to me and they said, to download the app, sign up for an account, and the barcode would be sent to my email. I did that and waited. I kept waiting and no email ever came. eventually i found an email with a promotion for a free donut. apparently that's what gets sent to your email when you make an account. I told the person at the register who told me how to get the promotion that i had yet to get the specific email. I did however find that i could use the app to get the promotion. I showed them and he said they stop taking online orders at 7:30pm. It was 7:32pm. At that point i was pissed and asked if there was a way to just let me buy the donuts as this was taking way too long. He said there was not. I asked if there was a manager i could speak with that might be able to handle this issue. He walked over and told the manager i wanted to speak with them.  maybe 10 minutes later, the manager came over to me and asked what the issue was. I explained that i just wanted to get the promotion for two dozen donuts. they said without the barcode, its impossible to give me that deal. I said that i did everything that was told to me in order to get the barcode and showed them my phone with the promo deal in my cart. They said that i should have signed up a week ago as that's when they start sending out the email for that promotion. i explained that i had no idea this was a promotion a week ago and only found out this morning. They said that even if i had the bar code, i wouldn't be able to get the deal because they ran out of the plain glazed donuts. i then said that i don't care about those dozen donuts as all i really want is the other dozen of specialty donuts. she said it was impossible to get one without the other. i told her I'm willing to pay the full $13 and forgo the dozen plain glazed donuts, as all i want to do is buy the donuts and leave. She said that's impossible. I looked behind her and saw that they had roughly 300 donuts in the back. I said that since they are closing in 15 minutes, they wont possibly be able to sell those donuts and all i want is to give them money for donuts. She said \"UGH FINE WHAT DO YOU WANT?\". I told her what i wanted and she handed me the box of donuts and i got on line to pay. As i was standing there waiting to pay she yelled at me to leave. I looked at her in confusion, as i hadn't paid yet. she told me to leave again so i started walking away with the donuts. as I'm leaving she yells at me: \"NEVER AGAIN WILL THIS HAPPEN\"  So Reddit, AITA?\n",
      "This took a whole semester to unfold, so I’m sorry if it’s long. I tried to keep it simple, but as detailed as possible:  The theatre organization I joined as a freshman worked on productions, so they did make it clear from the get-go how much they need the members' serious commitments. They told me that we could be asked to stay very late to finish work. I supposed that I'll figure it out as time passes, so I accepted my role and joined. I'm sure I can make a few sacrifices if need be, as I'm already used to staying up late for band rehearsals.  On the first meeting, they walk us through things, including the org’s policy wherein if a member of the team missed too many meetings without good reason, that member would have to pay money to compensate for the lack of help. They asked us to sign a waiver of commitment by the end of the first meeting. Everything sounded fair, so I already signed. They didn't immediately collect the waivers as they were pressed for time, and they're giving us time to decide on making our commitments. I wasn’t able to hand mine in asap. I admit that I did intentionally keep it since they allowed us to make our minds first. I planned to hand it in when our leader actually asked for it (she didn’t).  They (the freshie who’s supposed to be Manager, plus the leader) tried to coordinate everyone’s scheds to come up with meeting times. I just couldn’t fit in their schedule somehow. I’ve attended a couple of meetings, but not much was done while I was around. Time was spent looking for a place to hold it, since most the meetings they’d call were in less than two days’ notice, or sometimes, just the night before the time they’re setting it at, and venue was usually “to be announced”. So I’d miss almost all of them either cus I’d already set something else (like band practice) or because the meeting time is literally during my classes. I tell them I can’t go and why, and I assume that they’d understand.  Additionally, they change set times at a whim, not minding that the others would be pressured to cope. They even changed the policy, and I only heard of it when they eventually started asking me to pay up for missing so many meetings. I say I can’t pay because I’m really trying to contribute, but the sched just says no. They come at me telling me I should be making some more sacrifices, like them, but I say I can’t possibly sacrifice my academics for the org. They’re pinning me as the one unprofessional for committing to something else other than the org, and for saying that I can’t cancel the appointments I already made when they announce their meetings.  The kicker at the end of the whole thing was the fact that I haven’t even submitted the waiver of commitment, which means I’m not bound by letter to them and their policies yet.  We already agreed to just let me go without paying, but…  Am I really the unprofessional one here, like they claimed me to be? Or was I lucky that the waiver served as my trump card to get out there?\n",
      "I’m currently in uni and drowning in assignments. I had work yesterday and found out late that my bus wasn’t coming because of road works. I tried to get a cab but all unavailable. I found one that was due in 30 min so I booked it. During this time I was at my boyfriends house and he he knew I was stressed because I told him. He was trying to help my situation but I was becoming increasingly stressed because if I was late to work, I would need to have stayed longer which I don’t have time for because of my assignments.   I’m upstairs by myself crying to alleviate the stress and I’ve told my boyfriend I want space. 30 minutes pass and the cab isn’t there or dispatched so I rang the company. During this time my boyfriend wasn’t in the house he had gone. He says the wait is an hour, and I was frustrated. He was being rude and dismissive on the phone so I just cut the phone and decided to wait. I go back into the app and the company have cancelled my cab. I now have no way of getting to work, it’s 6:00 (the time my shift started). I’m getting more and more stressed so I ring back and ask him why the cab was cancelled. He explained that he was in charge and it was up to him whether or not I got a cab. Conversation spiralled and we began shouting on the phone. He was EXTREMELY RUDE. My boyfriend still isn’t here. Towards the end he said he’s going to block my phone number and so I told him to fuck off and cut. At this point my boyfriend IS here and heard the last part of the conversation. The last part he heard was me screaming at this guy on the phone telling him to Fuck off, out of context. I hear him downstairs telling his mate that I shouldn’t speak to people like that and I shouldn’t take my anger out on people. But that’s not what happened. I wasn’t taking my anger out on the guy I was defending myself against a power tripping asshole.   My boyfriend then says that I’m wrong in this situation regardless of what happened and regardless of what he said to me. Basically didn’t want to hear what had happened he was just telling me I was wrong. We went back and forth and then we actually started arguing full force. He was blaming me for what happened based on what he heard in the last 2 seconds of the phone call without having any prior knowledge of the situation or actually knowing what’s going on.   I told him I feel as though he’s being an ass because he’s dismissing me before knowing what went down. He’s saying that it doesn’t matter because he doesn’t want a girlfriend who speaks to people like that.. but does the context of the not matter at all? He wants me to admit I was completely wrong and the entire situation from the phone call to us arguing is my fault. Im happy to admit fault but he’s also at fault no? AITA for telling my boyfriend he’s an ass for not considering the full context of the situation and blaming me?\n",
      "I found 2 kittens stranded in the middle of a 4 lane high way , by the time I saw em I was going too fast to stop and get them and their position was too dangerous for me to go in . So I go call the city’s animal control . They leave me on hold for A WHOLE HOUR with the automated messaging system saying all their representatives were busy ( they weren’t , I called exactly when it said they opened online ) and by the time they finally get to me they redirect me to another city’s animal services because the kittens were almost at the border to another city . That city’s animal services were closed for the week . I call right back to request a rescue again and they say it’s not their problem . I get mad and tell them their services are a sham . What kind of animal control takes this long to pick up ? Would they expect someone getting attacked by a dog or something to fend it off for an hour before anyone can help ? The lady on the line tried to say something but I hung up after I finished yelling at them . My parents who over heard me asked what was wrong with me and I shouldn’t yell at people like that .   I might be the a hole because the people working there are still … people , but public services like these need to be held at a higher standard .\n",
      "Throwaway account because my main one is too obvious.   Okay so today I was at work, just like any other normal day. Our office has a reception waiting area and a bathroom directly across it. The bathroom is usually used by the female employees but it isn’t labelled and we wouldn’t object to anyone else using it.   I headed up to use the bathroom and knocked before going in. The handle went down smoothly and I opened the door a crack, before pausing to chat with the receptionist. As our conversation continued, I leant into the door, gradually exposing more and more of the bathroom.   Eventually I turned to head in and got so legitimately frightened to see a well-dressed gentleman sitting on the toilet, just staring back at me. His pants were around his ankles and a horrible odor quickly emerged from the bathroom. The other guests at reception could now see him. I apologised frantically and quickly shut the door. The man didn’t make a single noise and gave no indication of him being in the bathroom, from me knocking to me opening the door. I was informed later on he reported the incident and now HR will be questioning me in the next few hours. I found out from the receptionist that he is a high-end client of ours and the incident made him extremely furious. He requested HR to fire me and stated I was irresponsible for opening the door like that without checking. He’s extremely wealthy and well respected in the office, my company would do anything to please him so now I am questioning if I really deserve to potentially get fired for embarrassing him like that.   Reddit, AITA?  Edit - thank you to everyone who was super supportive! To answer the question - the door does indeed lock, in fact, it has a twisty lock on the handle and then a bolt slightly higher up!  HR have agreed to not fire me but I have to write an apology letter to this client.\n",
      "So I have a close friend of 4 years. We’ll call her Rachel. Rachel is good at making friends but extremely two faced, always complaining about someone. She has a hard time getting into friend groups because of that. I’ve introduced her to two friend groups I was in. We had a good time, everything was fine, and then the friend group (in both situations) made me uncomfortable or a certain person used me for sexual things and then left. I would then leave those groups for the sake of my mental health, but she would still mention them and say how much fun they’re having and how close they’ve gotten. I kept it to myself for 2 years but tonight I broke and said If she’s gonna stay friends with people who have hurt me and have caused me a lot of mental pain and they know it, then I can’t talk to her for awhile and all she said was “I understand.” AITA for getting upset/mad at her for staying around the people she knows have hurt me and staying friends with them even though I know she has no obligation to leave friends for me?\n",
      "Am queer, 20 years old. I live in a completely different area from anyone in my family, and really only see any given family member a couple of times a year. Like the last time I saw a member of my family was mid-July when I moved the last of my stuff out of my uncle’s house, where I’d lived in high school. I’m not on bad terms with any of them, but we’ve never been super close and I don’t generally share many things about my life with them. I’ll text my aunt & uncle every couple of weeks and check in on each other, a sister might FaceTime me every once in a while, and my grandma loves to send my thinly veiled racist memes on Facebook messenger. So I’ll keep them posted on how I’m doing in school, how I’m liking my job, and what’s going on with my cats, but they don’t generally know much about my personal life, and it seems that everyone is content with that.   I hate my legal name. I’ve hated it since I was a kid. It’s an ugly old lady name and it doesn’t fit me at all. Since I was in high school and started presenting as more androgynous, I’ve been using my last name, which is also a generally male first name—think Taylor, Ryan, Bailey, etc. Since I don’t wanna be like Phillip Phillips, I tend to use a different but similar last name to my legal name.   I’m always uncomfortable when my legal name pops up, which is pretty frequently.  It’s the name on all of my school documents, it’s the name on my driver’s license, my debit cards, my bills and bank statements. I hate it. I hate looking at it. I hate writing it. I hate explaining the situation with my name. I’m tired of it.   I’ve always planned to change my name, but every passing day gets more and more annoying and I’m at the point where I just want to get it over with.   The only thing stopping me is that I don’t know how my family would react. They know that I’m queer—in their minds, I’m a lesbian who wears boy clothes—and while they’re definitely not crazy about it, they don’t care too much. Mostly we just don’t talk about it. But they are good Midwesterners and they like to adhere to tradition and not ruffle feathers. WIBTA if I just changed my name and never told them? Or at least didn’t tell them for a long time?\n",
      "I am 26F and my mother 62F aren't very close but we are the only family left in the town we live in (We live on an island). I have been basically living with my boyfriend (6 days a week) the last year and still paying my mom rent and stopping by to stay the night once a week and spend time with her. Being around her has increasingly gotten difficult for me to due to my moms extreme political and personal beliefs that are completely opposite to mine. My sisters live in the mainland (my sisters are sorta estranged and barely speak to either me or my mom), my mother is not married, my grandparents have passed & my mom has a few friends she spends time with weekly.  My current issue is that my boyfriend wants me to spend time with his family for holidays (his family loves traveling & live part time in Texas and here). My mother gets very upset and guilt trips me about things, i.e I left for Christmas last year to go to Vegas for the first time I was so excited but my mom would just call me and cry & text me to never speak to her again. I understand my mom is lonely but I don't know how I am supposed to be my own person and grow up without upsetting her. I even offered to make a big dinner the day before I leave and she denied it (I offered the same during Christmas and was denied). I mentioned wanting to go visit his family in Texas this Thanksgiving and she said \"Oh you're ditching me again?\". My anxiety has been a lot better since limiting contact with my mom but I just feel really bad for leaving her behind still.  I am genuinely always concerned with my mom making friends and she has a lot of nice friends at the gym. I encourage her to maybe go visit her best friend when I go away so she can feel less lonely but she denies. I just don't know what more to do besides just sucking it up and staying home just for the sake of not hurting her feelings.   WIBTA for going to Texas for Thanksgiving and leaving my mom at home?\n",
      "I switched shifts to accommodate ongoing medical appointments, from 9am to 530am.  When I started coming in early, I noticed that my coworkers would lounge around in the break room, sleep on the couch, or sleep in their car.  No work was being done between the hours of 05:30 and 07:30, though they were getting paid for that time.  It is not as if there wasn't anything to do, just that there was no direction or supervision.  Mind you, all of this behavior is on camera.  It bothers me when people are being paid the same as I am, and I am the only one working, while they relax.  Edit\\   This is par for the course here in California at this job, I will be working while they watch movies on their phones.  I never reported up the CoC for this as they were locatable.  The important part is that they are on the warehouse floor, only a shout away if shit goes sideways.   When they are sleeping on the job, that is my limit of tolerance.  It creates a safety issue when I need help, if I can't find them.  Or I yell and no one comes, as was the case last year when the entire building almost went up in flames.  I got the fire out by the time my coworker came from wherever the hell he was.  One of the supervisors was actively participating in scamming the company, I went up the chain of command and reported the problem, but nothing was done, besides vaguely asking the workers to get off their phones.  Edit/  I told HR about the issue, and the early shift was removed and we switched back to the time clock.  Since then all my coworkers give me the silent treatment.  When I sit down in the break room for lunch, everyone gets up and leaves. They stare at me with a disgruntled look when I wish them good morning cheerfully every day. Yesterday, I think one of them yelled, \"Don't be a snitch.\"\n",
      "I live in a large house on a sidewalked street with public parking with 3 other adults. Each of us owns a car. Our house has a driveway that is long but barely wide enough for 1 car with hard barriers on either side (the house and a retaining wall) and the yard is raised up and can't be parked in, so we park one car in the driveway and the others on the street, usually two in front of my house and one in front of one of the two houses across the street. Sometimes the neighbors on either side of us take one of the spots in front of my house and we park 2 cars across the street. My neighbors have started complaining about us parking there, which came to a head in a screaming match between my wife and one of the neighbors this morning. The thing is, both houses have driveways large enough to accomodate all of the houses' cars, and one of them is on a corner and has a whole other street to park on that nobody else uses. They never use either of those spots if they're left empty. They just don't want to look at our cars being parked there. I think it's ridiculous to leave parking spots that we need on a public parking street open just because they don't like my cars being there. I know that legally I'm right, but AITA?\n",
      "My aunt lives in another state but comes back to visit once or twice a year. We aren’t the closest, but she did let me stay at her place for a few months when I worked a temp job, so we do talk and go out when she’s here. My brother visited her house back a couple months ago and during that time they talked about going to a baseball game when she visits in August. Awhile after my brother came back I heard about the game from my grandma in passing. I casually commented that I wondered why I wasn’t invited, but that was it. I truly did not expect nor demand an invite. Today my aunt calls me to chat and started talking about the game. She told me her reasoning for not inviting me was that “I probably wouldn’t be able to get off of work” and that I “probably wouldn’t be able to find a place to have my dogs stay.” This actually would have been very easy for me, especially if she had mentioned it when she did to my brother a couple months ago. Again I didn’t expect an invite but I found it odd that she would tell me all the reasons that she didn’t think I could go. If she didn’t want me to go, she could have just said that. I cut to the chase and asked her “auntie, are you inviting me to this game or not?” She then said “no I am not” and proceeded to laugh. I got pretty angry and ended the call. AITA for being upset about this?  Edit: thank you everyone for your input.\n",
      "So my I'm engaged right now. And my soon to be brother in law who is 18 has wrecked 1 car(his fault speeding around a corner and hit a tree) and has 2 speeding tickets. I just bought my fiance a '16 VW Golf. I told my fiance and her brother that he is not allowed to drive the car because I don't want anything to happen it. He flipped out and threw a tantrum(as he is known to do because he is coddled) and my fiance got angry with me saying it isn't fair to him if he doesn't have a car to drive because their parents won't buy him a new one(again coddled always gets what he wants but I won't budge) AITA?\n",
      "I (25M) have no problem lending money to friends when they need, knowing they're capable of paying me back.  My best friend (22F) isn't in the greatest financial situation, lives with either of her separated parents, her Dad lost his job, she's a full time student with no car or job. She wouldn't ask me to borrow money if she didn't ask her parents first. She needed money for tuition (an amount I can lose) and I happily said yes.  Two weeks go by and she needs money to pay her credit card bill ($~100 of food expenses only). This time I felt as if this could be a monthly occurrence of her needing money every month. I asked if she had a long term plan. If needs to eat, I'll happily get her food, but I feel like most of the blame is on her parents.  Long story short, she got mad at me for saying no and has been ignoring my calls and texts. I'm just sad she'd end our friendship over this. She's a good person in a bad situation.  Would I be an asshole if I ask for the tuition money back even though I know she won't be able to repay me anytime soon? I usually am petty; would I be the asshole if I contact my bank and said \"I didn't authorize that payment\"?  &#x200B;  EDIT: Thank you for the wisdom, I appreciate aspects I didn't foresee. I will not even consider contacting my bank. I can only have hope since she hasn't blocked me yet (she would've blocked me in a heartbeat if she really wanted to run off with the money). I feel like she still cares somewhat.\n",
      "About a few months back in 2020, I was friends with someone on the PlayStation 4. We became friends in a WWE 2K20 league, which is just where we can play against others. Some people were being jerks to me, so my friend stepped in, and they went after him. He then started saying that he was feeling depressed because of them. I immediately gave him my support, and he seemed happy. But some things didn't seem right. He was making Thanos snap references, and out of the blue, told me, during the same conversation that \"Omg, my dad just died\", like he was just told. So I started getting suspicious that he was lying about being depressed, and didn't let him join any of my leagues because of it. As it turns out, I was right, as he told me a while later. I have tried to not speak to him again, but one time, he told me that he felt awful about that, but I don't think I believe him.  So now, I might as well do the logical thing here. Go on the internet and ask total strangers what their opinion of the situation is. So Reddit, AITA?\n",
      "Let me start off by saying my mother is not a stupid woman. She is very smart, graduated at the top of her class, so it blows my mind when she does stupid things like this. She acts foolish when it comes to technology. She cannot download an app or print from her computer. However she works crazy machines for her job, which is a lot harder than “file print” and she’ll tell me to print something for her because she “doesn’t know how” or “doesn’t get it.” Blows my mind.  For some reason she has resorted to believing that the RING app is taking up space in her phone due to the videos inside. I’ve told her a minimum of FIVE TIMES (def more) that the videos are in the cloud and they do not take up space on your phone because you haven’t downloaded them. I also said, DO NOT DELETE the videos. We may need them one day and again, THEY DO NOT TAKE UP PHONE STORAGE.  Today, we realized a package was delivered but taken from our porch. So I thought, cool, I can go back and check the video footage on the Ring. WHEN I TELL YOU I GASPED WHEN I FOUND OUT MY MOTHER HAD GONE THROUGH AND DELETED THE FOOTAGE.   I let her know for what seemed like the 10th time that the videos could not take up space because they haven’t been downloaded.  Then my heart dropped. I JUST lost my dog, young, due to a rare brain condition and I would make little videos outside on our Ring camera for me to look back on and laugh later on. I was happy I did it because his passing was sudden and unexpected. I scrolled to the last date I made a video with him and IT WAS GONE. ALL OF THE VIDEOS HAD BEEN DELETED and I LOST IT.   I screamed at her, told her she was so stupid and asked her why she didn’t listen to me. She told me she purposely deleted those videos because she found them sad.   AITA for reacting the way I did? I know she wasn’t being vindictive, but she’s a smart woman so I’m flabbergasted.  Edit: people keep saying, “videos are on her phone.” Yes, this is true - she had access to the videos because she has access to the Ring app which was on her phone.  She opened up the app, we BOTH share and deleted the videos on the app. The videos weren’t ON her phone, the app was. Does this make sense?  Edit 2: for those who asked why I didn’t back anything up. To be honest, I didn’t even know. I had no idea she would go through and delete all of the files and I also thought the calendar inside the Ring WAS the backup (at least on the app). When I needed to see a specific date, I could click on it and before everything was deleted, the videos would be there. I know better now on that part.  Edit 3: just got off the phone with Ring. They said she went in and deleted them from the Ring storage, therefore they have also been deleted from the companies storage and there is no way to get them back. Ring states that they do not have an external back up. So they are gone forever.\n",
      "I (16 F) was adopted by a gay dads two years ago.   My friends and I were having a fun zoom chitchat when one of my dad came in to tell me that he was going out and my other dad was having a important zoom meeting in the study so I cannot enter the study.  Now, we live in relatively small town where almost everyone knows everyone and it is pretty well known that my dads adopted me two years ago.   One of my friends asked me if I had two dads to which I replied yes and she got angry at me for not informing her that earlier.  She took offence to the fact that I didn't tell her about how my dads were gay even though I knew that she was a Christian and now she think I purposely hid that price of information from her knowing that she is a Christian.  She is now spreading lies about how I tried to change her religion by hiding the fact that my dads were gay. Most of the town knew the fact that my fathers were gay and therefore are not supporting her in these claims so now she thinks that I am purposely plotting against her so that she becomes an outcast for just following her religion.  I mean I knew that she was a Christian but I know a lot of Christians that are okay with homosexuality so I never thought of it as a big deal.  AITA?  UPDATE- I didn't expect this post to blow up this much. Thanks everyone for all the support and kind messages.  Some people were asking why did I even post this, I grew up going home to home so I never learnt about religion and thier beliefs and I genuinely didn't want to cause any problem.  I have informed my dads about this and we have decided to just ignore her and her antics but if she does do more things then my dad will have a talk with hers.  Thanks for all the support and love\n",
      "So my husband is pretty sick with some serious health problems. It's been hard, especially with everything going on in the world. Not a lot of people know because I just don't feel up to dealing with pity and the, well meaning but overabundant, bouquets that have been filling our small apartment like it's a funeral home.   Well with things opening up here, my friends and I decided to meet for an outdoor lunch at a local restaurant. Several of them didn't know what has been happening with my spouse including Emily, my friend. I usually avoid telling her about any problems we have because it becomes such a production. We've been friends for years, but lately my therapist has me questioning what if anything I actually get out of the relationship.   Anyway, I bring up what's going on, not expecting much but maybe a pat on the back and some comfort from friends. Well Emily did not go that route. Instead she burst into tears and started full on sobbing in a nearly hysterical way. There I was, the person going through this, dry eyed, and Emily started sobbing so much that our friends (used to this routine) immediately just started comforting her. The waiter even came over and asked if she needed anything.   I ask \"why are you crying?\" In an admittedly cold tone.   Emily: well I'm an empath, and I'm just picking up on all your emotions. It's like I'm crying for you.   Me: thanks, but I don't need you to cry, so this show isn't for my benefit.   Emily: well I can't help it, it's the problem of being an empath.   Me: You're not an empath, you're just a shitty friend who makes every problem about you.   So I left after promising another friend I'd pay her back for my half eaten burger. I was just getting angrier and she was sobbing even more, which just pissed me off more. It may have seemed harsh, but she's always like this! My aunt died and Emily had this same overblown reaction about a woman she has never met! If she's such a God damn empath then why is she not picking up how angry her attention seeking makes me? I've told her before how it makes me feel like her emotions always come first, even when I'm going through something, but she just tells me she's \"an empath\" so she can't help it.   My friends told me I need to be more thoughtful because Emily is \"sensitive\". Am I the asshole, reddit? I certainly acted like one, but I think her heartless attention seeking while I'm talking about my spouse nearly dying is a big AH move.  Edit: I appreciate the concern but my husband is not dying. He's okay, we are just in the middle of a recovery from some big problems. He just now fell asleep watching cartoons high as a kite, he's fine. Thanks for the well wishes!\n",
      "Names Changed / Throwaway  Michael and I have been close friends for over a decade. Both single, living in different states, and not ready to settle down with anyone, we occasionally meet up and enjoy each other sexually.  Recently, I visited his city and met some of his friends. His best friend's girlfriend and I hit it off and got into a really deep and mutually vulnerable conversation, during which I mention that I recently had an early-stage miscarriage after a night with Michael. Michael already knew about this miscarriage, but outside of me initially telling him about it, we hadn't/haven't discussed it much.  A little bit later that evening, I tell Michael that I told his bestie's gf about the miscarriage and he immediately starts yelling at me in public. Twice I try to take a walk and give room to calm down, but the yelling continues until I have a panic attack and go to bed. Weeks later, this hasn't been resolved.  His stance: I divulged personal details of his life to \"someone who is a complete stranger\" to me, which was socially indecent of me, and that it's his right to exhibit rage because I violated his trust. He believes it is OK for me to tell my friends and our mutual friends, but not his friends.   My stance: this was something I experienced and I should be able to share it, if I so choose, within reason. I was never asked or told not to mention it prior to that evening. I did not share this maliciously, but earnestly, within a vulnerable conversation.  AITA for telling his best friend's girlfriend that I had a miscarriage?\n",
      "Context is necessary here, so here we go. When I gave birth to my first biological child, everybody showed up at thr hospital. I didn't have a moment of down time, two sets of grandparents argued, I literally did NOT get left alone. Everybody had pictures all over the internet, nobody washed their hands... I did not enjoy myself.  So, fast forward almost seven years later, I'm giving birth a second time. Without going into detail, my husband and I both have our share of pushy family members. We decided to limit visitors to my parents, my step daughter (if her mom has to bring her to see the baby, that's entirely reasonable), and the daughter we had together. We also decided to ask people to call before coming once we get home. Asked that people not share pictures behind our backs with people we have conflict with. Please wash your hands, don't come if you're sick, etc..  I just decided to share all this in a very general Facebook post. That way, everybody sees it and nobody gets confused or offended.  But.... guess what? Someone got offended. I have a few family members who had a bad habit of pulling up at our house last time, honking, coming to the door, and expecting us to wake up our daughter after she was born.  My brother and his wife are our neighbors. They recently moved to town about a year ago after living two hours away. They felt this was pointed at them because they'll honk in the driveway sometimes. It wasn't, the post specifically stated not to do that because we had issues when our daughter was a BABY. They didn't even live near us then. I sent out nicely worded, sincere apologies to both my brother and his wife explaining the situation because I can see where it might have caused confusion since they DO honk in our driveway.  My brother is fine. My SIL won't speak to me. She says I was rude, it wasn't the point, she wanted to see the baby in the hospital, she shouldn't have to call, etc... threw a huge fit, called my mother.... I'm less than a week away from giving birth. She invited us over to eat supper and wouldn't even speak to me, even when I complemented her cooking or asked about her day. She feels like everything was pointed at her and nothing was.... nothing at all.  I don't know what to do or how to make it better, I've tried.  So, AITA?\n",
      "tl;dr - I rent a room at in apartment, but due to a new job on the other side of town I essentially am now living at my SO's place 24/7. My roommate still wants me to chip in on toilet paper and other supplies that I won't use, and pay a cleaning lady to come in to clean common areas that I have not used in months.   My apartment is a 3 bedroom. I rent one bedroom for 1/3rd of the overall rent/utilities. A couple rents the master bedroom and together they pay 1/3rd of the overall rent/utilities.  The third bedroom is rented by 1 person. It has changed renters multiple times since the lease started in May, but now there is a guy renting it. He pays the final 1/3rd of the rent.  Basically for a few months now I've been living with my SO due to my new job. Commuting from my apartment would take 1.5-2h in each direction. I have a 9h workday. Staying with my SO saves me a significant amount of time and improves my quality of life drastically.  My lease is up at the end of April, so I've left my furniture and some personal items at my apartment. I continue to pay my portion of the rent and utilities.  I only stop by the apartment occasionally to pick up more of my personal items from my room. In the time that I have been away, my female roommate has begun moving my items from the kitchen cupboards into my bedroom. This bothers me because she's doing it without asking me or even telling me she's moving my stuff. I don't need the space so they are free to use it, I just would prefer that they doing move my things without asking me. But that's beside the point.  She has now messaged me saying, \"I chose to live with roommates in order to cut down on costs. Even if people are away or on vacation, they need to pay their share of the costs.\" She wants me to chip in on toilet paper and she wants me to chip in on having a cleaning service come to clean the living room, kitchen and bathroom.  I refuse. I'm not using any toilet paper or other household supplies, so there's no reason to contribute to the cost. If I were using those supplies, then yes I would contribute, but she isn't really saving any money in either instance, because I'm going to use whatever portion I pay for.  As for a cleaning service, it is not my fault they have made a huge mess of the apartment. Whenever I'm around, I clean up after myself. When I was staying there I cleaned up after my messy roommates countless times. I'm not making a mess there, therefore I'm not going to pay for it.  So tell me... Who is the asshole?  Edit: To clarify, a cleaning service was NEVER agreed to at any point, especially not when we first signed the lease. They asked me while I was still living there and we agreed that we should all just clean up our own mess.  Edit 2: Still curious to hear people's thoughts, but here's an update. I'm giving them $25 in order to save myself the headache. I'm going there tonight with my SO to pack up as much of my stuff as is possible and either move it out or keep it in my bedroom. They get no more money out of me aside from the agreed upon rent & utilities.\n",
      "My boss (M 50ish or so) is a hoarder!!!!!!!!! He keeps magazines from 2009 that honestly, do not belong in our department. If something is broken he'll just take it to his office and keep it there hoping someone will fix it. And if it can't be fixed, he'll just put it in another room because \"we might be able to use parts of it later.\" Me and my other coworker have secretly cleaned out old papers, CD's, knick-knacks, broken equipment, etc when he isn't there.  Well, when COVID hit, we all had to take our stuff and get out of the building the week we shut down. While taking my lunch out of the fridge, I noticed that my boss (who already had got his stuff and left) forgot his salad. I texted him, asking if he would like me to toss it or if he would be coming back for it. He said he would swing by later and get it.  That was in March. We finally started back up again in June, but limited. Hours had been cut and because we had to clean the place every so often, we would work for about 2 hours then had to leave for 2-3. Because of this, we never ate there, we'd always go out or go home for lunch.  Now that it's starting to get a bit more relaxed, we are allowed to stay longer. This past weekend, I opened the fridge and low and behold, the salad is still there. I took it out and saw that it had expired in March.  I feel bad, but my coworkers think it should just be tossed and I agree. But, I also feel like I am stealing or something.  WIBTAH if I just tossed an expired salad that belongs to my hoarder boss?\n",
      "hello everyone,  so my grandpa has been admitted into the hospital about a week ago and he needs someone by his side over night to make sure he is well taken care of. Now, my mother is there every single night and has been asking me to accompany her because she needs the help and what not.  The problem is that i've recently got a job at a good company with really good pay and obviously since i am still new there, there are keeping me under probation meaning that i have to perform up to their standard otherwise they'd have to let me go. This situation has my mother act unreasonable saying that if i do t stay over i'm a selfish person and that i don't care about my grandpa and the family and even starts yapping about how she knows that when she is ever sick, i wouldn't be there for her. This has really gotten my nerves because it's not much that i can do, if i stay over it means that i wouldn't be able to focus at work nor would i be able to get any sleep and that whole thing would fuck everything up.  i'm beyond annoyed and she doesn't seem to think rationally because i believe that she's only doing so because she doesn't want to be alone or whatever. it's not like i'm not there when i do have the time. She just doesn't seem to understand that i've also got my own life to live. i've already missed a couple of days of work this week and even had to skip on a major presentation because she was acting like a total bitch and making me feel guilty by saying all sorts of random shit.  I need some clarification. Thank you.\n",
      "Worked for a company for 7 years, starting at entry level. They paid for my degree and I got several promotions until I made middle management but then stagnated, passed up for an upper management position due to \"lack of experience.\"  I started looking for new jobs and found a GREAT one. Upper management, $50k pay raise, better benefits, more vacation, 100% work from home. Been at the new job for 18 months and absolutely happy.   Last month we had a team member take a promotion with another team and I was part of the hiring team for his replacement. Interviewed 6 people, no good fits. Dozens of resumes but nobody we're interested in. My boss asks us, hey anybody know anyone in their networks that would be interested? They even dangled a $5000 referral bonus out.   I knew of a former coworker that was perfectly qualified for the role, and he was in a similar situation I was in where he had been passed up for promotions due to lack of experience. I reached out and he was interested in interviewing.   Sure enough, he knocks the interview out of the park and we offer him the position. Same situation I was in, he got a huge raise, career advancement, etc. When he gave his notice to management they asked how he heard about the opportunity. He truthfully told them that I had reached out to him.   Apparently they are furious at me due to this, and I've officially burned every professional bridge with my old leadership group. Originally I just chaulked it up as sour grapes, thinking if they wanted to retain their talented young employees they could promote and pay them. Also, it had been 18 months - not like I left and took coworkers with me.   Last week I brought this up with a friend, and he said the company was right to be angry, that I crossed a professional line, and you should never reach out to former coworkers unsolicited about leaving no matter what.   Is that true? Am I the asshole here?\n",
      "Today me and mom's plus her friend went to the gym and for some pretext, this friend is cool, but kinda nosy and a bit of a r/choosingbeggar. We all finish our workouts and then head outside, I'm left to my own devices waiting for them to finish their conversations so we can leave. At one point I happen to be standjng in front of them while they sat down and the convo is as follows:  \"So, when you getting married?\" At that my brain sorta short circuited, because of two things, A) I was occupied playing Skullgirls on my phone and B) I once lived in a small, close-knit and drama- filled town. Everyone in that town was nosy to the nines, at few points in time, my moms had to confront people who tried to manipulate me for information even after I had told them \"that's  none of their business.\" It's because of this upbringing, I'm a heavily guarded person and don't like to divulge what I consider personal info. So I had at this point clammed  up.   Because of my mom's and her bad information management, it's well known I have a boyfriend and we've been dating for a few years, so eventually someone was going to ask, but in the split second my brain cracked it also conjured up a bad, instinctive answer:  \"Dafuq?\" Yes, i know. Stupid, impulsive and very bad My mom's caught it while her friend was distracted. She immediately laid into me while her friend was confused. The friend then got back into it and asked what did I say,  and my mom's told her. She said she thought we were cool and with my mom's still laying in on me while, I recovered from my initial shock, she declared I was cut off then went back to talking with my mom's.  So my question is this, am I the asshole for my response and the way I view personal information, is she the asshole for just declaring that? I'm at a lost here.  Edit: This friend is pushing her 70s and single herself, if that affects anything\n",
      "Sorry for formatting on mobile & throwaway for embarrassment.  After dinner, my husband and I went to bed. I tried coming onto him and he said \"can we after a nap? I'm very tired.\" I said sure. While I did not expect to also fall asleep, I did. I forgot to set an alarm for myself and woke up a couple of hours later. My husband woke up before me. We have a child and I woke up because our son was crying. I was worried something happened to my husband (because usually he'd be making sure son was okay if crying). I went to son's room and husband wasn't there. The lights were off. I found husband in our wc, with headphones on, watching a video. He was supprised and said he guessed his headphones worked too well. He claimed he was looking at memes. We laughed it happens. However, I opened the trash to throw away a tissue and saw what looked like semen on a toleit roll. I asked if he had masturbated while in there and he said yes. This really upset me. For one, my husband is much lower libido than I am. I often go without sex that I'd like. Second, it makes me feel unwanted and hurt that he chose to watch porn instead of having sex with me when we were both home. It makes me feel like he doesn't find me as attractive as he says he does. If he did, shouldn't I be better than his hand and watching lesbians hump each other with fake dicks? It really annoys me. Third, he claimed that as our son was waking he wanted to be fast. However, our son was crying and he wasn't there. Fourth, he claimed that he did this because he \"didn't want to wake me\". He's woken me for sex before and I've literally never minded. I feel disgusted, annoyed, unwanted, jealous and hurt all in one. He claimed \"we could still have sex later\", but as I've mentioned he's lower libido and won't be able to for a while now. I feel so disgusted by this I also don't want to have sex with him anymore and I feel annoyed by this. We already don't have sex often as I would like. I've brought this up previously and he's said \"we need to make time for it\", but when I do he blows me off. I'm kind of just wanting to leave at this point. Am I the asshole? Thanks.\n",
      "i'll try to keep this short. and apologies im new to reddit and never used this subreddit before. anyways for some background information, my dad used to be a severe alcoholic. he drank a lot of hard liquor frequently and multiple times got shitfaced when i was visiting for the weekend. a couple examples were when he was so intoxicated, that when he came to say goodnight to me he lost his balance and fell on top of my three story barbie house. another time he got drunk during the day while i had two friends over. he was blaring his music, but after being asked to turn it down he just laid in his bed grunting. he wasn't doing anything, just making noises. my friends and i of course packed our stuff and left. after these two instances and more, my dad finally realized how badly his choices were affecting me and our relationship. he sobered up, especially since he had open heart surgery back in 2013 and had no choice but to not drink or else it wouldve killed him. these past experiences, plus with my mom's drinking problem, causing me very severe trauma, i am of course very uneasy when around people who drink. it hasnt been a problem because he hasn't touched alcohol for years. but in the last month he's been getting a 40 oz bottle of beer to drink maybe once every couple of weeks, i've not been keeping track. me being paranoid and uneasy around drunk people i question how much it is and the alcohol content. well tonight he got mad at me for supposedly putting him down constantly. i tried explaining him that it's just out of concern because i know his history of alcohol. he swears he'll never go back to hard liquor and im not saying i don't believe him, it's just that i admittedly start panicking when i see him drinking. does this make me an asshole? am i a bad person for not wanting him to drink in his own house? he keeps saying i can go live with my mom but she really isn't any better, and i dont have any immediate family or any friends to stay with.\n",
      "I (21f) and my oldest sister(25f) don’t really get along. In the past she’s been cruel to me and said some nasty things to me despite knowing that I was depressed and I was vulnerable back then. She would call me a useless freeloader for not helping with bills while I was in high school and while I couldn’t find a job after that.   In October I was finally hired by the school district my mother works at and I became a sped para! I was nervous at first but over time I became confident in myself and I enjoyed my job. As you know it’s summer and we have summer break. I thought I could relax for summer but my sister started mentioning job openings in my area. I thanked her for thinking of me but that I wasn’t going to get another job.   I had already forgotten about it when we went on a family trip. In the car she started asking me why I wasn’t working. And I responded with “because I don’t want to and that’s all”. She started getting mad and said that “not wanting to isn’t a reason and you’re being lazy”. I know that at this point she’ll never stop if I keep answering so I put on my headphones. She says “really? You’re doing this now?”. Our mother interrupted her and told her to stop it already. She starts crying then yells that everyone is treating me like a child and I’m getting away with it.   Now after not speaking to me she’s asking me to help her take care of her baby while she works because her fiancé is too sick to. If she hadn’t yelled at me in front of our family I wouldn’t have minded. But I don’t want to because now it’s convenient for her that I’m not working. Wibta if I refused?\n",
      "I [19/F] am a sophomore in college. I spent my freshman year living with a relative [60/F] in my college town because it would be cheaper and easier than dorm living or getting my own apartment, but in April, I made the decision to start looking for a place to live. To add a bit of context, my relative owns a large house and hires her daughter-in-law [30s/F] to clean the place semi-regularly since she doesn’t have the time to do so. Her DIL also works at her company with my father [57M], who called me this past April to complain about my “living habits” and saying I needed to “do more around the house” for my relative to make up for “taking up space” since I don’t pay rent.   The thing is, I do my own laundry, wash my own dishes, clean all messes I make in shared spaces, keep my room reasonable, & I take out all the trash. I have even asked my relative if she’d like me to do more, and each time she says no. I tell my father this, but he insists she doesn’t mean it when she says it, and then adds that he heard from DIL that my room was dirty and that I had “clothes everywhere” (there was a single load of clean laundry on my lounge chair) and that there was “food on my nightstand” (two water bottles, a small soda bottle, all sealed). I told him it seemed weird and kind of an invasion of my privacy that DIL would go into my room when I’m not there just to report back to him, and he said if I expected privacy then I should get my own place and pay my own bills. I immediately started apartment searching. I decided not to tell anyone until I had actually managed to find a living space that fit my criteria and accepted my application, because I had never looked for a place on my own before and had no idea if I would be successful. However, I did find a place, and I put in my application in early June. I was supposed to hear back within a month, and I did, but not from the apartment manager.   I got a call from my relative in the middle of the day saying she’d opened my mail and read my placement information, then asked why I was moving and who these girls (my roommates) on the paperwork were, who their parents were, etc. I told her I decided to get my own place and had been waiting until I got that confirmation paperwork to tell everybody because I wasn’t sure I’d even be placed, much less approved. That was pretty much the end of it, but since then I’ve been pestered about why I moved and had to deal with rumors. Very few family members seemed happy about the news. I attended a little family get together yesterday where the relative I’d been living with popped a joke about me moving without telling her, and it got me thinking about the situation all over again. Am I the asshole in this situation?  EDIT/INFO: I planned to tell my relative that I was moving as soon as I had confirmation that I was actually accepted. I was not planning a silent/surprise move. This was not the first time she opened my mail. She had never been given permission to do so. I don’t believe any of the times she opened my mail was a mistake, as I always found her husband’s mail separated from her own and left on the kitchen table for him to pick up when he came home.  EDIT 2- Please stop advising me to get a PO Box. I don’t need one. I’ve (obviously) moved & have a new address for mail. My address on my license has been updated in case any place that keeps it on file sends my info to that address rather than one I give them, as was the case with the mail that went to my aunt’s house.\n",
      "My friend, let's call him Ryan, is upset with me because I did not successfully ferry an expensive electronic that he had sent to my house due to forgetfulness. Ryan lives in a city three hours north of me and one state away. My state has no sales tax, and he visits my city infrequently for dates and parties. He claims that I am one of his closest friends, but usually he only visits me when he needs a place to crash after a party or has mailed something expensive to my place to evade sales tax.   My partner lives in the same city as Ryan. We'll call him Mike. Important, perhaps, to note that I met Mike through Ryan, they've been friends for over a decade. Mike and I take turns visiting each other, roughly every other weekend.   Ryan wanted to come visit last weekend, turns out that it was because he was sending a very expensive electronic with a high sales tax to my place. I wasn't going to be home. He asked me when Mike was coming down next, he told me that Mike could bring it on his way home. I explained that he needed to ask Mike directly. He asked and Mike said it was fine.  My birthday was this past weekend and Mike and I both took vacation leave from work for a five-day long road trip around the desert in my state, which is also why I was out of town. Mike and I rented an SUV since we both drive sedans and we needed space and a better vehicle overall. Since we were driving around the desert for 1000+ miles, the car got very dusty and the grill was caked in dead bugs. It was absolutely in need of a wash before we returned it, and since we both worked the next day after touching back down at my house, we were determined to clean it thoroughly but quick enough so that Mike could get home at a reasonable time for work in the morning.  By the time we were done, exhausted from the trip and the cleaning, Mike and I said our goodbyes without remembering Ryan's item.  Ryan texted us both separately this morning, asking Mike if he had the item. When Mike said that we forgot, Ryan angrily texted me telling me that he was pissed off at me and texted me a series of angry emojis and saying \"what the fuck\" and other really short but angry epithets. Ryan and I have been friends for about nine years, and he has had a history of berating me when he is upset if I am around him. I have attempted to distance myself from him, but feel guilty about cutting him off since we have so many mutual friends. I responded telling him that he did not give us a reminder after making the decision to use my place as his waypoint, and that we were busy at the time and reasonably distracted. He just told me to get it to him.  I think he is TA, my partner does too, but I am not sure if I (and my partner) are TAs for agreeing to do this favor and falling through on the commitment, especially given how expensive his order was.\n",
      "AITA? So my wife has accidentally hit our garage in the past. It’s a one car garage in our duplex, and last year she bumped it leaving a dent.   Going forward I have always parked her car in it for her. Well her hours have changed and she now leaves at 5am, so I wake up every morning with her to pull her car out and warm it up.   This month my car has decided to take a shit on me, so I ordered a new car and I told her when it gets here I would like the garage back since this new car is pretty expensive.   She’s been really angry about it, even though I still offered to go out in the snow and warm hers up/scrape the frost every morning.   AITA? I’ve never bought a brand new car before and I figured it needs to go in our garage when it arrives. I genuinely have no clue if I’m being an asshole lol. I understand she works early but I always warm up her car and get the frost off every morning it’s not in the garage.\n",
      "Throwaway for privacy reasons.  I'm a fully qualified mechanic. Over the years I've worked on friends cars for free, they just pay for the parts. For smaller things such as oil changes I do it with no expectation of getting anything in return, but for larger jobs works as a barter type arrangement: eg I'll fix my friends car and he'll do electrical work on my house. We try and balance things so one person isn't benefiting more than anyone else.  We have a friend from Church. She's a single parent of three, and is low-income, below the poverty line. I've done work on her vehicle such as brake pads and rotors, coils and spark plugs, alternator replacement, wheel bearings, fitted new tyres, oil and oil filter changes, air filter etc. All small jobs I could fit in without giving up too much time. I've never asked her for anything in return.  Recently she came to me about new work. Unfortunately, her engine is at a point where it basically needs to be rebuilt. She was quoted around $5-6000 for the job, which is fairly accurate for the work that needs to be done. Around 1/2 this cost is just for the labour.  She asked me to do it if she paid for parts and I said I'd think about it. I talked to my wife, and she said it was up to me to decide, but to make sure I wasn't being taken advantage of. I spoke to the friend and let her know that I wasn't able to commit to the job for nothing (it's about 20 hours worth of work), but I'd do it for half the labour cost, and if she was willing to use second hand/refurbished parts, I could get the cost down to around $3000.  She cried. She said she can't afford such costly repairs and she needs the car to driver her kids around. I said she could pay off the cost to me, but she wouldn't hear of it. She insisted I do the work for free because she was a friend in need, and the church teaches us to be kind and help each other out. She must have mentioned it to others, because a few people have expressed how disappointed they are in me for refusing the request and trying to take advantage of her.  I feel really bad. I know she struggles financially and the church have helped her a lot in the past with food parcels and bills etc. She really cannot afford to fix her car. I'm wondering if I should just let it go and fix it anyway.\n",
      "I had no idea what to call this post so let me explain. Also just got off work so sorry for grammar/spelling.  Im 24, and got a labor job right away out of highschool, it pays very well and has great benifits, becuase of this i was able to buy the condo my parents where renting at the time, i told them to keep the downstairs part, id live in the upstairs. I agreed to charge them half of what the other guy was charging, becuase i just wanted to cover some neccesities, not make a profit of my parents.   We live very independently, on my wishes. Everything we have is seperate, and although we visit eachother everyday, and after work i have dinner with them some nights, for the most part i like to have a fair bit of privacy.  When i first bought the place, i made 2 rules clear, they were not ever allowed to enter my area unless i was home and gave them permission and they where not allowed to guilt trip me if i didnt want company (sometimes its becuase i have other plans with my GF/friends, or i had a long day at work). No matter the reason they had to respect that.  The first few months was good, they followed the rules, and i enjoyed spending more time with my parents than i would had i moved across town. But the rules started to get broken more. At first it was my mom using the emergency key to get into my home too do laundry, clean up, and do dishes. I told her i appreciate it but i like my privacy, and it stopped. Until it started up again but this time she was doing those things and borrowing stuff (mostly pots, pans, food products/ingrediants they forgot)   They always respected the 2nd rule, but the 1st one was always trampled over, until last night. Last night my car was in the shop, and they must have forgot becuase i was laying in bed, post sex with my GF, and i heard the front door open, went to check and they are in my kitchen, casually doing dishes. I walked in half naked and politely asked them to leave. But that wasnt the end of it.  I went down later that night and told them if they didnt start respecting rule 1, i was raising rent back up to what it was before, and that im dead serious. I used this as a threat becuase my parents are not poor, and i know they could still afford it, i just know they wouldnt be able to afford as many luxuries as they have recently been buying.   my parents didnt say anything, but i got a mile long text from my brother basically calling me a huge dick, and telling me to respect my mother.  AITA?\n",
      "A few weeks ago we had a zoom meeting with our new boss, Kathy. We were discussing work matters when she suddenly asked my coworker Taylor if she was married and if her husband worked here or abroad. Taylor said she was married, and her husband was here. Kathy then said that if Taylor weren’t married, she would assume that there was something going on between Taylor and our other coworker Mark.   Mark is more than a decade older than Taylor and is also married with kids. He and Taylor carpool everyday to work since Taylor lives along Mark’s way to our office and doesn't have a car. The two of them also get along well and often have banters, but all four people in our team are fairly close friends.   My other coworker Jeff and I were silent while Taylor and Mark laughed awkwardly and said things like “She’s not my type” or “He’s old enough to be my father”. Kathy laughed and then resumed talking about work.   Mark later told me that he was really pissed about Kathy’s joke, especially since we were working from home and on loud speaker, so his and Taylor’s spouses could’ve easily heard that. I told him that the joke was definitely off as it implied that Mark and Taylor had questionable morals and I don’t know why Kathy thought it was a good idea to say that during our meeting. I later decided to report her to HR because I really didn’t think it was okay for her to be saying things like that.  HR reports are treated with confidentiality in our company and the complainant’s anonymity is protected as much as possible, so Kathy doesn’t know who complained. I guess she assumed that either Taylor or Mark did, because they say that she’s been picking on them, being snippy with them and overly critical of their work. Mark and Taylor don’t know who reported Kathy because everyone in our entire floor had learned about the joke she made, but Taylor is angry and said that whoever reported Kathy shouldn’t have done that because they weren’t the topic of the joke and she is blaming the complainant for Kathy picking on her now.   I feel sorry for Taylor but that the same time, I think it wasn’t out of line for me to do what I did because even though I wasn’t the topic of the joke, I was there when Kathy said it and it made me very uncomfortable that my boss was saying things like that. I don’t want to see the day when she could be making a similar joke about me.   AITA?\n",
      "Hi, im a young female currently unemployed due to quarantine and study. I'm fortunate enough to have a small weekly income from my parents for essentials during the week and the occasional job that gives me a few hundred dollars every few months.   I met this guy at my campus who was enjoyable to hang out with, some say that he took advantage of my kind heart and others would say that he's just in a rough patch. How he treats me is a different story so I won't go into detail about that because he 100% is the asshole in that sense. His parents are complete assholes and treat him like nothing, he's been kicked to the curb many many times and without a job or any sense of income, because I grew an attraction to him I was more than happy to help him out because at the time I had saved a decent amount of cash but over time he was costing me more money than I was during the week which is where the debate of whether I was taken advantage of kicks in. Since September he owes me easily over $300-$400, a few weeks ago he planned to pay me back $250 when he starts his job again but I told him not to stress about it because I honestly felt bad for his situation but informed him that I can not longer pay for him constantly. I gave in to his requests and racked up the amount to what its at now, he keeps telling me that he'll pay me back but every date comes around and I'll get \"I'll have to pay you next week\" I feel reluctant to tell him that I want all of it payed back because it'll just put more stress onto his life but I'm an unemployed student who needs the money.  He physically doesn't have the cash to cover all of it and he probably wont have the luxury of paying back close to $400 for a long LONG time if ever. AITA for wanting him to pay me back the money?\n",
      "Some context: My ex (24M) and I (24F) were good friends for a while and eventually started dating. This only lasted around 3 months however, as I broke up with him. Since then we've gone back to being friends, and he started dating one of my friends who I had introduced him to shortly after.   Around half a year later, the two of them had a period of trouble with their relationship, and my ex messaged me for comfort since it was affecting him a lot emotionally. He then suddenly started talking about how being in his current relationship made him feel guilty towards me and our previous relationship, which made me kinda angry as I personally felt that it was really unfair to his current girlfriend. I told him that I didn't have any romantic feeling towards him anymore, so he shouldn't feel guilty and let it go, and that I thought it was actually really rude to his girlfriend. He became very upset after I said that and said it felt like I was kicking him while he was already down.   He spoke with another friend of ours about the conversation, and our friend then told me that he also thought I was too mean and should apologize, but while I do think it was harsh, I still feel like it's what he needed to hear.  So AITA for telling him that while he was going through a rough patch?\n",
      "So I(M,22) have been getting bombarded from my mother that I should try to have a relationship with my two half brothers...  They never were around when I was growing up because my parents relationship is the result of infidelity in their marriages. Basically they both were cheating on their former spouses. They’re both getting up there in years since they had me very late in life. Because of their age and decline in health my mother thinks I need to have a relationship with her son and my father’s son... I don’t want to do that to them though. I am not my parents, but I have no doubt my existence causes them some level of pain. I’ve survived without them in my life and they’re both over 40.   My parents relationship devastated their partners and from what I’ve heard from my aunt it absolutely destroyed their mental health. It happens 24 years ago, but still I can’t help but be furious that my two parents didn’t care enough to properly end a relationship and divorce. Instead they moved in together while they filed for divorce. I can’t believe how callous they were, and honestly it shows in how they treated me.  My mother keeps berating me over the phone that I should contact them since life is too short, but I just can’t. I don’t have the right to butt into their lives just because we share DNA. This is also driven by the fact my father’s oldest son passed away without my father finding out a year later. I don’t understand why my parents aren’t ashamed of the pain they caused and why they feel entitled to all of their children having a relationship.  My mother called me a narcissist and that I was acting like I was better than them. From what I understand they didn’t go to college and I’m in a masters program, but I don’t see how that makes me any better? I had a bad relationship with my parents to begin with, but this has made it worse and I’m contemplating cutting ties since I’m 6 states away and they don’t know my address. It kinda sounds fitting for two lying cheater to be abandoned by all of their children.  As of right now I’ve told my mother to pound sand about it and drop it, but she keeps texting while I ignore her.  So everyone, am I the asshole?\n",

It’s a Union site and we are not allowed to work, handle, or operate other trades materials, we are strictly to observe and report. One of the health and safety inspectors reported a pallet of 50lbs bags of fireproofing dust that contains silica stacked apx 10’ sagging over held up only by the plastic wrap, about to collapse.   When the head safety person saw the report he told us to “push it upright”   I told him that if we push on the load and it collapses we could get crushed under the 50lbs bags, or if the bags break open exposed to toxic dust.

Here's some of the bigger instances that have stuck with me: He kept my sisters, older cousin, mom, and I from leaving his house for a week by taking their car keys, stealing from all of us in the process. He destroyed our house and sold our stuff when we went to stay with my grandparents for a few days. He abandoned us at the beach to go drink and we were forced to sleep on the sidewalk for an hour or 2 before he showed up in the night to pick us up. (These all took place within the same year)  4 or 5 years ago he went to jail for domestic battery and \"turned over a new leaf\" so my mom let him come back around and I was forced to live in my grandparents garage with him and the rest of my family for 3-4 years, acting like nothing happened. I moved into my grandparents living room last year so I got some small relief for a moment.  Then my mom died suddenly in March. It's obvious that it hit him hard but I don't care. I can't stand to be in the same room as him for long and he's trying to be around us more but it just makes me anxious to the point where my teeth chatter. My dad had no interest in teaching me to drive before but now that my mom isn't around anymore he needs me to get a license so I can take him to and from work since he doesn't have a license.  My mother's biggest wish was to move out of my grandparents garage and into a house and my father told me he finally counted his money and we have enough to move out. But would it be selfish of me to leave him to care for my sisters, with no way of transportation? I fear that I'll be trapped in the same cycle as my mom was if I don't leave when I have the chance.\n",
      "I had a boomer great aunt that was a wonderful and loving woman.  She just grew up in Eastern Europe right after WWII.  One of the weird things about her was that she would give her old belongings as gifts for weddings and important birthdays.  I still have the music box she gave me for my First Communion. When we saw family I would always ask to see their pieces.  A few of my aunts had them displayed in a china cabinet or out somewhere safe.  A few had them collecting dust in a box.   I made sure they knew that if the day ever came that they wanted to downsize or something I would appreciate a chance to grab it for my collection. Some of my cousins took me up on the offer and I ended up with six extra pieces for my room.  When I moved out I made sure that every single part of my collection was safely wrapped and packed.   They are my little treasures.  I know it's weird.  Sorry for being so long winded.  I just love talking about that stuff.  I'm about 15 years younger than my eldest brother and he knows about my collection.  When he got married I was 14. At his gift opening I saw he got one of her usual gifts.   I also saw his wife's face.  She was not super grateful.  I made sure he knew that I thought it was beautiful but I didn't ask him to think of me if he wanted to get rid of it.  I thought he might like to pass it on to his kid one day.  When my aunt passed away she left me the last of her collection.  Three pieces that were a set.  I got married last September. My niece, his daughter, was my flower girl.  At my gift opening I could almost hear him giggle when I opened my gift from them.  It was the piece from our great aunt.  He thought it was super funny.  Then he gave us our \"real\" gift from our registry.  I thanked him profusely for both.  He came over the other day and saw my collection in my china cabinet I inherited. He asked me why I was so fascinated with this stuff.  I told him that I thought it was amazing and that lots of people collected it.  He called bullshit and started looking it up.  The figurine he gave me is worth about  $6,700.  He said that I was a dick for not telling him what it was worth.  He wants it back.  I said  that my husband and I were going to give back every piece I got from family as a gift for a special occasion.  I already planned to give that piece to my niece for her first communion. Along with a little booklet of information about my aunt and the value of the piece so they appreciated it.  I know exactly who I got each piece from. And they are all going back to that family.   He says I'm being mean accepting a gift from him that is worth so much.  I asked him if he ever bothered looking up.the value of what he was giving me.   He said he thought it was like precious moments or Hummel.  Whatever.  I have family treasures to keep safe for the next generation. I know I would have gotten something awesome from my great aunt if she hadn't passed away before my wedding.\n",
      "Very recently I had an over the phone issue with my soon-to-be MIL. The background is that she, my fiancée, and I had made arrangements to split costs for gifts for her two teenage sons. I came up with a suggestion that would make my fiancée and I's contribution even with hers but split between two different checks so we could maintain some money in our accounts between the two checks. When I relayed this suggestion to her she went completely around me to her son and told him she didn't need us paying if we couldn't afford it and telling him she disagreed. My fiancée brought this to my attention and I stated that I was frustrated that she hadn't come to me, the person who had the idea in the first place and the person who brought it up to her in the first place. She typically goes around me so this wasn't the first time this issue has come up. I told her that I was upset that she keeps going around me to him especially as far as finances go. I've always been the one between both of us that is hands on with our finances. I always know what we do and don't have money for and its not for lack of trying to involve my fiancée. She then turned the discussion into saying we put work and money before family and that she thought a promise he and I made to each was BS and that she blamed me for her adult son moving away from her. I told her i respected and understood her feelings and tried to reassure her that i wasn't keeping him, I've always made it clear that he can go anytime he wants or that he can move back in with her if he wants. Ive been very supportive of them having a healthy relationship and often have to nag him to call or contact his family. I told her i was upset that she keeps avoiding talking to me and told her that family means a lot to me, so her words hurt. She kept repeating the same things in different words clear up until I bid her goodnight. Since then she has made posts on her social media openly jabbing at me and my discussion with her as well as making comments to my fiancee such as \"I'd ask you about this, but it seems like you have no say in your relationship.\" And even going so far as to ask him if i was still butthurt over what was said. I've told him i feel disrespected by both of them and that i feel that im owed an apology for how she's treated me. AITA for feeling this way?\n",
      "So, a little context... My ex is a very controlling, manipulative and angry kind of person. She was with me and is very much more so with my son. There are many 'secrets' my son has told me... things her boyfriends have done to him (not anything bad enough to report but just little mean things), things she has said, behaviours etc. Which all contribute to my 9 year old son now being a very quiet, private person.  My son is never like that with me. He tells me everything. But I always promise I won't mention anything to his mom (unless it is so detrimental and then I note it down for my lawyer too), because he is scared of her reaction (he gets daily mouthfuls as it is and she would go nuts if she found out I knew something b4 her). So.... my son is 9 years old and has his first crush. He has a poor view of \"love\" thanks to his moms personal relationships, but finally he met someone who hasn't put him off. He was reluctant to tell me at first but the barrage of texts between them made me wonder and he finally admitted she asked to be his girlfriend and he said yes. May I point out.. that means they sit together at lunch, they occasionally hold hands... they talk CONSTANTLY by text and follow each other on tiktok... they DO NOT kiss because, you know, that's yukky!! So, he wanted her to join us for dinner. I have him every weekend so said she could come for dinner after school on a Friday when I pick him up if that's ok with her mom. Since then, me and her mom have been in touch and set it up and both kids were very excited. This week my son finally told his mom that he has a girlfriend at school. She was reluctant but accepted it as an innocent thing (after some convincing and reassurance). However, I didn't find this out till 2days before the 'date' I had set up. When we were talking she was telling me he had told her he said he would be her boyfriend this week. So I can't tell her I already know about her being his girlfriend because she will go nuts at him for coming to me first (this has been proven many times in the past) but I also can't tell her we have a date set up on Friday where I take them both for tea after school because I shouldn't  know already. AITA?? I plan on informing her on the day that she is coming too... like it's spur of the moment, but I feel I can't tell her I've arranged it already (so much so that I am in contact with her mum and we've arranged a simple supervised play after school on the park and fast food meal and her mum pick her up when we are done). I just don't want my 9 year old getting abuse for being a normal kid hanging out on a play date (though they think they are in love because they hold hands!) and something he could never tell his mum about but can tell me. Iv always prided myself on the fact my son knows I am a 'safe space' and will only confront her if it's about his safety and well being. What do people think?  Edit: already getting comments for writing in a shorter way so spelling etc corrected.\n",
      "I, 18 FM have a pretty narcissistic mother. She likes to make subliminal remarks as insults towards me with my brothers and every time I snap back I’m quickly outnumbered. I get told I’m “too sensitive”, and that I need to “check my attitude”. (Gaslighting at it’s finest). They have a habit of joking about my personality, making it seem as if I’m ditzy. I’m sure this has had a toll on me, because I have a really hard time “loosing up” because I hate being the center of jokes, and my mom can’t understand that.   So today, I went in my moms room and she asked me to move something out the way and I asked her “is this a good spot?” And she told me, “obviously it is, idk how you get good grades.” I replied with, because I’m smart and she said uhh idk about that your kind of stupid sometimes, and I got really upset. I told her to move it yourself then and she deflected from the fact her joke was hurtful and that she had no reason to apologize because she’s my mom and that she obviously didn’t mean I was stupid. I was more upset at the fact she wouldn’t just own up to her mistake. She then started bringing up that this is why I have a hard time making friends and why I got into a argument with my boyfriend because I didn’t like his joke. Unlike her, he understood my feelings and stopped making any jokes like that the first time. Just deflecting off what she did.  Now, she’s saying I should stay home with my attitude if this is how I’m going to act.\n",
      "I have two daughters, Lena (13) and Zoe (17). For their schooling I've always encouraged them to try, rather than caring about grades. I've always found work ethic, resilience and responsibility to be more important than smarts alone, so I would say that what I always focussed on. School is properly back this year, so my wife and I decided to reward them if they did well. I would say the expectations were clear, and about them behaving well rather than grades   EDIT  Since people didn't understand. The reward was contingent on good behaviour. 'doing well' refered to their effort, see my next sentence explaining my expectations were about behaving. I NEVER changed the basis of reward  The girls semester report came out yesterday. While the main focus is academics, each subject also grades and comments on behaviour in class. Lena got mostly Cs, but she struggles with school so that's an achievement for her. Her teachers all graded her behaviour as perfect. and mentioned how she was clearly trying and everything. Zoe, to put it very crudely, basically had all but one of her teacher's saying she's extremely smart (almost straights As), but a complete AH and a problem in class. So in my opinion, Lena should be rewarded, but not Zoe.  Still, that night we took them both out and celebrated finishing the semester. We did say we were proud of them and everything. But today I talked to Zoe about what her teachers said. She says it's not her fault her teachers suck and are boring, which may be true, but she still can't be rude or distract others. Zoe really wasn't happy about the discussion, and got upset when I told her she wouldn't be rewarded. She basically thought her grades should mean it's fine, and that I'm punishing her when it's not her fault. I decided to leave the discussion for later when she was calmer, but made it clear that while I'm disappointed in her acting up, I do still love her and am proud of her doing well scorewise.   By this evening it seemed to have calmed, but Zoe overheard Lena talking to my wife about deciding on her reward, and got angry again. She said it's unfair that Lena is getting rewarded for bad grades, but she gets nothing's for As. I tried to take her aside and talk to her explaining that it wasn't about the grade, but she didn't take it well and claims that we love Lena more and are favouring her. That it's unfair that she has such lower standards to meet, but that's not the case.  My wife feels bad and changed her mind and thinks that maybe we should reward her with something since she did so well academically, and it was struggle to adjust given everything. But I don't think we should reward her for misbehaving. Even if she scores well, if she acts up it can harm other students, I know that happened back when I was in school. I haven't changed my mind, and don't thinks it's wrong. But my wife clearly think that it's an AH move.\n",
      "It’s a tricky one because I know he hasn’t exactly got hundreds of people he classes as friends, but he’s been particularly “intense” (I think that’s the word) lately and I really just want to crack on revising for exams.  Example, today I went offline for an hour to study, and he’d messaged me on Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook Messenger because he wanted to talk. I told him I was studying, he knows I’ve got exams, I’d already spoken to him this morning, and he wants to chat like 4-5-6 times a day. If I end the conversation he’ll just message again in 20 minutes and if I don’t reply he’ll message on a different social media platform.  Would I be the arsehole if I tell him to leave me alone - at least until exams are finished.\n",
      "Last night I ordered a Pizza from a chain pizza joint. I live pretty close to the store so they quoted 30 minutes for delivery time.   45 minutes later this sweaty over weight ~28 year old comes up the drive way wearing 90s track suit pants up to his navel and covered in bubbles from being washed over a period of years. His chest was mostly covered in pimples and he had a beard stretching from his cheeks to his neck with no distinguishable indicator of where his mandible ended and neck started.  When he hands me the pizza which was at least hot I notice cheese is coming out the sides of the box where it opens. So I open the box hoping they loaded it with cheese to see that two slices are stuck to the roof of the box and the rest are separated and mushed. The ceiling of the box looks like an abstract art piece.   So I calmly and nicely go “ok what happened here? This pizza was late and it’s been all messed up.”  He returns fire with “ I don’t know bro the boss sent me out here when he was good and ready and sorry about the mess it fell off me [sic] seat when I slammed the brakes on at a red light”.   I’m like whatever because the pizza is piping hot and clearly edible however I wasn’t going to tip because he messed up my pizza due to what I’m assuming was some kind of distracted/bad driving and he was calling me “bro” and seemed irritated that I wasn’t just accepting a late, turned over pizza without question.   So I am like bye and go to close the door when this guy literally puts his hand out like in a cartoon or movie and I had to explain to him what happened and I don’t think tips should be mandatory.   After I advised him he will not be receiving a tip from me he called me a “white asshole” (dude looked white to me) and kicked over my kids jack-o-lantern.   Is tipping really mandatory? AITA for being a traditional tipper?\n",
      "I have a platonic friend at work, lets call her Pam, we are both married and don't have any romantic feelings for each other. I say that upfront, because I know how it may look like.  We don't work in the same department, but still had to work together for quite a while. Think of it like a big project for multiple years. I am very introverted and don't easily connect with a lot of people, but we became kinda close and spent a lot of breaks together, like eating breakfast daily, lunch most of the time and just the usual coffee breaks. We never met or meet outside of work.  After the project ended we moved to different positions and different locations inside the company. It's a 10 minute walk if we want to meet now, combined with new responsibilities it was of course impossible to meet as regularly as we were used to. But we found a weekly slot where we could meet and have lunch together, take a walk together or just sit somewhere to talk, we even had a recurring meeting in Outlook to block that slot for us (that part is important I think). I was happy that we at least found that small little slot, because how I said: I don't easily connect with people at work and was happy to found a good work friend who I can openly talk to.  This worked for a few weeks, then another co-worker (Bob), who also worked for for that project but left the company after it was done, announced (via a telegram group chat that a few people including me and her were part of) that he will be in the area and asked if someone wants to have lunch. Of course it was exactly the day and time where we had our recurring meeting. Pam immediately said yes, as did another co-worker of the group. She then even asked me privately if I would join, too, but already said that I probably won't. Which is correct, I never was the biggest fan of Bob and not a fan of group activities in general. I knew that we couldn't talk, because main topic obviously would be the new job of Bob and the new position of Pam or the other co-worker. Things I either already knew or that I don't care about.  I was very pissed. She didn't ask if we could move or cancle our meeting, she just agreed to have lunch with Bob. She couldn't really understand why I was so angry, for her it was just normal to skip it for someone who isn't at the location that often anymore. For me it was just very disrespectful and also hurt my feelings. After that I just canceled the recurring meeting, which she didn't even comment on and we wouldn't meet for a few weeks after that.\n",
      "I (25M) usually cook all the meals for me and my girlfriend (25F) throughout the week I'm just the better cook, but on weekends she normally makes breakfast. Today and like the past month or so she tried to make bacon, but it was burnt to an absolute crisp like black all over with maybe a smidgen of non burnt in the middle. Yeah the waffles, sausage, and eggs were great I tell her that everytime, but like every other time she tried to cook bacon and I told her it was burnt and tried to correct her methods \"just take it off a little earlier\" \"turn down the heat a little\". Hell, I even showed and taught her how to make it 3 times in the past month.   My only real issue is we split the groceries and I buy the bacon, its expensive I guess inflation. But now she's upset and not speaking to me because I didnt eat the bacon and that I wasnt grateful. I'm upset because the bacon was a waste and now it resembles strips of charcoal in the trash can. I even proposed the solution that I will cook the bacon if need be no big issue. She doesn't eat bacon, so it's not like she's cooking it for herself too. AITA?  TLDR: GF always burnin the good bacon till its black and crispy even after I taught her how to make it multiple times. Now she's mad at me for not eating it.\n",
      "The title may be a bit misleading, so I will start this off by saying this is not a “shop VS adopt” situation and this has nothing to do with me talking her out of adopting a dog because I have something against adopting animals.   So my friend, let’s call her Amy, just recently moved out of her parents house into her own place. She always said she wanted to get a dog as soon as she moved out (her parents never cared for pets). So after she moved in and got settled, she decided to get a dog. I’m a HUGE dog person, so she invited me along to help choose a dog to adopt. We get to the shelter and they lead us to all of the available dogs (she had no prerequisites: breed, size, age, she was open to anything).   So we get there and the first dogs we see are two beagles (about 2 years old, brother and sister from the same litter, the other puppies and the mom didn’t survive their abusive previous home — the shelter girl spared no detail). Amy was absolutely in love with the guy beagle, and pretty much was set on choosing him (first dog we saw). The shelter girl said that the two beagle siblings were inseparable and she strongly suggested adopting both instead of just one (apparently the two have separation anxiety). Well Amy didn’t want 2 dogs, and she also has a very weird, wrong opinion that “girl dogs are more work”. So she was dead set on adopting this beagle. I told her she shouldn’t adopt him if she’s not gonna take his sister, and she should leave them for someone who will (it’s a no kill shelter). I told her it wasn’t fair to either dog, think about how said they’d be their first nights apart? Just picturing their sad beagles cries to each other from their respective places broke my heart. She got mad at me for not supporting her choice, but I couldn’t support separating the two pups. They really looked attached to each other. So I told her that this was only the first dog she saw, and that she’d easily fall in love with another dog if we kept looking. She got even more mad about that and said that she knew at first sight this dog was right for her, and as a dog lover I should respect the connection she had with the dog. I did not change my stance. I told her it was cruel to separate the two, and that she can easily find another dog that would make her just as happy, without separating two puppy siblings that needed each other.   She got so mad about my lack of support, that she decided to leave and proclaimed that she’s not gonna get a dog at all because “I now think that she’ll be a bad dog parent because I didn’t side with her”. So she’s really mad at me, won’t talk to me. I don’t think I did anything wrong but our mutual friends think I’m in the wrong here, so AITA?  TLDR: I didn’t support my friends decision to adopt just one dog and not their sibling, and when I suggested she either adopt both or a different dog, she left without adopting any dog and is now mad at me. AITA?\n",
      "TL;DR Mom watches me and boyfriend sleep, can't give me a real answer as to why.  So I wasn't really sure where to post this, but I felt like this sub was the most fitting.  I have posted before about my family, especially my mother and all the weird/shitty things they've done. This, though, is just really crossing a line.  Backstory: I got my apt for my friends and I to live in. Unfortunately, my mother, sister and niece all had to move in with me. Initially I was fine with it, but my mother's behavior since moving in has gotten worse and worse. My boyfriend recently moved in, which I'll be eternally grateful for.  Now to the reason of my post today.  Over the past 2 or 3 weeks my boyfriend and I have been woken up by the sound of my door opening. It's usually early on the morning so we dismissed it as my mother letting the dog into the room before she leaves for work.   My boyfriend tends to stay awake longer than me and is a much lighter sleeper. Over the past week he's noticed that my mother will open the door randomly at night and just stare into the room for at least a minute before walking away without closing the door again. When we discussed it we talked about all the reasons why she'd be doing that, but couldn't really come up with an answer.  This last night I was awake all 3 times she opened the door and was able to see what exactly my boyfriend was talking about. I have horrible nightmares as is so seeing a pale face just staring into my room in the middle of the night is absolutely terrifying. So I finally confronted her about it this evening.  I kept grilling her about why she'd do that, but it was \"The cat was crying\" (he was dead asleep on my bf) or \"I was going to let the dog in but he didn't want to\" (again, my dog never doesn't want to come into my room) or \"I was leaving for work so I opened it\"  She's pretty annoyed that I just kept asking her why she was doing this. I feel like she's being creepy af. My boyfriend thinks we need to be a little more assholish in this situation. So AITA for confronting my mom? Are we just overreacting?\n",
      "So in my school there’s this rule where you can’t leave through the front gate, u can only leave through the back gate. The issue is, the back gate is tiny and rly rly far off the campus, it takes like 20min to get through the gate because all 2000students are shoved through that tiny ass gate , one evening i was having rly rly low blood pressure and i couldn’t bring myself to stand because i felt like i was going to faint or at least vomit. My nrother came to pick me up in the car so i just ran out the front gate, ignoring the guard. The guard then scolded me the next day for ‘flunking the rules ‘. Although i have seen almost all teachers use the front gate with absolutely no issue land a few students as well . I have been in this school for about 4 years now and there has never been any sort of issue before this rule was put into place. So i don’t rly know how to feel. AITA?\n",
      "So tomorrow we were supposed to go to the tattoo parlour for a consulation that she is having  (her first tattoo), and afterwards we would maybe do something fun together. Apart from my job, i am the treasurer of an organisation and our organisation had to meet with another organisation to settle finances for an event that has passed (therefore, its important i be there) . Unfortunately, the people in charge of setting the meeting decided that tomorrow during the time that we will be at our tattoo appointment.  Obviously, i tried my best to change the time but no one else was available at other times or days. The moment i told my girlfriend she was extremely pissed at me, which i understand completely.

      "Whew boy do I feel like an asshole typing that, but I'll try to explain myself as much as possible.  My friend has been sleeping rough for some time, because her parents are awful. She's been couch-surfing at various friend's places since then. Meanwhile, I've only just moved out of my toxic parent's house (less than a week ago) into a sharehouse, where I stay in a small room with a single bed.  The other day she messaged me saying that she needed a place to stay, and I immediately said yes, because it wasn't like I was going to throw her out to the street.  However, I'm now seriously doubting it, as awful as that sounds. It's not a good excuse, but I have pretty bad social anxiety and I'm a hardcore introvert - the big reason I moved out of my parent's house was because I never got enough alone time, and my mental health has drastically improved since I moved out into my own private room where I'm never interrupted. When she's staying here, my friend would be sleeping on an air mattress on the floor next to my bed. Just the thought of having someone there while I'm sleeping, waking up in the morning when I usually feel like shit, not being able to just sit in silence for hours, etc., stresses me the hell out. To make matters slightly more frustrating is I have pretty bad eczema, that I try not to be self-conscious about, but I am. My room is my own little sanctuary where I can scratch as much as I please and spend time slathering myself in moisturiser however much I want. Having anyone else there while I'm doing this is intensely embarrassing.  However, I'm very aware that her sleeping rough is a horrible situation to be in, so if need be I'll suck it up and let her stay. However, I have some savings and it's easy to book into an Airbnb or hotel or whatever here quickly, so I'm honestly torn between just letting her stay or asking if she'd be okay if I paid for her to stay in a nice place for a week or so until she's found long-term accommodation.  The answer might be glaringly clear to others, but being the anxious introvert I am, if I was in her position I would be taking any option that would mean I didn't have to share a room with somebody... So I really don't know if it would be a totally asshole thing to suggest, or if she might be okay with it? Any input or way to resolve this situation would be much appreciated.  TL;DR: My friend has been sleeping rough and would like to stay at my place for a week; however, I live in a sharehouse and she would be sleeping on an air mattress on the floor next to my bed. I'm a socially anxious hardcore introvert with a skin condition who values my alone time above all else, and I'm wondering if she'd be okay with staying in an airbnb or hotel (that I pay for) instead of having to share a room with my flaky awkwardness.\n",
      "I have a year old daughter and I've been pretty consistent with no electronics with her since Day 1, my mother (Grandma) let's her play with her phone and got mad + going to her room because I don't want her to become dependent on it and moved her away from the phone. when I'm trying to teach her to walk with positivity and actually having a connection with her and not a screen.

      "A few weeks ago my house mates and I threw a party and we all agreed to chip in for alcohol. I spent about 40 and split between all of us it was about 10 each. A week went by before I asked any of my housemates for money back. 2 people paid me back immediately, and 1 just ignored my messages in the group text. Today she asked if someone could pick up a loaf of bread for her while at the grocery store and I agreed since I was already there. When I got home to bring her bread I asked if she could just add the bread to what she already owed me so like $15. She immediately suggested that she shouldn’t have to pay because only her boyfriend came to our party and neither of them drank that much of the alcohol I had purchased. I can kind of see where she is coming from because she doesn’t have many friends, but at the same time she had already previously agreed to chip in and i think she should have thought of that before agreeing to it. Personally for me it isn’t about the money, its just annoying.\n",
      "Hi all.  I’m experiencing a moral dilemma and need your guidance.  A few years ago I had a FWB. He and I would meet up here and there and there were no strings attached. I still have him on Facebook and Instagram years later because we’re amicable (though we don’t speak on a regular basis, if at all).   Last weekend, he sent me a “you up?” text. I was a little taken a back by this because A) I’m clearly in a LTR based on my social media posts, B) I haven’t heard from him in two years, C) I suspect he has a girlfriend. I responded no thanks bud, I’ve been with my boyfriend for years now.   This entire encounter didn’t sit right with me. So naturally, I did some sleuthing and dug through his social media. Though he doesn’t have much evidence of his girlfriend (I assume, intentionally) I did manage to find her Instagram handle and found out that they had just moved in together. The week before he texted me. And this asshole was liking all of the photos related to their move in in a seemingly excited way!   I’m a little bit appalled by this and by the fact that he didn’t even come back with a “oh sorry I was drunk when I sent that!” response to me rejecting his offer. Instead he told me to basically call him if my situation changed.   So, would I be the asshole if I contacted his girlfriend out of the blue and told her about his attempt to cheat? I have never spoken to her and honestly wouldn’t have known about her had I not dug DEEP into his profile and saw a comment she made on a photo. Do I owe her anything?\n",
      "&#x200B;  I am a junior in college and live with three other roommates (all 20M) in an off-campus apartment. We will call these roommates M, T, and D in this post to preserve their anonymity.  This past Thursday, D borrowed my car because my car was blocking his in.  Fast-forward to Saturday night, my car has not been touched since Thursday night, D wants to take my car out to go to the gas station and get some snacks. He heads out the door and about two minutes later, he comes back into the apartment and says that my car won't start because the battery is dead. He then says something about how when he took it out on Thursday night the \"lights were being weird\" I said \"Oh, did you leave a light on?\" and D said that he was pretty sure he didn't (obvious lie here, trying to cover his ass). Rather than trying to help and solve the problem, D was more concerned with directing the blame away from himself (not the first time this has happened, more on that later). When we eventually get the car jump-started, the cabin lights are toggled on. I point this out to D and he blames it on T (was with him in the car on Thursday). This pretty much made me lose my shit so I went back inside before saying anything I would regret.  As I briefly mentioned earlier, this isn't the first time that D has demonstrated this kind of behavior. For the sake of brevity, I'll keep it short but basically this kid has a really hard time accepting that he is at fault of anything (T and M both completely agree with me on this). If anyone doesn’t believe me or wants some sort of proof just send me a PM and I can provide numerous examples.  Sunday afternoon comes along and all four of us are sitting in the living room watching a football game. T asks D why he blamed him for leaving the light on and they bicker for a minute before I get them to stop. I said I didn’t care about what happened with the light and that D was responsible for what happened because he was the driver. Eventually, I was able to get D to understand why I felt that way although it was not easy. I also told him that I felt disrespected by the fact that he would continue to lie to me rather than just admit his mistake. I continued by saying that his lack of self-accountability was becoming a serious problem. He was not happy to hear this and told me to give more examples which I did. He shrugged all of them off and said that this stuff “isn’t a big deal” and that I was being a dick by calling him out so harshly and that I should just “get over it”. I felt like calling him out was basically doing him a favor by giving him a wake-up call to his toxic behavior. He seems unbothered by the whole ordeal and doesn’t seem to understand what he’s done to make me upset. After thinking about this whole thing for a while I’m wondering if he’s right and I’m making a mountain out of a molehill. So, saints of Reddit that read this whole thing, AITA?\n",
      "The day started out like a typical Wednesday afternoon for us.  We have roughly a 600 sq ft apartment which consists of an open living room/kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.  Needless to say, there aren't very many options if either of us want some privacy.  My girlfriend works from home so she doesn't really have a set schedule; whenever she feels like working she'll bust out her laptop and get to it.  We're both sitting on the couch; I'm playing a video game with a headset on (no external audio is being played) while she is working right next to me.  She makes business calls sporadically and I'm so focused on killing noobs that I can't tell exactly what she's doing at any given moment.  I had an awesome kill in the game and kind of when \"ooohhhh\" to myself, and she instantly raises her finger at me as if telling a toddler to hold their horses.  She happened to be on a phone call and I had no clue.  I get ever so slightly irritated and carry on quietly.  She finishes up her phone call, slides off my headset ear cup nearest her, and sternly says, \"if I'm on the phone, you can NOT make any noises\", to which I reply, \"not even (referencing the noise I made, which wasn't really a word, more of a sigh-ish sound) kind of noise?\"  \"No, not a sound\", she says.  I get a little more irritated by this point, thinking to myself, if I had to make calls and couldn't have any external noises, I would surely do it elsewhere.  I say, \"well, babe, can you go work in the bedroom (she has a small desk and stool in there) so you can work in peace?\"  She gives me this look of pure ignorance and I can already sense what she is going to say.  \"FUCK you\" has never rolled off of a tongue so naturally.  She scoops up all of her material and storms into the bedroom.  She has been in there, working and most likely fuming on the situation (as I am, hence this post), for roughly 2 hours now and completely avoids eye contact and conversation in the minimal moments that she exits the bedroom.  Reddit, I need to know.  Am I the asshole for suggesting what would be a win-win situation for both of us?  &#x200B;  Edit:  To clarify, I do work a full time job (military).  We have such a tiny apartment because the housing market in this area is outrageous at the moment, and also because it was the only apartment complex I could find that would allow pit bulls.  We tried for a 2 or 3 bedroom, but the 1 bed/1 bath was all they had available.\n",
      "So my boyfriend (26m) and I (24f) have been pretty bored recently. We were on a zoom call when a friend of ours brought up the idea of the \"freebie list\" - aka the five people you can cheat on your SO with. Obviously, this isn't actually real and I don't think any couple takes it seriously.  &#x200B;  But we were both bored so we decided to have a laugh and create our own freebie lists while both acknowledging that this was just a fantasy and that neither of us would cheat on each other. My freebie list was pretty normal but when I saw his, I noticed a pattern.  &#x200B;  Four of his five were Asian or of Asian descent. I starting thinking about all of his previous girlfriends that I know of from his middle-school girlfriend to the one before me and realized I'm the first white woman he's ever dated (which his friends later confirmed for me). I kind of jokingly called him out on his yellow fever which he got really offended at and he said he's not some \"creepy fetishist looking for a submissive Asian wife.\"  &#x200B;  This started a huge argument where he got really angry and refused to speak to me. This is where I may be a bit of the AH in that I didn't really take it seriously and made jokes about it which just made him angrier. Obviously, I'm not offended that he's had yellow fever in the past - he's dating me now and I'm secure enough to know he's not going to cheat on me.   Instead of my normally awesome boyfriend, he's turned into this sulking mess who refuses to talk to me.  So, AITA?\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have been dating for 7 years. I’m in college and unfortunately fractured my foot and I’m on crutches. Because of this I cannot drive. This weekend I thought I was going to be at college so I planned my weekend here.   Back home I have a huge friend group, but all of them are guys. My bf is in the friend group too. This Friday, they have planned a bar crawl.   I wasn’t too keen on my bf going to a bar without me anyways. We also are the type of people to not go clubbing. We agreed we would never go clubbing. I find out one of the bars they are going to is a club. They are also traveling 25 minutes out of town to a better area for bar hopping. Meaning they are all going to be packed of females. He is one of the only guys in a relationship in this group. So for him to go bar hopping and clubbing with single guys just seems off to me. But they are his friends. But he also just started drinking so it just seems so different to me.   Yesterday I find out I’m coming home. And that it is a bar crawl and I cannot go because it’s boys only. Because they are my only friends back home, and I cannot drive, I will be left at home by myself.   I’m upset because I obviously want to be having fun, but also it’s just a boys night so I am always left out, even though I am the only female.   So am I the asshole for not wanting my boyfriend to go?\n",
      "Hi, I (17M) have my stepdad's cousin's birthday coming up soon and it happens to fall on the same day as my dad's birthday. My parents are divorced and I go to my dad's every other weekend. I love my dad and I am very close with my stepdad and his family. I do, however, have issues with my stepmom that I won't go into too many details about.  Anyway, my stepdad has a cousin that my mom, stepdad, and I are close to. We tend to spend the day before Christmas Eve with them and are going to go to their daughter's wedding soon. He is celebrating his 50th and the family is throwing him a surprise party. I really want to go to that party and I'm planning on baking him a cake as a gift from our family and everything. I also knew my stepmom would probably plan something for my dad's birthday I just didn't know what it would be. I had just found out about the surprise party when my stepmom called and told me she had surprise plans for the day before his birthday and the day after before they would take me back home that night.   I was asking if they would be able to get me back home before a certain time hoping I could do both. I asked my mom cause I didn't know what to do and she and my stepdad told me I could propose that I spend the day with my dad the day before his birthday and then have them drop me off after or spend the night at my dad's and them drop me off at home before the party. That way I could spend time the day before and on his birthday. I was planning on getting my dad a gift and maybe baking him something to give to him the day before as his gift and calling him (because he jokes around with me because he knows I don't call people on the phone very often because it's uncomfortable for me) and wishing him a happy birthday and everything.  I just feel like me celebrating with him the day before and spending the day with him still shows that I appreciate and love him even if I also want to celebrate another birthday with unfortunate timing with someone else. I don't know, my stepmom just told me off and basically called me an AH for my decision. I have had issues in the past with her regarding how I show my appreciation for my dad, among multiple other things, especially because our personalities are very different. I'm thinking I'll just not go to the party and stay with my dad to avoid making her upset.   I guess its not as much of an AITA as it is AIAAH (Am I An A**hole)\n",
      "Hi everyone I recently sold an extremely expensive Wacom Cintiq (1500 when I bought it) for an extremely low price ($200) and have been waiting for my money to be taken off hold. Last night the buyer messaged me and said that they couldn't get that tablet to calibrate and that if she couldn't figure it out they would have to return it. I've never had this issue with the tablet, or any issues at all. I've never even needed to calibrate that thing once it always just kind of worked. The only reason I sold it was because it was too bulky and I couldn't get a lot of use out of it and I would have rather had an Ipad because it suits my needs better.  The problem is I kind of need this money, I'm in debt to my parents. I mentioned that I was selling the tablet to buy myself an Ipad for school next year and for art and they offered to lend me the money so I could buy it during the labor day sale and I would pay them back once the tablet sold. The site I sold it on has a strange policy on refunds saying that it's completely up to the seller if they issue refunds. The tablet the buyer got wasnt different than described and it wasn't broken I even threw in a computer bag that fits the tablet because the actual bags are overpriced. I wouldn't be in legal trouble or in trouble with the app if I didn't issue it the most I'd get it a bad review and I don't really plan on selling any other things on this app (too much of a pain). Plus I'm sure the buyer would want me to cover the costs of her sending it back to me. WIBTA if I just didn't issue her a refund seeing as the issue she's having with it is minor?\n",
      "I’ll try to keep this brief. A girl I’m casual friends with recently posted on FB that she’s in a relationship. The girl and I have never been close, but we’ve always been on good terms and used to run in the same circles. If we randomly saw each other out, we’d definitely say hi and hug but probably wouldn’t chat long and wouldn’t make plans to immediately catch up.  I saw from her post that her new boyfriend is someone I know, and when I knew him (around 8 years ago) he was not a nice person and was incredibly racist. The boyfriend was friends with one of my guy friends and would always try to tag along with us at parties, but his behavior was so heinous I put my foot down. He has told horrible racists jokes in front of me on various occasions—some of them graphic, involving the torture or even hanging of POC. My friend, his new girlfriend, is mixed race. I was surprised and horrified to see that was her boyfriend. I said aloud that I should probably warn her, and my partner balked at the idea. He said 8 years is a long time and that people change. This is true—I’m a markedly different person from who I was 8 years ago, and he might be too. It’s also possible that she is already aware of his past since our various social circles used to have some overlap. But a small part of me can’t help but feel concerned. WIBTA if I told her what I know? Should I just move on and mind my own business?\n",
      "I know this probably wasn’t my proudest moment, but AITA for this?  My husband and I had to move 6 months ago. We have a newborn, and id just gotten off maternity leave. In that time, our toddler broke his leg and couldn’t be taken care of at daycare because of it, so I had to take unpaid leave from work. Between moving expenses and that we’ve been very very short the last few months.   DH pays his ex child support. She married a rich guy after they got divorced and she doesn’t work anymore, she “works” part time at an art gallery and part time unpaid at a dog rescue now. My step daughters are 10, 13 and 16. Their stepfather doesn’t have any kids and spoils the shit out of them. Literally he bought a car to be used by her for the 16 year olds birthday and the 13 year old is going to Portugal for a school trip this summer all on his dime. I know for a fact the child support just goes into a college fund for them.  I literally had to pawn an old iPhone so our 7 year old didn’t miss a class field trip because we couldn’t pay. My husband hasn’t been able to make support because of all this shit in 6 months. I get it, it’s bad and I’m not making excuses.   Well without even telling us, his ex filed with the court saying he’s not paying. He called her and she didn’t pick up then she called back and he had run out to his car. I answered it and I’ll admit I lost it a bit. I asked her how another mother could be so selfish when she knew we were in a rough patch, that it’s unfair her child support is so much when she’s choosing not to work (that’s why he owes so much) and eventually said she’s a heartless bitch. She said he still needs to support his daughters even though he’s “having kids he clearly can’t afford” then hung up.   DH was mad at me but has calmed down and said I was just being a mama bear and now he’s pissed his ex said that about our kids. I’m just worried it’ll hurt him in court if she brings up that we had a fight. AITA?\n",
      "Around 8 years ago (right at the beginning of my husband's amd my relationship) I found out that a childhood friend of mine was serving a 21 year sentence in a state prison. His sister told me he was depressed and would probably appreciate a letter, so I started writing him letters occaisionally. My husband knew all about this and we would sometimes joke about me having a prison pen pal. I've never not let my husband read my letters to him or from him.  We have kept in touch throughout the years and recently he started being able to call me somewhat regularly (weekly?). At first I used to take the calls outside but that bothered my husband. Now i take the calls in front of my husband but my husband gets upset pretty much every time we talk on the phone.   In my mind he's a close friend in need of friends. He's honestly funny and smart and we get along. He always asks about my husband and our son and we talk about general stuff. He's never asked me for anything except to send pictures,  which I do, usually of me and my husband and our son and cats. Pretty standard stuff. I don't answer every time he calls and I never talk negatively about my husband to him.   In my husband's opinion he thinks my friend probably has some kind of romantic interest in me and sees me as a sort of \"light at the end of the tunnel.\"  He also thinks our conversations are flirty. For example the other day my friend asked what I was doing that was making so much noise and when I said I was cooking he asked if I'm a good cook.   AITA for wanting to keep in contact with my friend even though my husband is uncomfortable with it?\n",
      "To make a long story short, my uncle who also happens to be my godfather ended a 4 year long battle with melanoma this on Friday morning.  I’m in the military and took emergency leave the prior weekend once I learned he was in hospice care, because not only is he my uncle, he’s my godfather, my dads identical twin, and has always been a second father to me. Him passing might as well be the equivalent of my dad passing away.  My wife was fine originally, and she was glad I was going but sad she couldn’t tag along because of her work. I told her it’s not a big deal, she’ll be there in spirit and love. I fly home, everything is fine.  About midway through the week she begins to lose her shit because I’m not talking to her enough or FaceTiming long enough for her when I’m at home. I could have definitely talked to her more, but the majority of my time was spent consoling my father who was watching his identical twin pass away.   Friday morning, he passed away. My dad is an absolute fucking wreck and it kills me to see him like this. I’ve never seen him cry before and he’s bawling his eyes out and completely devastated. My wife tells me now that my uncle is dead, I should come home early to be with her again. This really pisses me off and I get irritated and visibly upset with her on FaceTime and she tells me she has to go.   She stops texting me, won’t answer my phone calls, and only responds “love you” when I tell her “I love you”. Haven’t heard much from her all weekend.  I fly back today, and she tells me she’s not getting me from the airport and I have to take a Lyft. She tells me this, mind you, when I’m already on the plane and she promised me she would pick me up.   I’m on my way home right now but when I get home, I’m considering going to a friends house for a few days. This was a major death in our family and she was only concerned with herself the entire trip. I get that it’s because she misses me and wants me to be home, but this was absolutely ridiculous. She never did anything mean or cussed me out or anything, just stopped responding and became very distant. I’m super pissed and don’t want to talk to her at all tonight.  Am I the asshole here? I don’t mean to paint her in a bad light at all, because I definitely could have communicated better this trip, but I don’t know how to handle this. Perhaps this would be better x-posted into relationship advice?  Thank you all in advance.\n",
      "I (16F) have an older brother (19M) who's away at college currently. We lost our dad fairly young (8 and 11 y.o.), and I won't lie, it's been hard on all of us. Our mom works really hard to make sure she can provide us with everything we need, and I'll always be grateful for everything she does for us.  I have a classmate with a single mom. His mom and mine are best friends, so he and I spent a lot of time together during our childhood. As we got older we drifted apart a little bit, but I easily still consider him a second brother to me.   Well, it turns out there's now a very real possibility of that happening somewhere down the line. His mom and mine are officially dating. She told me last month and I told her that I'm happy for her, she deserves the world. This is literally the happiest I've seen her in years. We also live in a very LGBT+ friendly area, which I'm grateful for as well.   My brother came home for spring break last week, and my mom broke the news to him, which he took as well as I did (very well). It only went bad when he found out that I've already known for a month. When mom went up to her home office for work, he was pissed that I hadn't told him about it. From what I've read about LGBT+ culture, you don't just out someone without their permission? (correct me if I'm wrong). And either way, I felt like it was my mom's place to tell him about it, not mine. I could've asked her for permission, but the thought just never occurred to me.   She's his mom too, and he said it was unfair that I knew about this much longer than he did. Should I have told him? Or did I make the right call letting my mom be the one to handle it?\n",
      "My parents have been planning this family vacation for over a year. They are thinking that this might be our last family vacation so they are super excited about it. It's going to be just my parents and my siblings. My girlfriend wanted to go but my parents were only able to afford our immediate family.  My girlfriend and I currently live together. She didn't want me to go on this vacation because I would be gone for a week and she would be home alone.  This vacation is coming up within a month and I just found out my girlfriend is pregnant. She's super worried if I were to leave and now I'm so confused on what I should do.  My parents would lose out on a lot of money if I didn't go, but I feel terrible if I were to still go. I wasn't able to go on our last family vacation due to personal issues so I wanted to use this one to spend time with my family.  WIBTA if I were to go on this vacation?\n",
      "So about a year ago my cousin wanted to get out our grandparents house and I just bought my first house. So I told him that he could rent a room from me. I knew he wasn't really able to pay a whole lot in rent. I let him rent at a super cheap rate until he was able to pay a fair amount. Well little did I know that a shit storm of epic proportions would enter into my life once he moved in.   Everything was fine for the first month or so but, then things started to rapidly get much worse. He would always every night go grab milk and spill, literally half the world's supply of milk, on the floor and wouldn't clean it up. He would never do a single dish even when asked, and if by the off chance he decided that he would do a dish, he would basically just rinse the dishes and put them away. Every single time he decided to take a shower he would leave all his clothes all over the floor. Plus when he shaves you sure can bet that he will leave a straight up woolley mammoth all over my toilet, sink and shower. Not even to mention the amount of times I would have to clean up his sh*t after he would machine gun splatter attack my toilet. But to be honest thats not even the worst of it. His room was by far the worst septic tank of a room I have ever seen. There was and shit all over the floor from his cat plus the floor is ruined from cat pee and spilled milk. There is constantly mold under his bed with with enough half eaten baked goods to restock every bakery in the US. The smells that come from his room are so ungodly bad that seriously considered demoing that room down to its bones and redoing it completely once he is gone.   Now sadly there is much more that had gone wrong. He also started selling weed so people would constantly be going in and out of the house. I have extremely bad anxiety and people scare the crap of out me and I come home hoping to get away from those stresses. So asked him if he just tell me if someone is coming inside or not. But he will rarely if ever just tell me that someone is stopping in. So to help with that situation I said he could use my garage for that stuff so it's a bit easier on me. After a month or so of that he pretty much trashed my garage and bunch of stuff that he didn't feel like keeping in there got ruined because he put outside to get rained on.   I have brought up all these issues to him in so many different ways. But nothing seems to work with him he just keeps doing the same stuff. I am just so tired of it, I'm tired of being a maid, I'm tired of taking care of a his animals, I'm tired of doing literally everything with little to no help. It's just so upsetting to see the house I have been working so hard to get since I was 15 years old, get ruined by him.   I want so badly to kick him out and pay for at least some of the damages that he and his animals caused. But like he is my cousin and I feel as if it's wrong of me to kick family out just for being messy. So idk WIBTA?\n",
      "My friend is on antidepressants and is an optimist. I’m an openly political pessimist.  For the past year or so, she has asked me not to discuss political issues (especially climate change) with her because it bums her out. Okay, not a problem. I catered to her wishes and didn’t discuss it with her.  We hang out a lot because I’m very close with her SO. I will be talking to someone completely different and climate change will come up. I’ll express my opinions and the conversation will continue on that topic. My friend will then walk in (let’s call her Smiley), overhear the conversation, and give an exaggerated sigh. I find this intrusive.  Smiley and I will be talking and SHE will bring up climate change or something equally miserable and when I give a response, even an optimistic (although realistic) response, she’ll tell me about how I’m such a downer and I should really think more happy thoughts.  Last summer she informed me that my pessimism makes her not want to be friends with me, and implied that if I weren’t a pessimist she would. She later took this back, but did not apologize.  She has even gone so far as to tell her family that I’m nihilistic and they have emailed my family, expressing “sympathy”.  Smiley’s SO is equally pessimistic, and Smiley has never once criticized them.\n",
      "Using an old throwaway I never threw away, because people on the periphery of the situation know my main.  I know it sounds bad, and it kinda is.   So, I (16f) am having some issues with some school staff, both middle aged women, we'll call them Mary and Rose for this purpose. It's a special needs classroom, but I'm mostly here due to a clerical error and the jobsworths in the office not wanting to deal with the red tape to fix it. Mary and Rose are two of the three classroom aides, the teacher Ms. B spends most of the day in meetings and program planning and doesn't interact much with students, the aides do that. Each of them has certain areas of jurisdiction and certain students they're responsible for. Mary has jurisdiction over the subject I struggle most with, and Rose's assigned third of the class includes me.   Now, neither of these women like me. They make little visible effort to even pretend to like me. It's mostly down to one issue which they've been continually bringing up, which is that they greatly dislike having to converse with me, especially listening to what I say. This is, according to them, entirely because of my voice. They say that there's something wrong with my voice and hearing me speak frays their nerves. I've had them come to answer a question with a notebook and pen in hand, hold up a finger, and tell me I have to write it down because they just can't hear my voice any more this week. They will not tell me what specifically annoys them about my voice, they just ask me to stop causing trouble and speak properly. I have asked other adults in my life, and no one else can tell what could possibly be irritating them about the way I speak. Mary and Rose think I'm an asshole because they've told me that they can't deal with how I speak and \"how difficult is it to speak properly when asked to?\"  Now, you probably think you know where this is going. You are probably wrong. This is happening in Canada. I was born here as were both of my parents. To the best of my knowledge, these ladies were both born here as well. Everyone involved in this situation only speaks English.   So, am I the asshole for not being able to figure out what's wrong with my voice and fix it in order to salvage these working relationships? I think I might be an asshole because I haven't even tried to fix what's wrong with my voice and I'm relying on the persons being hurt by me to tell me what needs to be fixed.\n",
      "I (F35) am married to Jack(M41) for a little over a year and together for over 3 years. Together we have Tia(F1). I have Ilia(F8) from my previous marriage. Jack has Mike (M11)from his previous marriage. Mike has an older half brother Rob(M15) who Jack did help raise for the first few years of his life and who he did continue to see after he divorced his ex wife. The reason for their divorce was due to infidelity on her end throughout the time they were engaged and the one year they were married including when she was pregnant with Mike. Mike and Rob do not always have the best relationship and in my opinion goes well beyond normal sibling rivalry. Recently Mike has been spending more time at our home, including a year and a half that he was primarily with us due to some issues with his mother, during this time Mike was undergoing weekly counseling and therapy to help him with the anger he was feeling and the numerous life changes he was undergoing. Mike has told us that Rob is a trigger for his anger and anxiety so we told him that our home is his safe place and his brother does not have to come over unless he is ok with it. Recently Mike and Rob had an extended weekend with us, because their mother was going out of town and Rob did not want to stay with his grandparents. Everything was going well, but Rob started harassing Mike along with Ilia. We told him if he needed a break away from the younger kids that’s fine, but he shouldn’t be treating anyone the way he was especially an 8 year old and an 11 year old. He then made comments about Ilia’s father which is a sore subject with her, because he often bails on her. He also mentioned to Ilia that Jack is not her father and she shouldn’t call him dad.   It also should be noted in the year that Mike was living with primarily myself and Jack that Rob also made similar comments to Mike that he shouldn’t call me “mom”, because I’m not his mother and I won’t last. We told Mike that he can call me whatever he is comfortable with just as long as it wasn’t derogatory or an insult; same with Ilia and what she wanted to call Jack.  After two days of the extended weekend Mike came up to myself and Jack and made sure he was staying the two extra days like he was promised. We told him of course unless he wanted to go back to his mothers. He said no, but he didn’t want Rob to stay. Jack spoke with him privately and then called his ex and discussed it with her. His ex did come and pick up Rob, who ended up being very upset and was cursing and crying. He kept stating “it wasn’t fair and if it wasn’t for her and her daughters I could have stayed.” Obviously I’m the her he was speaking of and if he wants to blame me I’m fine with that so that way he doesn’t blame his younger brother. I just want to know if aita for keeping the promise to Mike that our home is is safe place and having his older half brother leave.  ***edited the initials to names for clarity and easier reading.\n",
      "Brief background: I am a moderator on a fairly large venting server of over 2000 members on discord. We help people with their struggles, listen to their vents and give advice, including talking them out of self death.  I have been in this position for few weeks now but I was a stafd (a position lower than mod a bit) and have been in this server for more than half a yeae so I know it fairly well.  So onto the situation: there is this person who joined the server and starts talking bad things about Canada that are obviously false even by the glance of it.   Their message: https://imgur.com/a/HOzLLin  As I am a Canadian, I felt really pissed at that and decided to make a counter argument (which was later removed by somebody else): since the message was long and didnt fit 2000 char limit I drafted them in Docs and still saved them Link  Which the result become them hating on me, and causes a backlash. The remaining staff team still supports me and the most logical thing to do is to mesaage them an apology. But I chickened out and temporarily left the server. So there it goes...\n",
      "I met this girl and after a year, we became really good friends. One night I was staying over at her place and that day I had a really heated argument with my parents so I started venting about how tired I was of my life and how I wanted all of it to end. In the morning I left her house and went to school only to know that she hadn't shown up and one of our mutual friends told me that he sympathises with me.  I called my friend and asked her why she did that and then she tried to explain how she was really worried about my situation and didn't want me to do anything stupid ever so she told it to our friend over text because she needed to let it all out for some reason. Even though it doesn't sound like that big of a deal, I just didn't want anyone else to know about my pathetic condition and I didn't trust our other friend to keep the secret. So I told my friend to leave me alone and not talk to me because I was hurt and felt betrayed. She tried to talk to me multiple of times, she bought a gift for my birthday and asked our friend to tell me to come take it but I really didn't want to see her so I said no. After a week, she encountered a car accident and succumbed to her injuries.  I didn't get to talk things, or forgive her or just let her have the satisfaction of knowing that I wasn't mad at her before she passed away and now when I think about it I just feel really terrible.  I like to believe I am the asshole for cutting all ties with her over a seemingly small matter.\n",
      "I’m on mobile, so sorry for any formatting errors.   This happened a few years ago, but my siblings felt like I was being ungrateful, and I still struggle with whether or not I was wrong for being upset.   Context: Senior year of high school, a group of about 10 friends including me and my two siblings (I am a triplet with a brother and a sister) participated in a secret santa. Everyone drew a random two names from a cup, and the price limit was like $15. So, everyone got two gifts essentially.   The day of the exchange comes. We all sit in a circle and go around with everyone opening their gifts. The gift givers reveal themselves. So far, while all of the gifts had been small, they were thoughtful. Like getting someone a candy they really liked or a personalized mug or something to that effect. It is then my turn. I find out one of my two secret santas was my brother. He didn’t have anything for me, so he searched through his wallet and found an unused $10 iTunes gift card he hadn’t redeemed and gave it to me. I was crushed. I was so hurt. He didn’t see the problem. I told him that he shouldn’t have agreed to participate if he wasn’t going to be serious about it. It got kind of awkward at that point as I was just bummed out the rest of the time.   So, AITA for being upset at my brother?\n",
      "My brother (22M) recently took custody of our sister (16F). I (21M) am not officially guardian or anything, but my brother and I were already roommates before this arrangement, so I’m still around and help out. We’ve all had trouble getting used to this new arrangement, my sister mostly with being told what to do by me and my brother. My brother has definitely taken more of the parenting role and he’s mostly the one telling her what to do. They fight all the time. They fight about her curfew, her taking the car, who she’s hanging out with (she’s always off with some boy or another). I usually try to be the middle man and calm them down, but still I usually take my brother’s side. However, they recently got into an argument because she wants to quit dance. My brother has it in his head that her dancing will help her get into college, that it’s a good activity to keep her busy and in shape, and he told her that she wasn’t allowed to quit. I thought he was being a little ridiculous, if she doesn’t want to dance, why force her, especially since it can be pretty expensive. After I took her side, though, my brother blew up at me, told me to quit undermining him, and that if I am not going to take his side, then I should move out. I feel like he’s going overboard, and it’s not fair for him to try to kick me out (when I am paying rent and helping out) over this. I feel like I have the right to take my sister’s side if I truly agree with her. It’s not like my brother and I are married or parents. He seems to think that I need to take his side on everything. AITA?\n",
      "Hey, first time poster! I’ve just been having this dilemma internally recently. My best friend has an awful track record with guys. She ignores huge red flags and I am the one who is inevitably there for her when she gets hurt. She’s recently started seeing this guy and alarm bells are ringing in my head. On the first night we all hung out as a group he tried to kiss a mutual friend after we had all gone to bed. After grafting on my friend the entire night. She’s chosen to ignore this and all power to her.   I know she’s going to get hurt again and I don’t think I can honestly be there for her again. It’s exhausting and I don’t have the mental capacity right now personally to cope with this. The only reason I feel like I might be the asshole if I was to tell her to not discuss this relationship with me is that I feel like friends are meant to be there unconditionally to support.   Sooo, WIBTA?\n",
      "This occurred earlier today. I was at Overpriced Coffee Shop, sitting in an arc of four sofa chairs. There's another person sitting to my right, leaving the chairs at the ends of the arc empty. There were plenty of tables empty elsewhere in the shop.  I was listening to an audio book AND very obviously actively engaged in a mobile game (phone screen can be seen by everyone at a glance) when a man sits down to my left. He immediately tries to converse with me. I didn't hear him at first, but I eventually catch sight of the orientation of his body and that he's gesturing at me. I discreetly lower the volume on my book. He's trying to ask me about the weather.   I got a weird feeling. I justified it then by telling myself that a stranger trying so hard to get another stranger's attention about the weather is being weird, especially when one party is otherwise distracted. Now I'm not sure.   Was I an asshole for ignoring him?  We did end up in the same Hospitality Grocery Store an hour later. Again, I had my earphones in. Again, he tried to engage me. This time, he physically got in my way, so I couldn't just pretend he wasn't there. When I took out my earphones, he asked me if I had a boyfriend. I told him to leave me alone. I feel justified in  that  course of action.   I'm unsure of my actions in Overpriced Coffee Shop, though.   TL;DR Stranger tries really hard to get me talking while I'm listening to audio book. I ignore him because I thought he was behaving strangely. Was I being the asshole?\n",
      "My shelf in the fridge was empty, so the new tenant put their shopping in it. I wasn't annoyed about it, but I wanted to continue using the shelf I've used since living there. So I simply moved their shopping to the spare shelf used by the tenant they replaced, and put mine on my shelf. The exact thing happened to me when I moved in and inadvertently used someone else's shelf. The new tenant is making a massive deal out of it, so AITA? I should mention it's just a random house, none of us really know eachother and everyone keeps to themselves.\n",
      "Throwaway because people know my main account. I know how the title sounds, but hear me out.  My boyfriend and I are both grad students, and are both into gaming - I'm actually more of a gamer than he is, so ordinarily I have no issue if he chooses to game for hours. I've done it too.  My problem is that he knowingly starts video games when we're on a time crunch. Take today for example - it's finals week, and I have a major research paper due in two days. He has to drive to his place (40 miles away) today to drop off rent, and we have to pick up groceries. Knowing all this, he started a game when I was in the washroom and then refused to close it midway. I asked him why he couldn't have gotten dressed in the meantime, and he just shrugged. I reminded him that I really had to write my paper, and he snapped at me saying it was a non-issue and that it was an online cards game and I needed to learn to be more patient.  I feel like I have the right to be pissed because he knows how difficult this paper is for me, and as I pointed out I would never delay him if the roles were reversed. I told him he needs to sort out priorities, and that a grad school final takes precedence over a game of hearts. He says I'm overreacting and that we \"only got delayed by 10 minutes\". AITA?\n",
      "On mobile and normally a lurker, please forgive formatting.   This is a weird story, but it comes up often with my friends and I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.   So I was out with a friend (both female) at a small store. Besides us, there was another woman with her significant other and we kept running into them while looking around. She was wearing a sun dress that showed off her tattoos on her arms and legs, all of which were in one particular style and probably all done by the same artist.  When at the cash register paying, I notice one of her legs is prosthetic and she had someone paint it in the same style as all her other tattoos. I thought that was super cool and I am one of those types to complement strangers on stuff I notice without thinking (nothing weird, just shoes or hair or whatever), so I told her that I liked her leg. I didn't really think anything of it.   As we were leaving, my friend said that was shitty of me to say. But I really did like it so I'm confused.\n",
      "I met my girlfriend a few years back, we started out as roommates and friends. Then we had a falling out with the landlord and got our own place since we didn't want to live with strangers. Around the same time she was diagnosed with cancer.  She's a great person and I really and truly was just trying to help her thru a difficult situation and help get her independence back. We were in our mid 40s at the time. Her daughter was very independent and dependable so she moved with us. To make a long story shorter 5 yrs later she's still battling cancer and we are a couple now, even talked about getting married.   The problem is she expects me to help her kids financially from time to time..most of the time even the ones who dont live with us and the daughter who lives with us has become very undependable and we count on her for a share of the rent. Did I mention she also moved in her adult son who has schizophrenia and is a severe alcoholic with legal issues. Who she enables with my paycheck behind my back.   Basically am I the asshole for wanting to focus on her and expecting her kids to manage they're own problems. I'm not their father and they have no problem sticking me with the Bill's when paying is inconvenient.  I expect nothing from them since from what I've seen they put themselves first and her second. I dont want to pay their Bill's, buy their groceries,  or pay for their smokes when they went and pissed their money away. All our financial problems are due to her inability to show them tough love. I get that they had a rough child hood and she had an abusive husband, but that's no excuse to treat me the way they do. I'm working 2 jobs 65 hrs a week to make ends meet and still can't catch up. I make over 78,000 at one job and the other job brings in 300 a week extra.   I'm put my foot down, took a stand a few days ago.  I know she's not well , especially lately and she's making impulsive emotional decisions,  but if we continue her way we will lose the house and it will ruin me financially. I know there's more important things than money, but money buys, food, shelter and stability. That's all I want for us.  Her son is a high functioning schizophrenic, he's not dumb or incapable of taking care of himself he just wont and she enables him. Putting a roof over his head and a house full of groceries is enough. I dont have to do more than that.   On a side note, because of all this I have carried around the same debt I had when I met her. It gotten worse for sure.  I thought we could sort all these issues out and make a life. I think I might have to move on, but she has no income and I wont leave her homeless. I'm thinking we should go back to being friends so I can reset boundaries with her kids and we can all eventually move on. I dont have 40 more working years left in me.   Am I The Ahole?\n",
      "Okay, I know the title is a complete champagne problem but please hear me out.   My s/o and I live very busy lifestyles which often results in us ordering dinner through DoorDash 3-4 times a week. Getting DashPass (A $9.99 monthly charge to relieve any delivery/extra fees) is not something I wanted to commit to until today. While ordering tonight, I offer to use my app because I just purchased DashPass and would save us significant money on our order. My s/o responds “Oh. I’ve had that for months. So it doesn’t really matter.”   It’s important to mention that we have been in a committed relationship for 5+ years and live together. We split everything down the middle in terms of finances. I have never known they have had DashPass as they’ve never once mentioned it to me. We alternate who orders each time. I got upset because I could’ve just sent money to them through another third party app for dinner on my night to pay, and we could’ve just ordered through my s/o’s app to save money. While it might sound dumb, if you use DoorDash you know the fees are insane and add up quickly. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on fees where I didn’t have to because all along they have paid for DashPass. My s/o stated “It’s not my responsibility to tell you whether or not I have it. You should’ve just bought it yourself.”  AITA for getting upset?\n",
      "I (22M) have an older brother (27M) who's been dating this girl (around same age) for quite some time. My brother wasn't as lucky in the gene pools as me and he isn't someone you'd consider conventionally attractive. He's a good guy, just not lucky with girls or dating in general. Well, his girlfriend is blind (and also the hottest girl my brother has managed to pick up) and yesterday they've had a family gathering to announce that she's pregnant. While it wasn't a planned pregnancy, they do plan to keep the baby.  My brother's gf started saying how lucky she is that she'd found a man like my brother, as most men she'd met were only interested in having sex with her and didn't want to be tied down to a blind person and I made a joke about how most women wouldn't even look at my brother, so he's also just as lucky that he found someone like her. I thought people would laugh at my joke, but instead it just created an awkward atmosphere and my brother just looked embarrassed. Soon enough the gathering ended and my parents approached me to say that I was out of line with what I said about my brother, especially knowing how much he struggled with insecurity issues when it comes to his looks and that I should apologize to him for ruining such a celebratory moment for him. I don't understand how my joke could've ruined my brother's moment, especially cause I've always made jokes about his looks an he'd always laugh them off, but my parents insist I apologize to him for what I said at the gathering.  AITA or are my parents just overreacting ?  Edit: Spelling.\n",
      "So I(me) was in line at the gas station (SE:station employee) just now, me and my coworker (GOG:grumpyolderguy) was behind me with no one else in store.

SE: No Gas.  Me: 5 gallons.  SE: How much does that cost.  Me: (laughing thinking she was kidding me) probably an arm and a leg, but the boss is paying so i get to keep mine.  GOG: DONT BE AN ASS SALTINWOUNDNEEDED. PEOPLE ARE WAITING.  ME: Um...(still only us in store) Sorry, i just need 5 gallons if you have a calculator i guess i could figure it out.  SE: Dont you have a cell phone?  Me: (visably confused) uh its in the truck...  SE: Ok then, next in line please.  Me: WTF?   SE: Sir please step out of line till you figure out how much you need.   Me: shit just gimme 11$ and ill come back for change.  SE: that wont be enough.  Me: what would be enough?  SE: (disgusted with me) I told you i dont know.  Me: shit ma'am at this point i dont think it matters i just want gas and to leave.  GOG: (Angry now) LET ME PAY FOR MY SHIT I CANT BELIEVE YOU, QUIT BEING SO DAMN DIFFICULT  SE: (looks past me) what can i get for you sir.  Me: Just gimme my dip and 11$ in gas first, im not sure what the problem is?  SE: (rolls eyes and rings it up)  (Me and GOG leave, hes been bitching at me for 2 hrs now about how ignorant people my age are and how he cant believe how difficult and entitled I was acting and how if i ever go in another store hes not going in with me.)  Im seriously confused, i know i dont always read social situations the best. AITA? Hes treating me like i did something unbelievable.  Edit. Lemme give you some back story. I was in the store for some dip and GOG was getting a water. ONLY 2 PEOPLE IN STORE or parking lot the ENTIRE time.  Boss calls while im in store and says \"fill up that 5 gallon can while your there.\" We werent even at the pump yet. Theres no sign visable  with the by the gallon price anywhere except strait up on a sign you cant see from the ground but can see over the trees on the interstate, maybe from the road. But not from the store. So yeah you tell me how you would of done it?   Everyone else, thanks im avoiding that store like the plague. I felt guilty after GOG hounded me but today he was naturally an ass about everything and i realized this will be a daily thing with him so i just quit talking to him completely and turn up the radio when we have to go anywhere. Have a good one guys.\n",
      "I am part of a giving group on FB that is all about giving those who need something a thing you currently have and don't find useful. We have a few kitchen appliances that haven't been put to use in years or have been replaced by upgrades (toaster oven, electric griddle, small crockpot).   I would like to offer them to my community at large via the FB group I'm a part of. My SO wants to give these items to his brother. His brother and I have had a falling out months ago when he made disparaging political and racial remarks in our home. When I called him out on these remarks he moved towards me like he was going to attack. He has not apologized. He isn't financially stable, has 3 children to care for and isn't working at the moment.   I'm not sure if I'm being spiteful (I've never liked him) but I truly don't think he deserves these items compared to needy community members. I feel like giving him free things when he hasn't apologized in 4 months is rewarding his behavior just because he has responsibilities and is poor.  My SO claims I have \"hate in my heart\" and I need to look past my dislike of his brother and give him these things to help him care for his kids.   For reference, I am also poor and was trying initially to sell these things for a few bucks to pay off some debt but after weeks of unsuccessful FB Mrktplc ads I have decided to gift them to my community to de-clutter my home. These items belong to my partner and I, he is very on board with decluttering our home of unused, unloved items.   Anyway, AITA?\n",
      "I (15f) blew up on my family today. My family consists of Stepmom and my dad and my two half siblings (they're both under 5)   Anyhow, before I woke up, I heard my dad and SM shouting at each other. Basically, they just had my half sister, and my dad previously didn't want to be on the birth certificate because things were not working out between them. They're not married either.   My SM was crying about him not being in the birth cert and they were having a lot of fights so I thought i should help out.   I talked my dad into signing it so that the baby can stay in the country and then can get a passport. (my SM is from another country)  Today my SM apparently was calling up to change the surname of the baby. Which is why they were shouting at each other.   I had spent so much effort into trying to convince my dad for my SM and i felt enraged that she dared to change the surname of my half sister. She said she doesn't want to be a part of his family because they never invite her for anything. In reality, we don't have family here since my grandpa died 3 years back.   She said she wanted my half sister to have her parents name since they care for them much more than my dad's \"family.\" i blew up on her saying if they cared about her so much she should go live with them. Her family hates my dad and whenever anyone's arguing she always brings up how much better they are than my dad. I also felt hurt because my mom left me with my little sister because of her and my dad cheating on her and i never got to complain that i want to go back to my mom's side of the family.   &#x200B;  AITA?\n",
      "My (29F) niece (11F) was baptized today. Everyone in my immediate family is Christian, with various levels of intensity. On a scale from 1-5, my parents are 3, my older sister is a 2, and my oldest sister (mother of my niece) is a 5. I, on the other hand, am pagan, and have been for over ten years now. My parents raised us with the mindset of \"They will develop whatever religious beliefs they feel comfortable with when they get older\", so we never went to church as kids. I am incredibly grateful to my parents. I attended half a dozen different types of churches as a teen, and after several years decided it was not the religion for me and moved on.   I've never asked my family to participate in my religion. Never asked them to celebrate my holidays with me, I celebrate them alone. I've certainly NEVER brought up my beliefs around my nieces, as I know it would upset my sister. I've never argued to my family about their beliefs nor tried to convince them to join mine. I keep my opinions to myself.   Despite all that, my oldest sister never stopped trying to convert me. She invites me to her church services all the time, despite me turning down the invitations for a decade now. She tells me I shouldn't be offended when other people try to convert me, because it is their job as Christians to do so. (I've been specifically targeted and harassed by both strangers and coworkers because I wear a pentacle on occasion).   Anyway, today my niece was baptized. Everyone in the family was invited to attend the church service, then the baptism, then a lunch afterwards. I decided I would skip the church and head straight to the lunch, because I am super uncomfortable sitting through church services. I asked my mom if she would know when the church parts would be wrapped up, and then I would head over for lunch and family time.   Well apparently this did not sit well with my sister, as she sent me a very passive aggressive text last night saying how disappointed she was in me for not planning on attending the service today. I'll be honest, I thought up a dozen different replies. Some petty, some funny, some logical, and some just mean. But in the end I didn't reply to her at all, I just decided not to go at all. I told my mom what happened, so she wouldn't be worried when I didn't turn up, and she said it was my sister's own fault for being pushy again.   My oldest sister is pissed that I didn't turn up, obviously. Our middle sister says I should have just sucked it up and gone to keep the peace.   So, Reddit, AITA?\n",
      "A bit of context I’m preparing for my driving test in Canada at roughly 3 pm as I would avoid the rush and it’s kinda close to me test time. I’m minding my business and following the speed limit. Not once but twice truckers are riding my ass and honking at me despite going at the absolute limit allowed. Multiple times I refused to run a yellow that’s turning red really soon and got honked at. AITA for following the rules ?\n",
      "Before we dive in, let's just say that I do in general think he has some nice clothes, and I would never stop him dressing the way he likes. However, he has some trousers which I hate, and he absolutely loves.   These trousers were bought for work, and are best described as \"smart cargo trousers\" in that they're tough, practical and have a million pockets, but if he needs to wear a shirt with them he can get away with it.   That's great, but he wears them a lot at home, often with those breathable sports t shirts. Again, he can wear what he likes and I have never criticised it until he asked for my opinion on a new pair of jeans. When I said they were great and meant he didn't have to wear those cargo trousers all the time, he got upset. He feels that I'm the asshole for criticising the way he dresses. I don't think I am because I haven't said anything until now, and was honest when asked what I thought. I was really clear that I will never stop him dressing however he likes, but I much prefer the jeans, especially if we're going out for the evening or something similar.  My SO was keen that I get the wisdom of Reddit. So all, AITA?  Edit: Thanks, there's been a real mix of responses here. It's definitely made me think on it, and I think I ATA for the way I gave my opinion, but NTA for having a preference? I'll apologise for how I went about it, and ask nicely if the cargo trousers can be worn a bit less!\n",
      "Some background: My SIL has had a rough time the last few years, too many incidents to really relate, suffice to say it's been rough and not many people have been in her corner. She's asked for some time for me to see about getting her an ebike to give her some extra mobility. It took awhile, but I found one for her, and got her set up with it, including a lock and everything she'd need. It cost me some money, but I never told her what it cost or asked repayment for it.  She's had it for 5-6 months, when she tells me that she's not really using it because she's afraid of traffic when riding it. I was fine with that, if you're not comfortable on it, you probably shouldn't be on it. But then she springs that she wants me to sell it for her, and split the money with her.  And this is where I'm torn. I can find a buyer for it, I'm very confident of that at this point, but she paid nothing for it, has neglected the maintenance of it, and I'm likely going to have to correct issues with the bike, but she still expects have the proceeds from the sale of it. Most of her share would be chewed up in replacing the batteries that she's not cared for, and she's made no effort really on her part, just expecting me to handle everything and share the money with her.  WIBTA is I made the sale and just kept the money on the ebike that I bought, gifted and then reclaimed?\n",
      "Ok! So I have been struggling with feeling like the asshole here. I (27F) have been in a loving polyamorous relationship with my partner (30M) for a couple years. Recently I met a new person (30M), let's call him Wallace, and quickly became quite infatuated with him. We went on several fun dates and chatted daily about our interests, kinks, life goals, the whole shebang. I was feeling really comfortable and safe with Wallace and after some negotiating we agreed to a sleepover at his place and to have our first sexy times (woohoo!).   However, that's where my excitement ended.. When I got to his place I found it to be dark, dirty, empty walls and gross furniture, mattress on the floor, etc. It looked like a college apartment. Then, he introduced me to his dog, a rescue dog who is extremely nervous. I'm not blaming the dog at all, but from the second I walked in the door she wouldn't stop barking at me, and she is a big dog, also acting like she was nipping at my hands. I couldn't even go to the bathroom without her barking continuously outside the door. I was getting uncomfortable at this point, but we retired to his room and I thought, \"Ok! Rough start, but let's have a good fun sexy time!\" I wanted to be in the moment and enjoy getting to explore this person's body for the first time, but that dog barked literally every second we were having sex. The whole time non-stop. We make dinner, to dog barking at me. We went on a walk, the dog barked at me, we came back and started to wind down to go to bed but the dog wouldn't sleep unless it was in the room with us and she kept coming up to me in the night and just staring at me and if I moved she'd start barking and growling. I felt paralyzed. I realized at about 4 am that I was having a panic attack because I felt trapped, I couldn't move or leave without the dog barking more and I was exhausted and stressed. I stayed just frozen in panic for hours. eventually Wallace moved, looked over and realizing I was awake asked if I was ok. I felt like the interaction unfroze me suddenly and I just stammered I had to leave, that I had a nice time with him but that I had to go immediately and I quickly got up and gathered my things and left.   Since that incident, I just don't find Wallace attractive to me. It was like a lightswitch and I've never had that happen before. Am I the asshole for just flat out losing interest in him because of this? I feel like I built of so much hope and interest in our future and now that is all just gone on my end. I communicated with him that I was no longer interested, and he's really hurt and blindsided but honestly so am I? I really liked him and the feeling is just.... gone suddenly.   TLDR; I was happy and excited about a new relationship with someone, but I lost interest after seeing how he lived and after his dog wouldn't stop barking at me.\n",
      "I was recently in the process of moving out of state, so my sister came over for a visit before I left.   Some backstory: she is the type of person that feels that if somebody isn't doing something the way she would or doesn't agree with her, then they are wrong. Always.  Example: I file fold my laundry when I put it away and she will tell me how I'm doing it all wrong and proceeds to tell me how to do it right \"in order to save space\". She also always follows her advice up with \"I'm not trying to be rude or anything. I'm just trying to help\".   So, as I was packing things up, I already knew a lot of the things wouldn't fit in the car and would have to be mailed up to the new place.  She starts to put her 2 cents in and tells me \"I don't know how you're gonna fit everything in that small car you have. You should really just get more boxes and ship most of your stuff.\" (We don't have a lot of money in order to do this and are only taking what we really need/want and have already packed a huge box full.)  I tell her that we've already planned everything out. She keeps pressing the matter. I let it go.   Eventually, I get to talking about when we get up there and after we have more money when my husband starts his new job, we're going to be ordering some baby furniture (we have a bassinet for her to sleep in and a swing/bouncer, so she isn't without a place to sleep) for our daughter from Rent A Center.  Cue my sister.  S: You know, you're gonna wind up paying more money for that stuff, right?   Me: Yeah, we know. We just can't get everything outright, but she needs to have a crib soon as well as a highchair and a few other things.  S: But it's all name brand stuff. You don't need that! Just go look in discount stores or secondhand shops! I'm not trying to be rude or anything. I just want to save you money.  At this point I've had it because she had been doing this type of thing for weeks off and on and all day that day. So this is how I replied:  Me: Alright, well I'm really done with your advice. You say you're not being rude and trying to help, but you are forcing your personal opinions on me and its pissing me off. So, I'm just gonna ignore any other \"advice\" you have for me. So, just leave me alone, let me pack, worry about my own things, and keep your mouth shut.  She got pissed off and went to sit outside for a while. It was nice and quiet when she did this.  My mom thinks I went overboard and \"I know how she is\", so I should have just let her say whatever she wanted because, after all, she was just trying to help.  So, am I the asshole?  TLDR: I didn't want pushy sister's advice and told her so. She didn't like it.\n",
      "obligatory first time poster/on mobile apology.  My current boyfriend (18m) and I (16f) dated back in May of last year for a few months, until I ended things in August.   While we were broken up he had a flirty kind of relationship with another girl. We just got back together a few weeks ago, and she's coming over to his house tonight while his parents are out. I had to drag it out of him that it was her he's hanging out with, which is making me kind of suspicious. Not to mention she's having problems with her boyfriend right now.  AITA for being kind of pissed that he invited her over?\n",
      "For example, they may have plans to go on the boat or something and I just tell them I don't really feel like doing that, but don't let that stop you.   Whenever I object everybody gets upset and cancels their plans. I am not going out of my way making demands to accommodate me or anything, I just want to chill out and do nothing.   Am I the asshole?\n",
      "Me (f19) and my boyfriend (M23) were getting ready for a Christmas party earlier. I wanted to do some fun holiday makeup for the party that took me an hour total, in the end I felt really cute. I always like a second opinion so I asked my boyfriend what he thought about my makeup when I was finished. He looked at me and told me bluntly “honestly It looks really bad.”. Not what I was expecting but I did ask for an honest opinion, so I just told him “ok good to know” and went back to the bathroom to think of something else to do with my makeup. He stops me on my way and tells me “To be completely honest you look like a huge clown right now.” And he started laughing. I was kinda shocked to be honest and told him “alright I get it thanks”. Then yet again he makes another comment saying “yeah looks kind of stupid to be honest.”. At this point it was safe to say I had enough and got kind of pissed at him. His defense was I asked for his opinion, but I told him he could of given his opinion without calling me a clown and stupid. He says I’m overreacting. So what do you think, AITA?\n",
      "Context: My high school had a concert on the last day of school before Winter Break started. I had two friends that said they would join me. It is also worth noting that there were a couple of alternative locations you could sit within the school if you didn’t want to go to the concert. One of my friends, let's call him \"Ryan\" said “well, it’s either that or sitting in the library so I’ll probably be there.” He confirmed during lunch on the last day that I would see him at the concert when I asked.  &#x200B;  Issue:  Flash forward to end of day, I meet up with Ryan when the intercom alerts us that there’s a lockdown. It is not clear why the lockdown alarm went off, but it was not planned. I see Ryan going into the gym and I am trying to decide whether I should follow but I decide it’s too late and just go into the room right next to me. Soon, I hear a sound over the intercom. I do not hear what it says because I have a mild hearing loss but I assume it’s calling off the lockdown because I see people leaving the room I’m in. I head towards the auditorium and as I pass the gym I see him in the gym passing by a different set of doors. What I did not know at the time is that he was leaving through a nearby exit. I called him to ask him where he was and he didn't answer. I texted him a couple times clearly showing that I didn't like it. I won't show how I did that as that would break a rule, but he responded with \"Ohhh I dipped 😂\" \"I took that advantage\". I argued with him a bit more and I was going to do it a bit more but a friend was trying to get my attention so I just decided to block because I knew I would keep arguing if I had the chance  &#x200B;  It is worth noting that this block was always going to be temporarily and it was the first time I've blocked a friend, I just changed my mind from doing it from a couple days to just the afternoon to night after he said I should try not to be upset about it for too long.  &#x200B;  Ryan's point of view (night):  Ryan explained to me that I had things wrong and that he used the laughing emoji because he thought I was joking and that the emoji that I used has been used in a funny context before. He said that he \"didn't leave to abandon me and that I left because when the lockdown drill happened, I knew that if I left school, I wouldn't get in trouble. I wanted to start my winter break early 😅\". After some more back and forth, he said \"-, I didn't mean to hurt you and your emotions in such a moment of chaos. I understand your point of view at the moment, but I hope you can understand mine as well. Hearing the announcement for the lockdown, I tried to minimize the risk for myself and ultimately panicked.\"  &#x200B;  When I asked Ryan why he sent the previous stuff if he was panicked, he said he didn't want to admit it. I'm unsure what to think about that because I understood his point of view was something else but now his point of view is something else.\n",
      "I live in a neighborhood of mostly owner-occupied houses. One exception being the rental house directly behind mine. Our backyards are separated by a chain link fence. It's been a rental for at least the last five years and every year it has new tenants. The current tenant is BY FAR the trashiest (I'll call him \"T\").   My biggest issue is with T's dogs. T has 3 dogs (2 Pitts, a jack Russell) and a cat. It's a small house and I find it hard to believe that his landlord allows 4 animals but whatever. I love dogs (have one myself) but T is a shitty pet owner. I've actually witnessed him encouraging the male Pitt to be aggressive. They have a rope hanging from a tree that T encourages the dog to attack. The more rough the dog is, the more \"good boys\" he gets. One of my other neighbors was woken up at 10pm because one of T's friends started screaming claiming that the dog bit him. I guess the screaming went on for so long that my neighbor almost called the cops (I wasn't home that night so this is second hand info but I believe her).  Anyway, the dogs just stare and bark at my husband and I anytime we are outside. At first I thought they would just need to get use to us but it's been six months and they still just bark. T usually brings them in (after yelling at them to shut up over and over) so it doesn't generally last long but it's so annoying. We've dealt with several other tenants having dogs and this is never an issue but T is clearly a shit owner.   One fear I have about complaining is that T will take it out on his pets. He's always yelling at them as it is. So, what do you guys think? Will I be an Asshole for calling his landlord to complain?\n",
      "Tonight, at around 7:00 I went to go for a swim at the country club pool to clear my head due to some personal problems. Everything was going fine until this family showed up and the 2 parents let their kids go unsupervised. They start yelling at the top of their lungs, swimming through my lane, doing cannon balls next to my lane, and messing with the off duty lifeguard’s equipment. I had enough of the pandemonium and angrily told the kid to stop and show some common courtesy and to be quiet. As I swam away I failed to suppress an angry “holy shit” and the kid heard it. I felt so bad about that. He climbed out of the pool and told his dad, to which his dad says : “it’s a free country” and “how dare you cuss near my kid”. I’m 14 so it’s not like I was a grown ass man yelling at some random kids. Anyway, I feel like a total Karen and am looking for some answers :/\n",
      "I (26) have a brother (30) who has 3 kids. My brother first had my oldest nephew in high school and while disappointed, my family rallied behind him so much to help him and his girlfriend at the time. My nephew ended up living with my parents and I for almost 5 years, during which my brother managed to get fired from his job and divorced the child’s mom due to getting his coworker pregnant. Along came my niece, which none of us were thrilled about but were trying to make the best out of the situation. I expressed frustration during this pregnancy with the fact that he was having yet another child that he couldn’t afford or take care of properly so it would then become my parents stress. Nonetheless l, she was here and so I wasn’t willing to give up a relationship with her or my nephew who I’m v close to just to keep arguing about what was already done. However, he’s constantly having to crash at my parent’s house due to his water/electricity being turned off since he can’t afford some months because he doesn’t work. Then came my youngest nephew. Whenever he’s not crashing at my parent’s he’s taking money from them “for the kids” yet posts pictures of him out partying every weekend. My parents always complain to me about having to pitch in because he doesn’t make better choices. Fast forward to last night when my bf and I go to my grandma’s house for a family dinner where he announces that he got her pregnant AGAIN. Everyone just kind of stared but my mom said congratulations and tried to play it off. I was furious. I told him that he’s irresponsible, selfish and I don’t know where he keeps finding these girls dumb enough to get knocked up by him. I told them both that if they really cared about their children, they wouldn’t do this. I also told my parents that their constant bailing him out of these situations is enabling him to be a shitty father and get away with it. I told them I don’t want to a part of a family that supports bringing kids into the world just for them to have a struggling life and if they continue to bail him out financially that I won’t come around anymore. I’m tired of hearing them all complain about their lives with all of these kids but no one is doing anything to stop it. My brother and his fiancé say I’m an AH for commenting on their lives that have nothing to do with me (I disagree because they ask for money from me and my parent’s finances have to do with me). My dad is saying I’m TA for giving them an ultimatum and asking me to choose between having me in their lives or their grandkids starving.   I’m pretty sure I won’t be in the family anymore either way, but I’ve been torn on if I was too harsh. My grandma said she agrees with me but thinks i overreacted and should just let my parents suffer with my brother since that’s what they choose to do.\n",
      "So my Husband's Grandmother died 3 years ago, and left a piece of property to my FIL. We live in Mexico so inheriting a piece of property is different then in the US, in Mexico you still have to pay for the name change on the title ect (you're basically buying your own property back). Before I get into it let me describe the property, it's less the half an acre, there's no house built on the property, and the property hasn't been cleaned or maintained in years. So a few months after the funeral my Husband's Dad came to us asking if we could help him financially to get the papers in order. We said yes, but the thing was he wasn't going to pay us back, he said that my husband would then inherit the house from him. He even told us we should maintain and even build a house on the property because after all it was going to be ours, My Husband was excited and truth be told so was I. We helped him out with all the expenses, cleaned the land and were already making plans to build the house. But a few weeks ago my FIL called my husband asking him if he wanted the property and my husband said yes, and he told us he wanted 200thousand pesos for it. We were a little puzzled being that the original deal was we were going to help him out with all the finances and my husband would then inherit the house. My Husband said ok, it seemed fair for his dad to make a profit and the house would stay in the family. But when my I asked him why he changed his mind from the original deal. His dad flat out told us that the money was going to be used to buy a different piece of property that they were going to gift to my Husband's younger brother. I then told my husband I didn't want him to buy the property because it wasn't right for them to try to make a profit off my husband to spoil his little brother. We ended up having an argument over this, He says that it shouldn't matter to me what they do with the money, and I tell him I find it to be a slap in the face that we helped them out, and now they want to get more money out of him so they can benefit his brother. AITA?\n",
      "Based off the titled i am fully aware i am probably TA, but lets get into it. This happened 3 years ago so it isnt a pressing situation.  My roommate/bestfriend and were preparing dinner for my other roomates. I had just broken up with my ex bf, but we were trying to be friends and he asked if could come over to hang out.  He comes over and its going fine. We are talking about our internships through our school, and my ex is complaining about his. He is a nursing major, but his intership at the time wasnt standard nursing. He was working in what i can best describe as an assisted living facility for those who are severely mentally disabled.   He hated it a lot. He hated the responisbilities, he didnt feelike he was getting nursing experince that he wanted, and he didnt like the patients he had to care for. One of the things he said was \"i hate going into a male patients rooms, most of them just sit on their bed touching themselves\"  To which i replied \"Ya know, same\". my roommate laughed. But my ex was very offended. He called me an asshole and i immediately apologized for the joke.   Ex left shortly after that, and my roommate told me i wasnt an asshole for the joke. We talked about it with some other people (who i hope were truthful) and agreed i wasnt in the wrong.  Thinking back i thought i might be out of line. Was I the asshole for making that joke?\n",
      "A bit of back story before diving headfirst into this post. A friend of mine; we'll call (Toxic Girl-TG) and Myself; we'll call (Me-M) Decided that after a while of knowing each other 2 or so years decided to start dating (Or say that we were I don't know anymore) that's not the problem, The problem occurs the following week. When all of a sudden she's with someone else; we'll call (White Knight-WK). I didn't even know about WK until she was all goo-goo eyes with him, and so I being the fool I was decided 'If you're happy with him then I'll let him have you.'.   &#x200B;  Now cue the whole week after  M: Hey it got awkward between us didn't it?  TG: Yea...  M: It doesn't have to be that way we can still be friends but, I feel like you're pushing me away and if this continues I'm going to have to stop being your friend.  &#x200B;  the following day  TG: Hey WK and I are official stop trying to put a wedge between us.  M: I'm not I'm accepting of you to being together. I just want to remain friends.  &#x200B;  A few days after  WK: Hey I need to talk to you about TG.  M: Okay???  Wk: TG and I Are together stop trying to hit on her (Or something along those lines)  M: I'm not I just want to remain friends with her she needs to understand that.  WK: No YOU need to understand. And you need to stop being manipulative.  M: I'm not...  WK: Threatening to cut ties with her that's being manipulative.  M: I'm not. I'm trying to still be friends with her.  WK: A friend doesn't threaten to cut ties.  M: A friend who is being pushed away does.  TG (Or at least I think it is): No, a manipulative person does.  WK: Says something retarded B.S. about staying her friend or not.  M: I won't then, simple as that.  &#x200B;  Too long/Didn't read.  A friend and I started dating then behind my back she is with someone else, I try to remain friends but it was made hard to, so I told them to cut it out or I will stop being friends with them, then I am lied about and to and about to her friends then I stop being friends with them.  So Reddit am I the A**hole for cutting ties with her?\n",
      "So I just got a new job in a different city and I’m about to leave for who knows how long. I told my friend and he insisted we go to lunch. We had already been tried to go to lunch twice this month but he would also fall through and it wouldn’t happen. So today he said he could go but he forgot had to do an audit at his job and it would be later than normal lunch time. He suggested Saturday and I agreed but then he insisted we go today.   Cut to now and he just canceled today, then wanted to change it to beers and tonight. I told him I couldn’t because I’m on a pretty strict diet right now and more importantly he’s canceled so much that I just don’t trust him keeping these plans. Needless to say he blew up and wants to make me feel guilty for not wanting to go later. He also called me like 6 times in the  last hour to which I didn’t answer cause I’ve made myself clear.   Now am I the Asshole for putting my foot down? I know this sounds like a shit post but I do feel bad for not doing it but at this point I’m fed up.\n",
      "About a year ago my mom [72F] announced she had met someone on words with friends from another country and was going to go meet them. A month later she comes back, says she’s going back for three months, and she wants to divorce my dad because this friend is actually her “cyber boyfriend” that she’s been cheating on my dad with since August 2018 (so only ~2 prior). Fine, my parents should have probably gotten a divorce years ago so the divorce isn’t my issue. My issue is the guy that she just met on words with friends and knows basically nothing about (she’d argue otherwise since she had a “PI” check him out). She has been there pretty much since this time last year other than a few days she needed to come to the States due to her visa conditions. Of course she’s my mom and I naturally love her. We used to be close and despite how cheesy it is, she was my best friend. Losing her like this has been extremely difficult so I still try and see her when she comes to the States.  I get a call this morning that she’s driving through my town with her boyfriend and wants me to meet him and get lunch. Prior to this I really didn’t want anything to do with him just because that’s all she would talk about when she’d visit. She wouldn’t ask me how I was or how my studies were going. I reluctantly agree and decide to give this guy a chance at least because I really wanted to see my mom. I haven’t seen her in months.  They pick me up for lunch. He doesn’t say hi, he doesn’t introduce himself. Every time I try to talk to him he ignores me. I let it go. I can be shy too. Finally as we were getting ready to leave, she says she still wants to go to my graduation in May and would like BF to come too but it’s up to me if I want him there. I’d tell her I’d think about it, and honestly I was still giving this guy a chance so maybe I’d want him there.   After shopping she drove me home and on the way I mentioned that I wouldn’t really be comfortable with him at my graduation. He didn’t really want anything to do with me and I don’t really want to feel like that on my “special day”. The day I get my MS is going to be the most important day of my life so far as a first generation student. She gets mad and says she’s no longer interested in coming since she only will go if BF can go despite her saying it was my choice if he came or not. She said it wouldn’t be fair for him to sit in the hotel while we celebrated. I asked if he could just stay in his country with his family since there was no reason for him to come all the way here for something he wouldn’t be partaking in. She then gets more infuriated and tells me it’s typical selfish behavior that I wouldn’t want her to be happy and want him to be there and that I need to learn to accept her new life.   AITA for not wanting my moms cyber boyfriend at my graduation?   TLDR: mom blows up and calls me selfish because I don’t want her cyber boyfriend (that she cheated on my dad with) to come to my MS graduation.\n",
      "I was until recently in a relationship with a woman who has slight manipulative tendencies. She often says thing to get attention out of me. Small things mostly. (Eg. Going to go sit on a bench in the street in the middle of the night if I'm not able to sleep at hers)  A few weeks ago she told me that she had made an agreement via texts with one of my best friends that if she lacks affection she would go to him. This kind of irked me but I didn't really make an issue out of it. Then the weeks that followed she's hanging out with him 4-5 times a week. At this point I didn't feel comfortable anymore with it.  So I speak to both of them about this arrangement they made. Turns out they never discussed it as such and it was mostly poor phrasing on her end towards mme. She claims involuntarily (and quite possibly ccomments I made up all together) but to me it feels as if she was trying to make me jealous.  We had a fight over this tendency to say duplicitous things.   Now today she tells me she's going to move in with this friend of ours.  I get that I might be alarmistic, but I frankly don't feel comfortable with her moving in with him, and the probable 'misunderstandings' that will ensue.  So WIBTA for wanting to throw in the towel already?\n",
      "For my senior prom, I bought a gorgeous teal ball gown (on sale for 1/3 of it’s original price) and, between my mom and I, “jeweled” it up, added lace, the works! The total cost I spent on the dress and it’s alterations almost met the dress’s original price. I love that dress and the memories of picking out jewels and other items with my mom and working on it together.  Since my senior prom, I have only ever worn the dress two more times for major events. With 2020 prom season around the corner, more and more dresses are popping up at department stores and some of the ones I’ve seen are really pretty.  A few days ago, my aunt called me and asked if my cousin could borrow the dress for prom in late April and I said “no, I‘m sorry.” This didn’t fly with my aunt who immediately said I graduated high school over half a decade ago (edit: almost 7 years ago) and  have  to let her borrow it. I explained to her the sentimental value of the dress then pointed out that my cousin is almost a foot shorter than me and roughly four sizes smaller and thus alterations would need to be made.  If alterations of any sort are made to fit my cousin, it’s no longer borrowing imo. At that point, I might as well give it to her. I want to be able to wear it again if another big event happens and the possibility to take a dress out when taken in is zero because of our size difference.  Anyway, this leads her to calling my mom to have her convince me to let my cousin borrow the dress which my mom also said ’no’ because my uncle makes good money and they should be able to get my cousin a really nice, unique dress if she so desires.  Then my aunt offered to buy it for under a $80 and my mom laughed before hanging up on her. Now there’s divide among other family members and after some of them made passive aggressive FB posts or straight up ~call out~ posts, I blocked most of them. My high school prom dress isn’t even in the state I currently live in and is in a climate controlled storage unit owned by my dad and step mom.  Before anyone asks, my cousin is not involved - by her choice, I’m not sure. She won’t respond to any msgs I send her on the few social medias we both have and any comments I make on a new post are deleted. AITA?  EDIT: To the people asking, I wore the dress to two (2) military balls I was invited to. I didn’t feel the need to buy new dresses when I have one that fits both occasions. Since I’m new to Reddit, I didn’t realize I couldn’t edit to add a quick pic of the dress. I made a quick gdoc with a pic. I’m sorry it’s not the best pic. All my other pics are in storage until further notice. ALSO; the dress was NOT advertised as a prom dress. I only went looking for a ball gown because that’s the style dress I wanted to wear. Yes, there are other occasions to wear a teal ball gown. Also, I fixed the date of my prom and didn’t provide additional info about my prom because I don’t think it’s relevant.   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RtT81Kmd49WbT-YLJTiDfEKj3CzHLkgYaWJIzSA3IrU\n",
      "I didn't know how to summarize this in the title really.  My (32M) girlfriend (30F) is a  big  Fortnite lover, she played it almost daily for the last 2 years. I wasn't a big fan because it seemed slow and too colorful for my taste. She did try to get me to play it with her a few times, I didn't have much fun the times we tried honestly.  But then one day I realized that I'd very much like to spend more time with her (because I do adore her) and so what if it's playing a \" juvenile \" game?  I secretly installed it and one day suprised her by sending her an invite while she was already gaming, she accepted and was ecstatic to play together.  And it  really  was fun (for both of us) the first month we played together. I was a newbie and had no idea about anything, she taught me everything about it. After a while I started getting good at it, real good. Myb better than her.   She started saying stuff like \"I shouldn't have more kills than her since this is   her   game, not mine\". I thought she was joking, but appearantly not. She became real quiet whenever we'd play and would get mad when I'd have a high kill game, even winning wouldn't be fun for her if I had a lot more eliminations than her.  I said to her that it shouldn't matter who has more eliminations in the game, it's the time we spend together that's most important, and that it hurts me and makes me anxious when she says that she only has fun when she has more eliminations than me.   I said that's not ok, and I might've said that she's acting immature.  I could be in the wrong here, I don't know. Am I the asshole?\n",
      "Throwaway because she uses this sub.  My (20M) roommate (20F) thinks I have a drinking problem. UK, legal age and all that. I work nights, in quite a demanding and stressful job, and sometimes (realistically maybe once a month? Every six weeks maybe?) when I get home in the morning I'll have a couple of drinks to relax and unwind. I honestly do not drink very often because I don't really like the feeling of being drunk, but a slight buzz is fine.  Now, without fail, for the last year every time I have been having one of these mornings my roommate has walked in. At first she didn't say anything, but the last three times she has. The first couple times she said \"are you sure you should be drinking at this time?\" and stuff about it being so early. I brushed it off, this is my evening. This morning I said something back because she accused me of having a drinking problem because I was drinking at 8am, I told her that I have been awake and working all night and her 8am is my 8pm so it's perfectly acceptable and I was tired of feeling judged for something so innocuous that I do once a month. I didn't raise my voice or insult her, I was firm. This is my home too and this is reasonable. She called me an asshole and shut herself in her room. I feel that I haven't done anything wrong, AITA?\n",
      "Using a throwaway because a couple friends follow my main.  So awhile back I started to like this girl. A friend of mine liked her at the same time. I knew that he liked her, he might’ve known that I liked her. We never really talked about it. My friend ended up dating her for a little while. She was his first real girlfriend and they dated for about two months or so. It was in tenth grade so it didn’t get super serious or anything, but it got serious to him.  When they broke up he was really torn up for a while. I never really talked to him much about it because he never opened up to me too much, but everyone could see how upset he was. I stopped talking to the girl for a few months. The two of us weren’t super close and I figured I needed to stand by my friend.  After a little while passed I started to talk to her again. Feelings started to re emerge. As some more time passed we actually became pretty good friends and it became clear we both had feelings for her. I didn’t make a move though because even though it was almost half a year later he was clearly still hung up on her.  About a years passed since there relationship happened. My friend started to get upset with me a lot. He had a tendency to get pretty mad at people, and around this time it was especially me. He caught on that I like the girl, but rather than talking it out he started to get mad at me constantly. To be fair though, I didn’t talk to him either.  After a little while of this, this girl tells me that she likes me. I tell her I like her too, but I say before we do anything I have to talk to my friend. I talk to my friend and ask if it’s ok to ask her out. He says it is so I ask her out.   We start dating and it’s all ok for a little bit, but then my friend starts getting extremely mad at me constantly. He explodes and then all together stops talking to me.   Ultimately the relationship ends, and my friend still won’t talk to me. According to the rest of my friends, he wants to be friends again and has forgiven me. But I don’t want to be friends with a person that stopped talking to me after he said it would be ok to date this girl. My friends have told me to be the bigger person and apologize. So am I the asshole here for not wanting to be friends again and for ignoring him from here on out?\n",
      "So recently I've gotten into an argument with this kid who made fun of people and their parents in a group chat. Then one day his mom gets into a car accident I realized the irony and pointed it out. He of course wasn't happy with this and guess what made fun of my parents. So after that when I was having a civil conversation on this group chat he said no one cares I responded \"No one cares about your mom\". After that he threw a tantrum and started throwing insults so we removed him but he is still an ass hole at school. Edit: Let me point out that his mom got out unscaved and the parents who he made fun of were either dead or not around\n",
      "Today, my dad brought up banking things that need to be sorted out since I became of legal age. However, he accuses me of being lazy about getting them done even though said banking things haven't been mentioned since my birthday nor has there been any urgency to complete them. He can't even remember what specific things need to be done. When ever I argued back to him that the laziness he accused me of wasn't true he doubled down of his claims saying I made excuses about school etc. Even though, as mentioned, the task was never brought up so I wouldn't have had the chance to make an excuse. Afterward, he says he was just teasing me but still wants me to apologize for fighting with him. Was I wrong to fight with him?\n",
      "So I'm 21 and my father is nearing 63 and one day my father asks me to go and buy him cigarettes while im out running other errands.   For a bit of backstory my father started smoking when he was 19 and has quit several times now. The last time he quit I promised him that I would never see the day he smokes again and that I would do everything in my power to \"help\" him quit. He wasnt smoking up until the past few months and i noticed it when i came home from college one weekend. He told me that it was temporary and that he was going to quit soon. We went on a vacation to Las Vegas in March as a late 21st b-day gift and he was still smoking then, his exuse then was that oh just while im in vegas yada yada and the same story when incam back home in mid april right before i came home for the summer. I told him then that once I get home for the summer im not gonna put up with it and im gonna start cracking down on it once im home for the summer.   Summer rolls around and hes still smoking the same amt. per day. He is my only family left on my his side of the family, my mother passed when i was 12, and not close family lives near me. I cant be the one responsible for sending him closer to his grave, the thought of him passing makes me sick as it would most. I told him im not gonna buy him the pack of cigarettes and he \"erupts\" and starts scolding me about how i need to lusten to what im told and that im under his roof, and I would normally agree but this is different no? Hes a bit stricker than most but i turned out better for it and i love him too much to watch him slowly pass with cigarettes, let alone enable it.   Am I the asshole?\n",
      "I was recently diagnosed by my PCP with shoulder impingement, and received a prescription for PT. I selected a clinic and had an initial assessment.  I was displeased.  The assigned PT said several things that concerned me.  First, she mentioned several times that she had just taken a class on brain/stress/pain connection, and that she was looking forward to putting things she learned into my therapy. While I believe there quite likely is a connection, I have a physical condition that needs specific therapy, and I'm not terribly willing to be a test case for her new learning.  Further, in discussing my medical forms she honed in on my mental health. I did not answer the questions on the form; instead I wrote that I am being treated for panic disorder and anxiety. I told her I am being treated with medication and therapy, and have been for over twenty years.  She mentioned she wanted to hear what my psychiatrist/therapist and I discussed as psychs just give out pills instead of working more holistically.  I informed her that before I was medicated I was completely agoraphobic and that medication had changed my life, and that I have no intention of discussing any of this as her questions were quite an overreach, this is none of her business, and has no bearing on my physical condition.  She then told me that there is nothing wrong with me orthopedically (with no testing or evidence for her diagnosis), while massaging my arms and telling me my pain should be getting better, to which I responded it's better when you stop. The entire experience was off putting.  I very much sensed that she viewed herself as my personal savior from depression ( I lost my mom a month ago, which I had told her) and that she believed my pain was a result of stress.  I just want medical treatment from a PT, not lectures on the brain under stress and discussion of my depression. Am I the asshole for wanting to switch to a different PT?\n",
      "My mom wants me to remove my password so she can access my phone anytime she wants. I  16 female. on the other hand don't want to.  It's not that I'm hiding something from her, Its just that I want my privacy as well. The phone was bougth two months ago and I opened my savings for it, however It wasn't enough so she added 200 to buy the phone to help me with my studies.  I downloaded tons of apps including games such as COD and I would play it occasionally whenever I got free time. However she's been on my tail since yesterday saying that I should delete my games and remove my password and simply use my phone for calls.  I'm a college student and lately I've been stressed since once I'm off school, I have to take care of my siblings, do chores, and study. I barely have time for myself since I get home late.  I admit that sometimes I play too much but it doesn't affect my performance in my studies. I still participate in the class and have my projects done on time.   She wants me remove everything by tomorrow and I don't plan to remove anything, I've hidden my games and that's just about it. I've been doing everything she asks of me, even though I struggle. But this time I just dont want to. I'm tired.   So Am I the Asshole?\n",
      "I (21F) moved out of my parents house and into a duplex with a friend from school (also 21F) in March 2021. We signed a 12 month lease and talked about extending it a couple of months so we would move out when the school year ended.   At the time I had a job that gave steady hours. After a few months of living there I realized that my checks were breaking even with my bills and expenses but that didn’t bother me. Then the company I was working for went out of business so I was stuck trying to find a job that would give me the hours I needed. I got a job but not one that paid the same or gave the same hours. I was making less money and I would have to over work myself just to pay bills.   So I decided to move out and back home with my parents. I agreed to pay my rent but not the utilities since I won’t be using them. I kept my key because the landlord came to me for anything with the duplex. I said before I moved Back home that I would give up my key if we found someone to take over my rent. After moving back home I decided I did not want to extend the lease because I wasn’t even living there anymore.   When I went back to get my baking supplies that I’d forgotten my (ex) roommate asked if I could leave my keys and I said no. That my name was still on the lease and explained about the landlord. They then told me I had no reason to need a key if none of my furniture was there (most of the furniture in the living room and kitchen was actually mine) and that they were paranoid about me having a key and posible coming there in the middle of the night? (I never even went into their room unless they were in it). I said that’s not true (about the furniture) and then I was accused of throwing the furniture situation in their face. I apologized and then told them I was keeping the key unless someone took my rent. I also told them if I needed to stop by the place for any reason that I would text them to let them know I’d be there. The way they’ve been acting, my parents told me I should keep my key in case someone tries to live there without me knowing.   I then let them know I was not extending the lease and that it doesn’t make sense for me to extend a lease I’m not living in and that hopefully we will find someone I can sublease to and we won’t have to even worry about it. They then told me to leave and cut off the conversation. I was giving them over 6 months notice so if they needed to save up. I haven’t talked to them since but am I the asshole for not wanting to extend the lease and keep the key?\n",
      "Some backstory: growing up my parents loved to brag about how I was a live in baby sitter for my younger siblings. I wasn’t allowed to go out on the weekends or do after school activities because I needed to be on call for any potential babysitting needs. I was even forced to stay home from HS if their elementary school had a snow day and miss lessons and exams to babysit. This got to be really stressful as a teen, but if I ever protested I was told it was my obligation as the oldest. I never questioned it (I’m very introverted).   Fast forward to now: I’m in my late 20s, married, live in my own house and have my own family. My parents call me to TELL me they need me to come over and babysit. Not ask, Demand. They tell me I need to be there at such and such time. My car is currently at the shop so I’m relying on my husband bringing me everywhere. And I have an infant of my own. I tell them I can’t because he’s working and won’t be home until midnight. They start getting MAD at me, telling me that they did everything for me and the least I can do is help them out for once in my life. I’m LIVID, and start snapping back that I’m done being their slave and I’m tired of being treated like another parent to my siblings.   It’s been a few days and I’ve calmed down, now I feel like garbage as they have been ignoring me. I feel like I should admit that I was wrong and apologizing for not helping them out when they needed it because after all they are my family. But I also don’t want to back down and go back to being treated like a rug... I just need some opinions on whether IWTA or not.,, thanks in advance\n",
      "I am a male and the situation is pretty simple.   I went to a bathroom in a gas station with my step dad. He goes to the urinal and I didn’t wanna pee next to him so I went to a stall and peed there without closing the stall door.   A guy walks in who needed to poop and waited for me to get out of there and, as per guy code nobody said a word the whole time.   We get out of there and my step dad scolds me for leaving the door open and how I was rude to that guy for doing that.   I don’t think I was in the wrong because stalls are basically the same as urinals so I don’t think I should’ve closed the door even though that’s the norm.\n",
      "I had a friend over today (quarantine is loosening a little where I'm from), and he's recently started transitioning, and using he/them pronouns and changed his name to (we'll say Jake? for privacy). He and I haven't seen each other for a while, so we spent the whole day talking and watching ghibli movies, and making cinnamon buns.  My dad was home most of the day, and constantly used she/her pronouns when talking to Jake, and used his old name (They'd met before). I corrected my dad, but he didn't really listen, and went to play video games.  Eventually, Jake leaves, we high five (less germs can spread than from a hug, but i would love a fucking hug man), and 10 minutes later, he texts asking me to tell my parents what his new name/pronouns are. I tell him of course, and head to the living room to talk to both my parents (they both misgendered him, but my mom is less important than my dad in this story). Conversation goes like this:  Me: \"Hey guys, i forgot to tell you, but my friend has started transitioning and now uses He/them pronouns, and goes by Jake, so could you use those next time?\"  Mom: \"Ok, no problem\"  Dad: \"Well ok but I didn't use she/her pronouns for your friend.\"  Me: \"Yea you did\"  Dad: \"What are you talking about? No I didn't. Listen, if you wanna get all angry about this, that's not my problem ok?\"  Conversation goes on like this, with my dad denying having misgendered Jake, and making my request all about him and how I hate him. I leave to eat supper, and he comes to see me 30 minutes later to say: \"I'm sorry, I know you're angry because you care about your friend, you can tell me about your problems ok?\" Which... has nothing to do with the issue at hand, right? I mean I just asked him to not misgender my friend... maybe I'm missing something. AITA?  EDIT 1: I didn't explain to them beforehand that Jake was transitioning, and explained to them that i should've. Forgot to add that part. I did also correct my dad while he was misgendering Jake though.  EDIT 2: My dad isn't incredibly knowledgable about gender Identity, and I had a discussion with him last week trying to educate him about the subject. He seemed defensive then too, and said there were too many gender identities to keep track of.\n",
      "Throwaway account. I (27F) am about 16 weeks pregnant and have been having a really rough pregnancy. High risk, lots of complications, many Dr trips and a few ER visits, and other major health issues separate from this. My fiance (30M) has been dealing with all of this well until tonight.  Last night we had a wonderful day, we were all lovey-dovey, etc. Today, we started fine and then this afternoon he had asked to watch a movie we've both already seen that I didn't care for. I turned him down and asked if there were any others he'd like to watch. He just kinda said no, seemed upset, then left the room. I tried to ask if it hurt him, apologize, etc. He said nothing, really. Well then I go lay down for a bit because my back has been hurting since we had both been doing a lot of chores today and again, pregnant. I knew he had been in the kitchen working, and had some stuff on the counter. I asked him if I could move it to cook, and he said it was fine. I will say, I am wearing adult diapers at this point because of my previous C-section causing a lot of scar tissue that is now pulling on my bladder and causing me to become more incontinent. I'm really stressed about it and it hurts, like a UTI. Of course, I can't do a lot about it and being pregnant is making it much worse. I was already halfway crying because of it (emotional and painful cry) as I was trying to finish dinner. He got upset with me for putting the stuff in a place that I didn't realize was dirty (it was the silverware and rack, I put it back in the drawer), and I even said I would clean it up. I tried to ask him what was wrong, and he didn't say anything. I honestly don't remember how the rest went because I was crying so hard by this point and exploded about how I'm already in pain and don't want to ruin his dinner so I excused myself and went to our room to cry. I ended up feeling like I had to pee, so I ran to the bathroom and was crying. I heard him come up, go back down, then the car started... He drove off... literally didn't say anything and left.  Reddit, what can I do to fix this? AITA?   PS - can't take the 3 approved antidepressants while pregnant because none of them work or make me way sicker. So meds are not an option.\n",
      "My sister treats me like shit so im in my room 99% of the time and when I do spend time in the rest of the apartment I clean up after myself.

      "That title sounds bad. So let me elaborate.   I am dating a kind man. And we make a good team for a reason. Where is more quiet, soft spoken and (for lack of better words) docile... I am more bold and outgoing.   I'm normally rather polite. But if you piss me off or if you are in general an ass (to my loved ones) expect to get my bad side.   My partner entered a 3 year program last year. This is a very challenging program and he's in a delivery of it that goes pretty much all year long with minimal breaks. He's currently in year 2, summer semester, and he is struggling.   He's one of the smartest people I know. In the first two semesters, it's an online delivery and he does  really well . Mid to high 90's. But when he's on campus and doing the hands on courses - which I do acknowledge are the harder ones - he gets really bad grades.   In year one, we discuss why he believed this was. And his honest answer he felt set up to fail. I encouraged him to either seek accommodations or speak to someone. But as he is a male in a primarily female dominated course (and industry) he of course had his own reasons for choosing not to (fear of retaliation or fear of not being believed or scrutinized for being a male complaining about female teachers).   His schooling isn't cheap either. I want to put that out there. Each year costs overall around $7,000.   Some  important  things of note (just from the last week): • There have been 2-3 quizzes worth a good mark in his classes that him, and everyone he has spoken to about it, pretty much failed. • Alarmingly, he told me about a discrepancy between the (professor required and written) textbooks and the professors lessons that could potentially be fatal to patients (not human) • In class today, they did not have something critical to the lesson (something part of his school funds pay for), and when he mentioned it, he got shrugged off. • Teachers often issue tests and quizzes - advising students what to study - and test them on material not even covered yet. • Teachers do not respond to questions or requests in a timely manner. • Yesterday he got a terrible grade on a quiz worth 10% of his mark. It was 35 questions, some were short answer, only 15 minutes to write it.   I want him to succeed but his teachers are very much - in my honest opinion - coming off as incompetent.   He text me earlier in a sheer panic. He wants to drop the course at this point because he feels targeted some days (he's one of  two  males in the whole course of his expected to graduate class), he feels that he can't do anything right, he doesn't know how he's going to pass his classes... he spends almost all day every day when he's home studying or doing homework. He feels he can never catch a break or get ahead.   Being the (sometimes) abrasive person I am, I want to help. But my support alone right now won't do much to help. He's so distressed.   So I'm wondering. WIBTA if I decided to make a report with his school? Or their accreditation boards?\n",
      "I'll keep it short, I'm not the smartest individual, by far. But I can't help but feel bad when my SO tries to explain stuff to me, but I still don't understand, sometimes he raises his voice at me, and sometimes I raise my voice back defensively. For both sides, I understand it's my fault for not understanding, and how for him it must be very agitating. I can't help but to feel like he talks to me like a child most times. But that's what I understand I guess. I just don't feel like it's right for me to get angry at him or vise versa? I have not a clue who wound be in the wrong in this situation, and just wanted some unbiased opinions on this. For context I'm 19 and he is 23, I also did not finish highschool but he did, although im not an idiot in most cases :)  Edit: let me clarify, the problem arose because I don't understand government processes, like with department of social services. I grew up super poor and stuff so we never dealt with gov stuff, so I have no idea about \"adult stuff\" even though I'm an adult. I had noone there to teach me this stuff :(\n",
      "I (20f) am a study hall aide in a middle school (grades 7-8, so mostly 12-14 year olds). Basically I'm there to supervise them while they do their work. Sometimes I help with homework if asked.   I love my job, I think most of my kids are hilarious, and they do talk to me. There are a group of boys who talk to me sometimes (I try to keep them on task, but sometimes they don't have any work to do). They'll make jokes, ask me questions, nothing inappropriate. They have crossed a line a few times (shown me a meme that says a swear word, something like that) and I've always told them that they shouldn't be showing me these things. I've had some of the girls ask me for fashion and dating advice, and nothing they've asked or shown has been inappropriate so I usually give them the most 'teacher' answer, like \"you should tell administration about this\" over telling them to dump their friend. I try my best to be professional with them and I like to think that I'm not crossing any lines and if they see me as an older sister figure I really have no problem with that. It's not everyday that they approach me with something funny or a story or a question about video games or advice, but I like to make sure my classroom is a safe space and I'm a safe person.  My sister (27f) thinks differently. At easter I was talking about my job and how much I've grown to like the age group that I've changed my mind about teaching elementary, I now want to teach middle history/english. My sister has expressed that she thinks it's weird how friendly I am with my students. I explained that they were the ones who \"made friends\" with me and I don't ask them unwarranted personal questions. She still thinks it's weird that I'm close with my middle schoolers, and that they're too old to be my \"friends.\" I then explained that me and them are not friends, they don't contact me outside of school, and that they just trust me and I've built up a good teacher/student relationship with them. She then said that I'm not a teacher (which, no, not technically, sure.) and then thought it was gross that I wanted to \"hang out with preteens for a career.\" This broke my heart - I know at that age I had teachers who were kind and friendly to us and I absolutely adored them and I believe all ages deserve kindness, respect, and safety in school, and I don't see how me caring for preteens-early teens is different than someone wanting to teach younger kids. I feel weird and like I've done something wrong. AITA?\n",
      "Só, last year I was accused for screwing up a party on College that I didn't even participated. So, the group of friends I had, that also includes my girlfriend, started to ignore me, and when I confronted them, they said they would not talk to me because I was guilty until proven otherwise. I was shocked by this decision, and realised that if the people I trusted most did not believed me, the right thing to do was getting away from them. The only person that I still talk is, obviously, my girlfriend.  A month ago, my girlfriend said she still talks to them normally, like the situation never happened. I said to her that this hurts a lot, because they didn't even listened to my version of the facts. I also said that if the situation happened to her, I wouldn't even think otherwise and would have stood by her and got away from them. She said that she stands by me, but is not the kind of person that distances from people because of a relationship. AITA for trying to make her get away from those people?\n",
      "Almost every night for the last 3 months (10p-1230a), I hear a crying kid (about 7) crying from his upstairs window into the night. Just from what im able to piece together the kid just cries that his mother leaves for work at night, and flings open the window   every god damned night   to let the entire complex know for over an hour that he wants his damn mommy. So tomorrow afternoon I think I'm going to have to be the one to file a complaint over it.   &#x200B;  I have taken into account the idea that he might be severely mentally disabled, but I came to the conclusion that IDGAF, as I believe if you have a kid that is so severely mentally disabled he actively and goes out of his way to make everyone around themselves life worse, you should give them to a nursing home.\n",
      "I (28M) have three kids with my ex. We were together 7 years. She cheated after our first kid was born and I forgave her. She cheated again last year and I broke up with her. She got pregnant from that cheating and now has another kid. I am a good dad to our kids. We share custody, I support my kids financially and I will never leave my kids, but she keeps asking me to take on her other kid and wanting me to step in and be the dad he doesn't have. His father doesn't want to know apparently and because our kids still have me it's \"not fair\" and \"I could be a great dad for him\". It pisses me the fuck off because I had to pay for a DNA test to be 100% sure, I then had to deal with her family giving me shit for leaving her while she was pregnant. Now they all want me to be the \"better man\" and raise her kid with someone else and I've gotta ask, where does the shit end? What if she ends up with another kid from another deadbeat? Do I gotta keep raising her kids until she's done having them? I take care of MY kids. I love MY kids. But they are my responsibility, her other kid is not. I don't wanna be on the hook for picking up after her the rest of my life. I just wanna be a good dad to my kids, man.  I don't hate the kid. I know it's not his fault.

At the end of the year there was a performance where the parents and stuff would get to see it but I didn't want to go so I didn't show up. The show wasn't part of the grade and I didn't want to waste a day on something I didn't enjoy. My friend said I was being a jerk for doing that but I felt that they didn't really need me.\n",
      "A little backstory, I work 12 hour shifts and have a 2 month old son at home.  Yesterday during work, my wife was texting me how our son had been fussy all day and how she had been having difficulty getting him to nap.  She essentially spent the whole 12 hours I was gone holding or rocking him, which we both expect with a newborn, but it makes for a very long day.  &#x200B;  After I got home around 9ish yesterday I noticed the neighbors were having a party but it was relatively low key.  Me and the wife had dinner and got our son calmed down and finally asleep in his crib in our bedroom.  About 930 our neighbor's kids started setting off fireworks.  It's fine by me if people want to shoot off their fireworks early, but the problem I was having was that they were setting off the artillery shells and black cats directly in front of our house rather than in front of theirs, meaning we had fireworks going off about 20 feet from our window, which woke our baby up.  &#x200B;  I went out and told them that I would never ask them to not set off fireworks, but that I would appreciate it if they didn't set them off directly in front of our house, and asked if they could possibly move down the street a bit.  It would still be loud, but hopefully not loud enough to keep the baby awake.  The neighbor explained that due to the tree across the street from their house that reached over the street, they were worried about setting off anything that shot in the air.  He also mentioned the power lines on the other side of his house, and that they were planning on stopping at the 10pm cut off for fireworks in town.  &#x200B;  After I went back in, I didn't hear any more fireworks, so I think they decided to end it early.   I didn't mean for them to stop completely, I was just hoping that they would stop setting them off so close to my house.  I never thought I would be that neighbor, but here we are.  AITA?\n",

      "I (23m) and my friend (24f) are both avid chess players. We have played for a decade or more and love the sport. I am an intermediate player (for those in chess, I'm an elo of 1800) while my friend has become good enough to play competitively (elo 2300).  Her most recent competition was taking place online and because of shoddy internet connection at her house, she asked if she could use a room at my house for  the duration of the match (7 rounds over 2 days) to make sure her connection would not break (causing her to get disqualified). It turned out the she was doing very well over the course the tournament, making it all the way to the semi-finals. Because of this achievement I had come to spectate the round, hopefully learn a couple of things and also cheer her on.  As I watched I noticed something fishy, a lot of the moves were not ones that logical humans would do, but started to make sense later on in the game. As of then, she had lost the first game of the round and won the second game meaning she would need to win this final game to win the round and move onto the finals. During the break between game 2 and 3 I walked into to the room, just in time to see a chess engine there.  It is an established fact that chess engines are far superior to humans and its strictly prohibited to use an engine because they give you an overpowered advantage. At first I felt betrayed because I didn't know she would break the integrity of the game like that. She pleaded me to not to tell anyone (especially the organizers) because she was \"going up against stronger players\" and has never used an engine till this point. Additionally she said that she needed the prize money ($25k) to support her family (they aren't very well off).  I was split on what to do but ultimately my conscience couldn't let the other contestants be robbed of the money because of her cheating. She got caught disqualified and barred from competing ever again. Her account of also ~8years is also closed meaning she has lost all her progress. She is extremely mad at me and I have even gotten calls from her mother yelling at me about how \" I destroyed their family and want them to be poor.\" She won't discuss the matter with me.  Aita?\n",
      "I'm 24F and younger sister is 20F.My younger sister and I both see separate therapists weekly. This is due to trauma, grief, family issues. Our appointments are at the same time so that I can drive us both, as I'm the only one with a car at the moment.During the ride there she was berating me, being cruel, interrupting me if I tried to speak, screaming that she didn't care about what I was trying to tell her. She does this often, and not only with me but with my mom and our older sister as well. She is in general, very rude and ungrateful, and never says thank you to any of us for the many times we have to pay for her things/food/give her rides.   Once in the lobby of the therapists offices I said after sitting quietly and thinking for awhile, \"I'm not going to give you a ride home. You can take a cab or walk.\" She scoffed and said, \"yeah, ok.\" Clearly not believing me.  I discussed with my therapist the situation, we checked the weather and the distance, it would be a 40 min walk in a straight line back to our house, and it was not snowing, 40° F, and not too windy. She would be fine. I decided to stand my ground. My therapist said that if this sounded like me being impulsive and unreasonable she would have tried to convince me not to do it but she agreed with me this was an alright thing to do. When exiting therapy she was waiting for me and moved towards the door, I told her that I was not joking and she had to find her own way home. She still was laughing and not believing me. I unlocked my door to the car, got in, locked the car, and slowly backed up and drove away while she slammed her hands on the windows and yanked on the door screaming \"what the fuck?!\" And other expletives.   I cried on the way home feeling guilty but at the same time so tired of being treated like a doormat. I called my mom and explained everything through tears, she told me it was alright and to come spend the night at her house. I am currently at my mom's house. I called our older sister and explained as well, she said she is proud of me for standing up for myself and that younger sister cannot keep treating people the way she does and get away with it.   Younger sister got home and got on wifi, and instantly took to Facebook Messenger in our family chatroom. The first thing she did was tell me to \"Watch out for (my cat), because who knows what could happen.\" Then repeatedly tried to smear me to older sister and Mom who I think for the most part are on my side. Younger sister then said she is deleting all my Minecraft world's, which I accepted as something she has done in the past when she is mad at me. I only hope that when I get home she hasn't destroyed any of my artwork (paintings and drawings).   I feel sick to my stomach right now, I haven't msged her back and don't plan to tonight. Did I do the right thing?  UPDATE: I had tons of people asking for an update, so I was given approval to update on this post. I went back to the house today, my cat is fine and I've brought her to my mom's. My Minecraft worlds are gone. It doesn't look like she went in my room. I'm avoiding her and still staying at my mom's. I cannot stay here permanently for many reasons.  To address a few questions I kept getting: yes we live together along with older sister. We haven't even lived in this apartment a month, we cannot renew the lease this early. We cannot afford to leave, or kick her out. I cannot \"beat her up\" or anything and risk legal action against myself. If I find she has done damage to my property in the future I will not hesitate to take her to court. I do not have a lock on my door. I do not have money. Most of people's suggestions require money. I don't have $20.00 let alone a few hundred. I do not own a console or computer myself. I've been trying to answer questions in the comments but a lot of it is hard for me to justify over and over. You don't know how abusive she is mentally and emotionally... And how this has gone on for years and broken me and my mother down. My older sister is on vacation for a week and isn't here to back me up this time.\n",
      "The only time my bf wears glasses is when he is driving. However, there have been countless times when he asks me what a sign says or what the menu says behind a bar because it is blurry. He's said before that he probably wouldn't recognize a friend if he was walking on the street. His only reasoning for not wearing glasses is because they are uncomfortable. He refuses to get contacts too. I've tried convincing him otherwise but everytime he refuses and says he is fine. I just want for him to be able to see better since his eyesight is clearly not the best. Am I the asshole?  Edit: his eyesight is -1.75 both eyes\n",
      "I (19 f) was gifted a car for my 16th birthday and I could never be more grateful, I absolutely love my car. My younger brother (17 m) has been using my car for practice and start learning how to drive, this originally wasn't a problem for me because my car was the only small car in my family and was easy to drive.  About 6 months later he has completely taken over my car and using it to drive himself, his friends, and his girlfriend everywhere and it was around this time that I had to quit my job to focus on school so I had saved a bunch to make sure I still had the money for food and gas to last me a while before I had to look for another job.  &#x200B;  To add more background information for my reasoning for being annoyed is that by the age of 15 I started working and started to become somewhat more independent. I only did this because both of my parents kept pressuring me into getting a job when I really didn't want to, they kept expressing the saying that \"I already had a job when I was your age\", and since I just wanted to make my parents proud I got a job as a filing manager at some dentist office. Since I got the job so young and I didn't know how to drive, my mom would pick me up after school and drive me directly to my job and then pick me up about 5 hours later, and she would always express her feelings on how I needed to learn how to drive ASAP because she didn't have time to be driving me back and forth for 5 days a week. So then I was able to borrow my grandma's car and she taught me how to drive and that's about when I was gifted the car for my 16th birthday and again I am extremely grateful for the car, we aren't a wealthy family so I know both of my parents worked hard to get me that car.  After feeling extremely frustrated for a while I finally brought the topic up to my parents. I had told them that it was not fair that I have to pay for gas when I rarely use my car and my brother doesn't have to pay at all. They had told me \"how is he supposed to pay for gas without a job?\", and this question almost made me lose it. I had told my dad \"when I was his age I already had 2 jobs and was paying for not only gas, but my phone bill, and my car insurance\", and he had no response to that. After I had calmed down, again I told them \"I just wish you guys treated me and him the same because it's not fair to me that I had to get a job so young and work to pay for my car insurance, when he doesnt have to do any of that\", again they basically had ignored me at this point and I knew that I would never get my point across them.  After all this, I have decided to ditch the car altogether and refuse to pay for gas, instead, I started riding my bike everywhere and even to college, since I am lucky to live near the school. This makes him extremely upset because he can no longer go out as much as he used to and called me an asshole for not using my car when my parents bought it for me to use.  &#x200B;  AITA?\n",
      "Listen, I’m extremely dumb when it comes to things that should or shouldn’t be said, it’s probably a common sense thing but I was curious about it. So I was talking to this girl that I liked about her ex and I I don’t remember exactly wait I said, but I said something along the lines of, “maybe you didn’t like me then so that’s why you hooked up with him.” The reason why I said that was because the night prior, she told me that she liked me even before they started dating. And I didn’t believe her bc that was so mind boggling at the time be no one has ever liked me beforehand. Well she took offense to me saying that she hooked up with her former bf and I didn’t have any negative connotation to that and I wasn’t saying anything bad about her bc I thought she was great. Afterwards she blocked me a couple of days later.And this was after a good 3 months of talking. So AITA, this whole thing has been pretty tough on me and I’d like to settle this debate in my mind once and for all, even if the answer is that I’m an asshole.\n",
      "I know this sounds really wrong but please, hear me out.   My wife has a girl gang, a group of women who’re very close friends and always support each other. One of the girls in this gang is Jill. Jill is a lesbian. Jill always has had this tiny crush on my wife. My wife knows about this. I know. Jill knows we know.   In fact, Jill also jokes around me that my wife would’ve been with her, had I not been in the picture. Now, I am possessive but I trust my wife. Also, Jill has always respected my wife’s boundaries given that she’s straight, and has never done anything to make her uncomfortable. Jill had assured my wife that it was just harmless infatuation and nothing to worry about.   Yesterday, my wife arranged a barbeque party for her friends, all 7 of them, and the plan was to announce that she’s pregnant (we’ve only recently found out).I was working in my home office when I heard Jill crying and Amy, another of my wife’s friends, consoling her. Jill was saying that my wife is too young to be pregnant (she’s 29), she shouldn’t be pregnant. Basically, rambling about the pregnancy and crying. Amy was telling her that it’s high time she got over my wife and that they don’t have any chance. Jill replied saying that she  did  have a chance with my wife up until now and this  wretched  baby ruined it for her.   I don’t think they knew I was home as they were talking pretty loudly in the living area. The door to my office was open so their voices were very clear. I’ve debated about whether to tell my wife or not, afaik she’s only aware about Jill having a minor crush on her and not the extent of her feelings. I feel like I would want to know if I was in my wife’s position. However, this might significantly affect their friendship.   WIBTA if I told my wife that Jill is in love with her?\n",
      "Alright so before I start, this is my first time posting here so please be kind about any errors.  Anyways, today is my birthday and I wasn’t planning anything big for it. No get togethers with friends, no party, no nothing. I just wanted to chill at home and maybe get a cupcake from a place downtown.   By no means is my town a big place, so it’s not easy to get lost here. And since I live with my dad since I’m not yet old enough to get my own place, I figured we could both go to a cute little cupcake place near one of the neighboring towns.    I ask my dad and he agrees, so we head off to the cupcake place. I hadn’t told him any specific location for the cupcake shop, only the name and that “it’s near [neighboring town name] I think!”  He assures me that he knows where it is, and proceeds to drive in a completely different direction than the cupcake shop. I piped up a few times, saying “Hey I don’t think the place is in this area, it’s by this cat shelter in our town.” He, however, continues driving in the same direction, insisting he knows where he’s going. I go with it, thinking he maybe found another route to cupcake place. Nope. He had an entirely different place in mind, which didn’t even have the same name. Disgruntled, I get a bit snippy in telling him he was going the wrong way and to the wrong place. In turn, he gets angry with me and we spend the drive back to our town in silence. Mind you, the place where he was going was a good 30 MINUTES out of the way to where we were supposed to be.  A few times during the ride, he tries to make small talk and I just shoot him a glare or ignore him (in hindsight, this was an assholeish move by me.) When we finally arrive at the shop, tensions are running high and he makes a snarky remark at me before we step in, “God, can’t you just drop it and be grateful?”  So I in turn mumble at him in tears  “Yeah, thanks for helping me have a shitty birthday.”  He turns around and says “What did you just say? Come on, say it to my face” but I’m just falling apart by then and say I want to go home.  So I guess I’m just sitting here crying and writing this post. So tell me, Reddit, aita?\n",
      "It’s not like he isn’t used to this practice.  I’ve shared a room with my older brother for 18 years now. We’re 7 years apart and he’s still living at home at age 25. For as long as I can remember, whenever our room has been messy, I have either cleaned it or come home from school to a mountain of my belongings on my bed. The most annoying part about these experiences is that even if something is obviously not mine, it will be on my bed because my brother knows that it is not his. Not his property, not his problem. It becomes  my  problem.  Again, he has thrown everything in the room that isn’t his into my bed for  me  to clean. I’ve never done something like that while cleaning the room because I am considerate. Considerate of the fact that, after someone comes home from work/school/whatever, the LAST thing they want to do is clean. He obviously hasn’t considered that when piling things on top of  my  bed. He can be a pretty inconsiderate person.  In the past I haven’t been the best at cleaning up behind myself, but as I’ve matured, I do so a lot more often. I can’t say the same for my brother though, who often likes to criticize others when they don’t practice the most hygienic things, which is hypocritical of him because he isn’t the most hygienic when it comes to cleaning the room. My cousin actually stayed with us for a while and pointed this out to me. I didn’t even notice and wouldn’t have thought of it, I just try not to cause conflict.  Just yesterday my brother and I had another conflict. Since the last one I just described, I’ve learned how to keep my emotions in check and stay unbothered by his words. To make this post much shorter, I’ll sum it up. He nearly threw something of mine away, and while I left to get it I slammed the door on my way out, and he opened it immediately and yelled “What?” He said it in the way someone would say when they’re about to get in a fight. I don’t know why, but he always wants to solve conflicts with violence. He can do this because he either used to or does work out and is therefore physically stronger than me. What a weak-minded person. The day he touches me is the day I stop being friendly and the day I petition to get him kicked out of our mom’s house. I love him but he can be such a weak-minded asshole. We wouldn’t even get along if I weren’t such a passive person, I let a lot of shit slide.  The best part about cleaning the shit up from the corner is that all of it was his. He’ll have to figure out where to put everything after he gets off from his 8-hour shift. I shouldn’t feel this good for being an asshole but it was a long time coming, given that he’s done it several times without regard for how I felt. It feels therapeutic, as I need to stop thinking about other people when they don’t think about me.  AITA?\n",
      "This happened when I was a kid, I was about 9 and it was summer. To give some context to what I was like- I didn’t like being touched if I didn’t initiate it, and had a hard time telling people no/expressing my feelings. The school I went to was super small, 45 kids and a few staff members so I was friends with everyone in the school- especially when there was new kids. There was a new girl who I met in church, and she was pretty cool. I went to her house, and met her family.  One of her younger brothers was autistic, it was new but not unheard of- for me at least. We accepted him, and of course he was allowed into the games and other stuff we did as kids- we knew he was different but when has that stopped us from doing anything? I tried to keep my distance (from everyone) but everyone thought I didn’t like him. This isn’t where the story ends though. We went to the lake- a popular summer hangout since it was a lake and got the kids away from the tv/computer. I always liked swimming, and I was going from dock to dock and around the different areas while mostly ignoring people. I had gone to the T-dock connected to the shore- and was treading water by the edge of the dock. Most kids left before dinner time- but my parents often let me stay till dusk. It was a small group, the new girls family and one of my other friends. They got in for one last swim- we were going to the two story dock and jumping off as usual, and NG’s brother joined us. I didn’t have a problem with it- but at one point while I was under water he grabbed my bathing suit straps and pulled it down. I was panicked- trapped underwater with someone on top of me and yanking me around. I started to panic and struggle and thrashed about as I went to the farthest point I could. When I got back to the shore NG’s mom yelled at me saying I should understand that he’s autistic and I need to treat him different. The new girl, my old friend and my old friends mom all yelled at me for a bit telling me that I should’ve ‘handled that better’ and ‘been more mature about the situation’ I’m not saying I handled it with any grace/intelligence, but did I really handle it that badly? He wouldn’t have hurt me and I could hold my breath for a surprisingly long time for a 9 year old. I could’ve stayed in the part that he couldn’t go to since it wasn’t THAT deep, or even just have not flailed about.\n",
      "So its Sunday and like every Italian child who lives in Brooklyn I(14M) got dragged to Church well my mom was running late and I saw some of my friends outside so I went out. I originally only had the intent to talk and watch them skate but I ended on my friends board and did a kick flip. Well right after my mom came out and started yelling at me. I legit did one trick but she was upset about getting my BLACK  dress shoes dirty while we were on the sidewalk. AITA?\n",
      "Background: this happened years ago he’s a mechanic now he makes 40$ an hour, but recently someone in my family brought this up with a new family friend who wasn’t aware and he started saying I was an asshole and things like that so I’m genuinely curious as to weather or not I was an asshole letting my son drop out.  Okay so my son Jake, his whole life he hates school, he’s smart gets perfect grades but he hates it, why? He wants to be a mechanic (he’s 26 now so this was a LONG time ago) I’m 43 now,  he’s always wanted to be a mechanic he found out drop outs can get a job as a mechanic so he asked me if he could drop out, I was hesitant at first but he really took the time to explain everything, that he’d of course get his GED, that he would be taking courses to be a mechanic, that it pays pretty well, after thinking about what was in his best interest and what was best for him I let him drop out, he ended up doing extremely well, he makes $40 an hour that’s more then me. I couldn’t be prouder.  But this family friend says I was an asshole and bad parent for letting him drop out at 16 even though we really thought it through and he already had a plan and we knew that was in his best interest, he says even though he makes a lot of money he could of been a doctor or lawyer, my son always wanted to be a mechanic since he was like 4, always interested in cars and stuff, always learning about them, he used to save up money and buy pocket bikes off Craigslist and then fix them up for his friends, he was talented at this so I feel like it was the right choice in the long run, he said he couldn’t be happier I let him,  But in principle am I wrong for letting a 16 year old drop out? I think I may be the asshole because it was unconventional to let him drop out but I also think I’m not because he knew what he wanted and it worked out well for him, am I the asshole?   (Should add he didn’t actually start working as a mechanic till 18 because of legal reasons and requirements)\n",
      "This is my first aita post so go easy on me if I do something wrong.   Little back story on myself. So I work at a smaller bible camp in rural Minnesota. We can hold and maximum of 160 campers and staff. So if that helps put it into perspective. My dad used to be on the bord out here for over 10 years he knows the managers very well. This is not my only job, I also work at a grocery store and cut grass for my stepmothers farm. On a typical week I will work close to 50-55 hrs a week between the three jobs. I am trying to make some money for me to take to college as I will be entering my freshman year this fall.   When I first came out to the camp for an Interview they told me that they would primarily need me on Friday afternoons and Sunday afternoons (and during the week to help cut grass, and there is a fuck ton of grass to cut witch all of the grass has been placed on to me) . At the time this was no problem as I had no big trips planned for the summer. They also told me that they would like to hire an additional person to help out at the camp. Also there youngest son who is 21 still lives with them and occasionally helps (he is lazy as they come and only does the bare minimum). So as of the time of writing this they have failed to hire anyone else to help besides the two of us. With an absolute fuck ton of work that needs to be done everyweek. Now keep in mind the people that I'm am talking about dont own the camp they just work/live here.   Now to the conflicting question. My girlfriend of 5 months is going to be going to Oklahoma and they invited me to come down with them. Now the trip will take place on July 25-28 it is a weekend. This for me is going to be the only opportunity for me to be able to see any of the United states before real life adulting begins and start my life.   This trip is kind of important to me. So as soon as I found out that I'm going I texted my boss on July 6th that's almost 20 days in advance. I said \" Hey so I'm going to be taking a trip to Oklahoma on July 25-27 I know this is on shorter notice but I just found out about the trip. The 28th is a Sunday and I should be able to come out that afternoon after I get back.\"  (This is where I fucked up on my end, I didnt read the text right and I wont be back till the 28 but we will get to that.).   My managers replied with \"Ok, it would have been nice to know this awhile ago. We will for sure need you the 28th. Hopefully Joel can help us on that Friday, we will have the whole camp and cabin to do that day. Scott.\"   (After realizing my mistake the next day I send them the text that says)   \"So it seams that I read the itinerary for the trip wrong I wont get back to Minnesota until late on the 28th my apologizes for the mistake \"   They have not replied to my text and where very short with me today so far at work. So this is the real question am I the asshole for taking this almost once and a life time trip and giving them almost 20 days notice?\n",
      "I [28] live with my parents and I constantly have to deal with my parents problems. My parents are nice people but they keep taking on responsibilities that they cant handle. I know they have good intentions of taking on those responsibilities, but they cant handle it most of the time. For some reason, they expect me to help even though it is stressful for everyone. I fixed most of their problems but this time, I'm tired of it.   I keep warning them to stop helping other people but they dont listen to me. They get so stressed out that I feel so bad for them. This is why I help them all of the time with their responsibilities. This time, the problem they are dealing with is too much for them to handle. My mother is going insane, and actually had a mental breakdown.  I feel like an asshole because I know if I cast away my mental health and help them, their stress level will be reduced and the problem might be resolved. But I feel like they will add more responsibilities once this problem is over and then the cycle repeats again.  So reddit, AITA if I stop helping my parents with the problems they create?\n",
      "Hey guys, longtime lurker but I could use some help deciphering how to approach this situation.   I decided to get a new roommate a couple months back. So, I headed to facebook and started doing interviews. I ended up meeting a 29 year old guy who I felt like would be a decent fit. He was a very nice but quirky dude. He obsessed about spider-man and his physical things. He always felt the need to tell me about the new \"thing\" that he just bought. Overall I didn't mind but all this to say, he was a pretty quirky dude.   &#x200B;  When we would talk he would mention how sheltered he was growing up. He held a lot of resentment towards his fairly extreme fundamentalist religious family. He felt they set him back in ways that he may never be able to recover from. He said they would keep him from hanging out with other kids his age because they were worried about bad influences. All the pieces kind of came together as to why his oddities manifested the way they did.   &#x200B;  Fast forward three months and he decides even though living together hasn't been bad, he wants his own place. I understood and he left on really good terms. Hugs and all.   &#x200B;  Within a month of him leaving I get word that he passed away in a motor wreck. I have pretty unsatisfied feelings about the whole situation. I was really looking forward to watching him grow as a person away from his family. I was told of what happened 4 days after his passing. So I went to Facebook to try and get the word out about his passing. There were no posts mentioning his death and I wanted people to know. His family reached out to me a day later asking for the post to be taken down for privacy reasons and their grieving.   &#x200B;  I have a hard time caring what they think because of the how much I know the guy didn't care for them. I've never met them, I don't wish them any more pain but I'm also grieving alone cause he didn't get out much and no one really knew him. The situation kind of sucks but AITA for posting about a passing nearing a week at this point?   &#x200B;  Input appreciated. Sometimes emotion makes it hard to think clearly. Thanks.\n",
      "So I've been friends with \"Yiffer\" for quite some time and over the years we've developed a good relationship and can relate on a lot of things. We play games together, have little debates with his friends over controversial subjects, sometimes even meet up (since we met on a local Discord group), you name it. I was willing to go above and beyond for Yiffer and do anything to make him happy.  That is, until he told me that he recently became a furry.  I told him a while back that I didn't like furries. I saw what happened at RainFurrest. I saw what Kero did to those poor puppies. I saw how the Discord admins defended cub porn. I've seen how thirsty and horny on main they can be. They do all sorts of taboo actions that the general public would NEVER think of doing. They bitch and moan about all the hate they get, when they only have themselves to blame for it.  So a few days ago, Yiffer told me that he had something that he wanted to confess to me. I told him that as long as it wasn't anything godawful, he could confide in me. That's when he broke to me that he had recently become a furry after seeing all the art and cute suits and met a few at a pride parade.  Needless to say, my jaw dropped, and I was disappointed.  I immediately started berating him for it, how being a furry is bad, how there's a lot of shitty people in the fandom, and furry drama blows up on Twitter every other week, and all the bad things furries do.  He played the \"It'S tHe LoUd MiNoRiTy\" card but I fired back with how furries only care more about how they appear on the outside than dealing with their internal problems within, and that if it indeed is a minority, it's like 1/3 of the fandom instead of something like 5%.  Then he said that furries donate millions to charities and make kids happy. I said that literally says nothing about the fandom itself, it doesn't excuse the shitty actions furries do in any way. Chick-fil-A donates millions of dollars to anti-LGBTQ foundations, it's shitty logic.  He then said how the furry fandom is just as sexual and problematic as any other fandom. I laughed and said no. You don't hear as much bad news from other groups as you do with furries.  The final question he asked was if I still saw him as a friend, at least a decent human being. I then told him straight up that if he was willing to let himself fall into something that will corrupt every fiber of his being and psyche, if he was willing to find animals attractive and become a hornball who prioritizes their dick over everything, then maybe it's best if we aren't friends.  He then cried and threw a few hurtful slurs at me before saying goodbye and blocking me.  I don't know, should I have just arbitrarily cut him out like this? I mean he was my friend for 1.5y but at the same time I am NOT going to associate myself with furries.  Unless if I'm wrong. If so, please let me know.\n",
      "Little background, in March my girlfriend and I moved into a new apartment complex that requires all cars to put a sticker in your back window to prove you live there. You are allowed to have guests with cars for a couple days, but more than that you have to get a temporary sign to let management not to tow your car. There is no assigned parking and no visitor parking, it's just a free for all on spots. There are way more parking spaces than residents in the buildings so we are never fighting for a space.  Toward the end of April I noticed a car parked close to our building had been there all month and as far as I can tell, has not moved. In May, my girlfriend also commented that she noticed the same car and thought the same thing, that it hadn't moved. Next time we left to go somewhere we took a look and the car in question did not have the parking sticker.   It is now August and the car still has not moved at all. So Redditors, would I be an asshole for reporting this car to management?   This is my first AITA post so apologies in advance for errors or poor formatting.\n",
      "For context; I am currently six months pregnant with mine & my husband's first child. Initially, I was going to allow my father, and my husband's mother and sister to visit after delivery but recently decided that I wouldn't want any visitors other than my husband.  My husband sat down with his mother and explained to her that I no longer want any visitors in the hospital and that we'd be happy to facetime her for 30 mins to an hour as a compromise. Also that we don't really want any visitors for the first three weeks because I'll be healing(especially since it's likely I'll be having a c-section). From what I understand, I'll be in pain, crabby and likely won't be in the mood to entertain guests ogling my newborn baby & trying to get me to pass her around like a bottle of vodka.  After my husband told her the expectations and boundaries we would be implementing, she went absolute batshit on him and claimed that I'm trying to \"keep her from her grandchild and son\" by \"putting her son in a cave and not allowing him near his family\". She then went on to say that /I/ am a total weirdo and a disgusting slob and that my husband and I don't know the first thing about raising a baby and we are being \"ridiculous\" for \"keeping her\" from the baby.  But the thing is is that we are NOT keeping her from the baby, this is a boundary we have set with EVERYONE, including my family. What she has failed to realize is that just because she is the grandmother does not mean she is entitled to see the baby whenever she wants.  So, AITA for not allowing visitors?\n",
      "I’m currently using a mobile device and this is my first time posting, so I’m extremely sorry if the formatting is a bit odd. I’m also sorry if this is super long, it’s just been bothering me for a while now.  Hi, I’m a 16 year old enby and I’ve felt this way for a long time now, and I’ve felt comfortable enough to tell the closest people in my life about it. My friends are super supportive of me and use my preferred name (for now, let’s call it “P”). However, my parents refuse to use it and proceed to call me my deadname (“D”). I’ve tried my best to talk to them, my mother especially, since she’s the one who seems to control my life the most. I try my best to tell her how it hurts me when she calls me D, rather than telling her it’s disrespectful since I don’t want her to get defensive. She begins to make me look like a bad person because I’m the one who’s hurting her when I call myself P, and D is a gender neutral name. But it still makes me uncomfortable when she, or anyone, calls me that. When I ask her to at least try to adjust, knowing things like this takes time to get used to, she begins to yell at me and the arguments (usually) go the same way. (M will be my mother and I’m OP).  M: So, D, what do you want for dinner?   OP: I don’t really care.. But can we talk about my name?   M: I’m not calling you P. At school and with family, you’re D.  OP: But I’m home and we’re not at a family gathering, so please at least try to call me P.  I try to explain to her how it feels and she brushes it off and says “Oh please, OP, get over it”, completely disregarding how I feel about it. Especially since it’s the end of November, and I’m going to be going to more family gatherings, and nobody related to me really knows about this other than my parents. Both of them care a LOT about reputation, and I guess this wouldn’t do it any good. Especially for my brother, who’s 17 and is close to a couple people who are in my classes.   But every time this conversation happens, it ruins my mental health.. I just want to be happy. Am I being too overdramatic about this? What should I do? Should I let it go? AITA for wanting my mother to stop deadnaming me?  Update: Thank you all for your advice, reassurance, and support. So unfortunately, they’re still deadnaming me, but they’re slowly trying their best to avoid using my deadname. They’re mostly using my name as a nickname rather than an actual name, but we’re making progress so that’s all that matters!\n",
      "AITA for telling my boss he has a thick skull and a small brain.  &#x200B;  I work 8.5 hours for a company. the company deducts half of an hour for one of my lunch breaks because it is not paid for. so technically I get paid 8 hours with 1 paid lunch. I'm telling my foreman I get 2 lunch breaks. he seams to think the company is only entitled to pay me for 1 lunch break. I understand that but what is the point of working 8 .5 hours total with the paid lunch if the company is only going to pay me 8. can i not just go home after 7.5 hours and have the company pay me by law 8hrs. basically my boss expects me to work 8.5 hours and have half and hour deducted and only get 1 break\n",
      "Six weeks ago my brother went through brain surgery and it has caused me a lot of stress and anxiety. I have actually started seeing a therapist about it. For Six weeks I fell behind in school and started missing a bunch of assignments. Yesterday, my science teacher called me in to her office and said “I know your brother went through brain surgery, but shouldn’t you be over it by now? Like what’s wrong with you. Why can’t you turn in any work? You were not the one that went through the surgery.” Is it ok for me to hate her?\n",
      "After my grandma passed I was allowed to keep her diary. I never knew her, and I felt this would be a great way to get to know her.  After reading it, that’s exactly how I felt. I felt like she was telling me stories about her life. She was very poetic, and it really made me fall in love with her personality.   When I told my friend about it, she seemed upset. She thinks I crossed a boundary and that I shouldn’t have read her diary. She said that diaries are private, and that I should have respected that.   AITA?\n",
      "Fairly recently, my best friend and I went to a debate competition for school. We were supposed to do a skit together, with no costumes or props. A few weeks before the competition, we were discussing what to wear. She told me that she was going to wear a black dress from her younger sister. Hearing this, I remembered the one time I had previously seen her in a dress. That time, she looked worse than she usually did (she's actually very pretty) but I felt like the dress made her look \"stocky.\" She looked like she had super broad shoulders and looked generally bigger. Not fatter, just bigger. So I told her gently that maybe she should wear a nice shirt with nice pants or a skirt. Keep in mind that we were told to dress formally, and that probably fits into that category. She quickly got defensive and in my opinion, overreacted. I told her that it was just my opinion, and that I just didn't want her to feel uncomfortable in what she was wearing. She quickly ended the conversation and we didn't talk about it any more. A few weeks later, we go to the competition and she looks great in her dress. I made sure to compliment her.  Reddit, was I the asshole for telling my friend that maybe she shouldn't wear a dress to a debate competition? Edit: not sure if this makes much of a difference but this was my first competition and I was terrified. I wanted to do well. in the competition, everything she did would affect my score. How she behaved, dressed, and performed also affected MY score. More editing: I was thinking and there are a lot of details I left out.    Before this, we had both agreed that we would be honest with each other about clothing choices and things like that.  The judges for the competition were volunteers from competing schools. The only training they were given was a ~10 minute presentation, and a lot of the volunteers did not pay attention. They would probably write down everything for no reason. They would obviously judge in favor of the school they were representing. Most of the volunteers didn't even want to be there. The competition stated you needed a volunteer per a certain amount of kids. There were still not enough workers, so they had to put judges and kids from the same school together. 3.I have a lot of pressure to do good. From my family, my friends, and my teachers. My parents were already upset about a \"bad grade\" I got. I was and still am terrified of failing them. My older brother is already a video game addict and I'm their last hope. I don't want to see them disappointed in their children.  Looking at the comments, I see that the part about the dress and the formal wear was not written well by me. I meant that pants and a shirt would also count as formal wear, as well as a dress.  I was mostly worried because she was borrowing a dress from her sister, which I thought would be small on her (her sister is two years younger), which is why I brought up the issue in the first place, along with  The other time she wore a dress, she looked super uncomfortable and told me that she would never wear a dress again, as long as she had the choice.q\n",
      "One of my teachers got arrested for domestic violence. We have a substitute but a lot of his things are( or were) there. A lot of students have been coming in the room and stealing his things. His laptop and IPad are gone and so are a lot of his stationary. All I want is to take some candy bars that he would keep and give to students who got A’s on their test. Now I know stealing is wrong but it’s not like he’ll ever need them again. He’s probably getting fired and will be blacklisted from every school if he doesn’t serve jail time. The substitute says he doesn’t care what happens to our teacher’s stuff as long as he doesn’t catch any of us taking anything. Would I be the asshole for taking the candy? The substitute won’t be giving tests and we’re just doing busy work until we get a new teacher so it’s not like anyone else is going to get them.\n",
      "My brother recently came out about not being comfortable being female. I accepted him and I urged him to talk to my parents about it since they should know about his gender. When he told my parents they kept questioning him about if he really wanted to do it. He said yes and my dad said  \"I will not refer to you as my son, you were born my daughter and you will always be my daughter\" So of course my brother got mad and he sat down. I decided to step up for him and I told my dad that it wasn't cool that he said that. He told me to shut up and that it didn't involve me. So after my dad was done berating my brother we had to go pick up something for my grandma. While we were in the car I  told my parents that it wasn't nice the way they were treating my brother.  My mom ended up getting very angry at me and she started crying to make me feel bad for standing up for my brother. My dad then started yelling at me and telling me to stop being mean to my mom. At that point, I was pissed off. So when we got home my dad sat me and my brother down he was telling my brother that he needs to stop thinking about sexuality all the time, (just like he said to me when I came out) and so I decided to step in.  I told him that times are no longer like the 80's when he grew up and that is boys and girls can date in high school, then why can't someone change their gender identity in high school. Or why can't a girl date a girl, or a boy date a boy? Then my mom came in and started telling my brother not to get his breasts removed because he might have a partner that likes his boobs. (Which is completely stupid) My mom then started saying that he needed to be a woman because we need more strong feminists in the world. Which to that I said  \"You can be a man and a feminist\" My dad then decided to be rude about my sexuality and tell me that it's stupid and I shouldn't want to date a girl at my age (complete BS.) My mom then thought it would be a good idea to tell my dad that I was bullying her earlier. And so my dad got really angry.  This was a few months ago and my parents still don't refer to my brother as a male. Sorry, this is long. I just wanted to get this out.  UPDATE: I honestly thought my parents had finally learned to respect people's sexuality because they stopped being rude to me about it until then. My brother is also 16.\n",
      "In order to explain my situation, you’ll need some backstory. About a year ago my mom met her current boyfriend and pretty soon after that we (my mom, teenage sister and I) moved into his house. (I 20F still live with my mom because I’m halfway through my bachelors). At some point after moving in I started doing him favors for his company. Some of these favors were sending emails in English, talking on the phone with clients, going to a convention to represent his company, physical labor, and archiving documents. I was honestly fine with doing these because they don’t take up much of my time, plus I live in his house rent-free so it’s whatever. The problems arise when my mom (who is now his secretary) and him go on vacation to DR. They always go on a trip every month but this time they’d be gone a bit longer, two weeks if I remember correctly.  My mom tells me I’ll have to take over the company while they’re gone and I remind her that it’ll be difficult for me as a full time student. She tells me that her boyfriend is willing to compensate me for my time, so as a poor college student I agree. They go on their trip and I juggle company business and schoolwork while they vacation. It’s not easy, but at least I’m getting paid, right?  Wrong.  It’s been 2months and I haven’t seen a dollar of what I worked for. Yeah COVIDs been tough on the company, but the companys not struggling. Over the course of the 2 months I gave him the benefit of the doubt and continued doing him favors. I thought maybe he planned to give it to me on Christmas. I found out today that he never intended on paying me, as he payed for my dog’s vet bill last month.   Of course I’m grateful he covered the bill, but I wasn’t aware he was gonna be billing me for it, especially since it’s the family dog, not just mine. I’m annoyed because he’s been having me do all these things for him while my mom basically dangled the money in my face telling me he would eventually pay me when he never intended to. And in the meanwhile they’ve gone on 2 more vacations and are currently planning a 2 month long stay in Colombia. And of course they expect me to take over the company.   At this point I don’t even care about the stupid $200, but I told them that I’ll no longer be doing them any favors, even while they’re gone. This means that he would either have to hire a secretary or they won’t be able to go on vacation. WIBTAif I didn’t let them go on vacation because I don’t wanna work for free?  I would have had no problem doing those favors for him if I hadn’t been promised a salary. But I truly feel taken advantage of and like my time and effort don’t matter to him at all. Plus I don’t remember agreeing to work for him when he begged my mom to move in with him because he could cover everything.\n",
      "I [30F] work for a very toxic boss. I work in the beauty industry where I service clients. I am opening up my own studio in a few weeks. With this type of job you typically can’t give them a heads up, as they will fire you on the spot for trying to “take” clients.   I also have a co-workers wedding that I’m supposed to be going to. If I was to quit the week of, it would make the said wedding awkward. If I leave after that though, I would be literally quitting the day after and there would be no heads up as my studio would be open.   I am in a bind here. WIBTA if I gave my boss a week or so notice I’m leaving with the wedding happening the same week or would I be an even bigger asshole if I gave them essentially one day notice afterwards?   Edit: added more info.\n",
      "We split the rent and everything else, he hasn’t had his license for about 1-2 years because he got caught with his third DUI. But he just got a blow machine in his car so he’s getting it back soon probably in the next few weeks.   Also this probably isn’t relevant but he owes me $1200 I feel the least he could do is tell me not to leave the house when I don’t feel like it, especially when I pay half here. Also have been in pain currently with my jaw. I don’t feel like doing shit.\n"
